This is an entertaining kinda romance, kinda comedy, kinda Twilight Zone. When almost the entire film rests on the shoulders of the 2 stars, they'd better be compelling. Luckily, this duo is charming. They manage to keep us interested, even when the film gets a bit talky. Still, there are sufficient surprises to keep you guessing and an engaging creation to make it fun.",

      "text": "Low-budget, yet simultaneously ambitious in conception, \"The One I Love\" reminds me of another **** of equally low budget, \"Coherence\". In both films, the premise is undeniably clever and engages us throughout, while also bringing up a number of big questions and themes relating to loyalty, identity, and reality. \"The One I Love\" makes much fuller use of it's premise than \"Coherence\" and is the better film of the two. There is a much bigger focus on character here; whereas \"Coherence\" sold it's heady premise as a challenging, yet entertaining brain-puzzle, \"The One I Love\" takes it further by adding a more honed focus on the central relationship of the couple. The performances of The One I Love are multi-faceted and subtle, our loyalties shifting from one version of a character to the other. Duplass and Moss deliver charming charism and obligatory depth. Their performances are what keeps the film engaging on a character level. The premise gets the better of the movie, unfortunately. That is to say that the film doesn't know how to resolve itself in a simultaneously thematically pleasing and conceptually rewarding manner. The ending is a bit too cynical to feel like a fitting send-off to these characters and it's too predictable and ordinary to have worked out the plot conflicts established early on in a realistic way. There are places I wish The One I Love had gone; other aspects of the premise I wish it had made use of or explored. However, this movie still has more ingenuity that most out there and it's an undeniably entertaining flick, one that stands as one of 2014s better works.",

Making you wonder what is real, in a postmodern fashion, the film is a really compelling look at a broken relationship. A truly authentic look at marriage and love, The One I Love is an interesting look psychological thriller that really messes with you mind due to that authentic foundation. This allows the film to really mess with you as it examines this fractured couple and adds in an interesting twist that really shows the problem with cheating in an already broken relationship. An incredibly odd little indie film, The One I Love is both entertaining, thoughtful, and a truly unique take on a well-traveled path.",
