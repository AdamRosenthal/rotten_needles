The movie boasts a dynamic choreography and stellar music to go with it, some are timed just right and they are admittedly entertaining. It commendably tries to bring a dancer's perspective on their life style and tribulation, but the plot often contradicts the effort by putting overly flamboyant characters or tired plot. In the end it's just another drawn out excuse for a dance battle, albeit a rather spectacular one.",

Well, director Trish Sie has done a poor, horrible and bad job on this film. The story is loose, the characters don't tie together, and the dance is also CGI made. It's just Battle Of The Year 2! Step Up 2 and Revelution were both good movies, but All In is an example of the series going downhill.",
