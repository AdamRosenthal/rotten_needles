I thought Gerard Butler did a fine job with what he was given, but what he was given was a shallow cartoonish character, who is not only rather uninteresting but unlikable to boot. If you are interested in Africa or the atrocities that have and continue to go on over there, due yourself a favor and find a documentary or other film to satiate your appetite!",

I like his realism after his conversion. I believe the way he channeled his fearlessness from something dark into something great challenges the audience to greater potential as well.",

My question is: how many modern American Preachers would actually teach in support of the efforts of San Childers and how many would condemn his methods? This R-rated film is a gritty and realistic portrayal of the unimaginable brutality still going on in the Sudan. My favorite aspect of this film was that it showed the deep flaws and humanity of Childers, his struggles, doubts and anger.",

In no way am I saying that this film was anywhere near that level. I'm just saying that some of the emotions were similar due to the similarly tragic nature of the true stories they tell. Gerard Butler leads a cast that provide great acting throughout the film and deliver on those emotions. The plot develops well and the reality of the story adds an additional layer of depth. The action sequences were a little weak and unfortunately the movie leans a little too heavily on those scenes. The constant varying perspectives makes you think and the drama is effective. I think the ending felt a bit rushed and the film lacked that climactic emotional sequence that sticks with you but overall, I think most people would really enjoy this movie.",

It isn't your typical formulaic, black/white entertainment where the good guys save the day and everything works out. Reality isn't like that. Sometimes sacrifices (even big, soul-wrenching sacrifices) have to happen. Sometimes you have to beg and plead for help from people who will never understand because they are so far removed from you. Can you imagine trying to live these two lives in the movie? I don't mean biker and Christian, or even AKs and Christian. I mean Sudan and America. One week you're with kids who are happy to have food, health, and a ball to kick and the next your wife and daughter think you don't love them if you say 'No\" to a limo for the prom. I'm guessing all these talking about whether or not Gerald Butler was a good fit for the role and \"white savior tropes\" didn't relate to the film. Which is a shame. It is so powerful and shines a bright light on the West's spoiled, self-centered society if you're willing to look. I only wish they had used a different title.",
