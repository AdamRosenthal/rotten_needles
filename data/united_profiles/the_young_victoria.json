Though Blunt and the other actors are at their very best, the film feels overstuffed. As it tries to showcase many characters and multiple years of Victoria's reign, it has the problem of feeling both incomplete and overstuffed. If it wants to introduce this many characters, it needs more runtime. If it cuts some characters, it still needs to be longer to bring every other subplot to an end.  That said, the technical elements here are very good with terrific costume design, production design, and makeup/hairstyling. All are pitch perfect and perfectly capture the 1800s England feel with the correct importance and weight to the sets. The film is also well paced, even if the story does not deliver fully. Overall, The Young Victoria is an ambitious biopic that has terrific acting and a great look, but would have been better off trimming some fat and expanding on a few things to paint a more concise and direct picture.",
