That said, this movie has one of the most spectacular (though not too dramatic) impaling scenes I've seen yet.

I though that the boats in the air were cool. But the dialogue is mediocre, the characters were disappointing, the story is cliche.

The casting was excellent as well except for the lead playing D'Artagnan whose bravado fell short of the target alongside his acting chops, or lack thereof. On the down side - stealing lines from several other films that include The Princess Bride as well as Disney's version (with Chris O'Donnell) of The Three Musketeers doesn't help the poorly scripted dialogue. Fortunately for the writers, the remaining strong cast of actors/actresses manage to make up for the lack of creativity and eloquence. Another negative is the lack of artistic liberty taken from the original story as well as the acceptable, but boring and antiquated soundtrack. Never the less I feel that this movie definitely deserves a look for those who enjoy films with swordplay and/or quasi-fictional period pieces.",
