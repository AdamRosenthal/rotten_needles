Really?\" it kinda felt like it was rehashing the first movie a little bit. but all that aside, like i said: \"22 Jump Street\" is the most hysterical buddy-cop comedy we got so far this year. and i'll be damned if this wasn't better than the first movie, cause yea it was better and funnier. (with the most hysterical end credits ever!)",

One thing that really stood out to me was how self-aware this film was, almost so much so, it becomes annoying. For example, it constantly referenced how sequels never live up to the first one, and how the plot between the two was the same. Something that bothers me in the genre of comedy lately, is the stress factored into a film that is supposed to be relaxing to viewers and hold some good laughs. 22 Jump Street handled this really well, as it had some very funny scenes while some were exaggerated, over-the-top. The movie seemed to reuse jokes and clich\u00e9 ideas that were not very entertaining. Don\u2019t get me wrong, 22 Jump Street is still hilarious, but expect the same kind of comedy as in the original. The chemistry between the two leads is great and carries the whole movie pretty well. I felt like the run time was a bit long and could have been condensed to make a better movie. The pacing was a little off, almost awkward at times, where dead-time could have been filled with more laughs or simply left on the cutting room floor; this detracted from the overall film. Unrealistic scenarious seemed to overwhelm the comedic aspect quite a bit. I have to say, I laughed my butt off. \u00a0Even though it wasn't the most creative comedy, it was simple, didn't require much thinking and let me just sit back and laugh.

Jenko & Schmidt are undercover cops, who after the success of busting out drug dealers in High School, they are out looking to bust drug dealers in college, it is obviously the same. But it is all about how they handle the movie or under handle the movie, in this case the sequel is as good as the first if not carrying some scenes more effectively, for ex: the action sequences which are tense. Jonah Hill & Channing Tatum are really great in the movie, Ice Cube is hilarious in this movie, the best part so far, and the end sequence is actually really funny and very creative. 22 Jump Street is as good and hilarious as the first film, at some parts better but formulaic and copies off the first, \"for goodness sakes I saw the twist coming!\" but it is still a fun and over the top, if you liked the first one you will also appreciate this one, it is the perfect movie for the weekend.",

With all that said the film isn\u2019t a masterpiece either. The humor feels a bit more eager/desperate to please this time around, the film is more frantic with pacing, and despite all its jokes about unoriginal sequels this film does have a fair amount of rehashing. But the main reason why this film isn\u2019t as good as the first one is it lacks the heart the first one did. All heartfelt moments feel forced and generic and the chemistry between Hill and Tatum isn\u2019t quite as strong as it was in the first film being more mean-spirited this time involving a somewhat generic argument clich\u00e9. Despite all those issues though I enjoyed the film. The saving grace of this film is that most of the jokes work really well preventing it from being a letdown and somewhat disguising the fact that this is a cashgrab. Its miles ahead of the Hangover sequels and is not the disappointment I thought it would be. If you are a fan of the first one definitely check it out as you\u2019ll probably enjoy it just don\u2019t expect a great sequel. If you didn\u2019t like the first one this one won\u2019t do anything to change your mind.  For a film that didn\u2019t needed to exist, and was probably ordered by Hollywood, Chris Miller and Phil Lord stepped up to the plate to deliver a film that may not blow you away or have the same lasting appeal as the first one but is still enjoyable and provides a lot of laughs.
