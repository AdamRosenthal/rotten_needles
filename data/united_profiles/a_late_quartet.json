This is a small film, yet with a richness that belies it's lack of an adequate advertising budget, and which stands out singularly against the tide of popcorn sequels and violent mush. This film ought to see several oscar nominations, but will likely be overlooked.. See it while you can, it is a dying breed of film, that focuses on quality of portrayal, character development, and an keen honesty that leaves you entertained, and like good poetry... with a razor sharp grasp of the intimate relationships that are the musical world of  quartets.",
