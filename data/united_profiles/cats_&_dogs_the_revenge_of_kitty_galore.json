Seriously what company would wait for nine years to make a sequel to a film that didn't need one in the first place. I hated everything about this film. All it was was a rehash of the first films plot which involves a cat bent on taking over the world and some dogs trying to stop the mad feline. The only difference is that the dogs team up with the cats. This film made me laugh a few times, but not enough to recommend this movie. Plus the ending leaves opened for a sequel that will probably never see the light of day. Hopefully this is the final film in the Cats and Dogs Franchise.",
