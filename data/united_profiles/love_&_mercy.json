To accomplish this feat the director Bill Pohlad (sp?) hired two actors---Paul Dano plays the doughy 1960s boy genius Brian Wilson and John Cusack plays the 1980s battered, broken Brian Wilson.  The trick works magically.  Unlike most music biopics this one takes you deep into the creative process using what I think are the original recordings.  It would have been easy to make a lush, conventional music biopic given the gorgeous Beach Boys soundtrack.  To the filmmaker's credit, he pushed beyond conventions and found real truth--a bit like Brian Wilson himself.  Don't miss it.",

Both actors are mesmerizing, brilliantly capturing Wilson's complexity and charisma. As the woman who saves him, the usually outsize Elizabeth Banks is a quiet revelation. Producer-turned-director Bill Pohlad has crafted a compellingly complex examination into the creative process and one of the most effective studies of mental illness ever on screen. Although the musician's oppressive struggles keep the film in a continual dark place (with a sometimes slow pace), the film's quiet power and artistic mastery create an enthralling cinematic exploration.

Getting to see classic songs being made is a really cool experience, even if it is just a reenactment. The way the old scenes of them in the studio are shot is really well done, as it looks like old footage you would see on a music documentary. This one is pretty well written, though I did not feel it was overly inventive with the music biography genre, as many reviews state it was. While not entirely conventional, I did not think it differed too much from that formula, even though I really do enjoy the formula.

The dual performances are a triumph for both Paul Dano, who flawlessly portrays Wilson's slowly becoming overwhelmed and his psyche crumbling, and John Cusack, who is every bit a fragmented and lost Wilson. Elizabeth Banks and Paul Giamatti compliment to the cast greatly as friend and foe of Brian Wilson. It shows us the life and torment of a man who made great music.",

      "text": "I had very little insight on Brian Wilson before watching this film. I was aware of some of the significant Beach Boys songs but other than that I had no information on his life or his struggles. The first thing this film does right is break the film into two parallel storylines and casts two actors for the same man. I think it is cool that we can see wo actors play Wilson because Brian Wilson was a completely different man after being put under the supervision of Dr. Eugene Landy. Paul Dano, who is so good at playing characters the audience is forced to hate in movies like 12 Years a Slave and Prisoners, but Dano is a likeable actor in this movie and he does an excellent job and I would say that he outplayed John Cusack although his performance is no slouch either.",

There is a certain sense of sadness that runs through the narrative that's carefully navigated by director Bill Pohlad. As Brian Wilson slides in and out of various degrees of madness, so does the movie, which proves to be a real rollercoaster of emotions. It also has an amazing sound track of the incredible music library that Wilson has produced over the years. Where was this movie come Oscar time?",
