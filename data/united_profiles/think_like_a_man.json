Michael Ealy is a very versatile actor, and has the ability to make you believe that he is not acting, that this is real life.  And of course, there is the beautiful and talented Gabrielle Union. If our society, including our movie industry wasn't so 'segregated' Gabrielle would be a household name. And finally there is perhaps the most stunning actress in Hollywood: yes that is right: Megan Good! Never heard of Megan? Then go see this movie. If your socks are not wet from drool, then you either have no socks, or no pulse.  I only give this movie a 9 because some of the relationship resolutions were a little contrived.

The film  lacks economy of characters, having unnecessary, anonymous, redundant characters with nothing to do.  Like so many self-help books, \"Think Like a Man\" offers superficial insights of no real help, glossing over its ideas rather than exploring them.  The movie is shameless in plugging the book the film is based on, as the characters chant, \"Steve Harvey says..\" when Steve Harvey doesn't have anything meaningful to say about love and relationships--and neither does this movie.

The movie seems like it goes on and on forever, rather than it being like 100 minutes. It just drags on forever. If they had added the funny guy \" the one telling the story\" the movie would of been a HIT! That's my opinion. The biggest thing was that it dragged on FOREVER and that it was not funny..",

If tickets wernt so expensive I'ld go see it again no doubt! This movie gets stale at times, but it's fresh and thats what I love alot about it. I cant wait to purchase this movie when it comes out! What ever money was spent on filing the money was well spent because they've made a laugh out loud comedy enjoyable for alot of people!",

This movie is the entire package and a must see if you are either in or out of any relationship. Read a bit more about this movie at chique-critique.blogspot.com",
