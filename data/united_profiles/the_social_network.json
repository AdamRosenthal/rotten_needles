Eisenberg was good at depicting a selfish and antipathic protagonist, that's true. The music was good.

Add to this one is abruptly dropped from the film and focus is centered on the other I began to wonder why not focus on one in the first place. One of my biggest problems with the film was Jessie Eisenberg and writer Aaron Sorkins Portrayal of Mark Zuckerberg. As one character puts it \"you're not an  but your trying very hard to be one.\" This is the perfect description of the character, who is completely unlikeable with his rambling monologues and irritating behavior. The rest of the cast too is unbearable and i would struggle to find I a character Iiked. The direction too leaves a lot to be desired as director David Fincher struggles at making one scene different from another as all anyone seems to be doing is sitting at a computer. The film seems to require a degree in computer programing as the character spew technical lingo constantly, helping add to the difficulty following the plot. Add to this a terrible ending and you would think this was the worst film ever, however for some reason the film was one I couldn't stop watching for some reason.",

Rather, I felt like I was watching an intervention where everyone else could freely speak except the very person at the centre of the screen. Instead of a balanced, well-rounded portrayal of the facts, the filmmakers dramatised the whiny testimonies of scorned 'victims' to depict a character so contorted and contrived he didn't look like a real human being. Someone as aware of his brilliance as the on-screen Mark Zuckerberg wouldn't feel insecure enough to crave acceptance into a final club. His natural genius would set him apart enough and he wouldn't waste time garnering adulation from less intelligent people to affirm that. The movie depicts the cinematic Mark Zuckerberg being so engrossed in creating revolutionary projects that he pays very little attention to social conventions and appearance. Yet the same acutely logical person wastes a chunk of the movie being envious that his friend Eduardo is more 'popular'. To create a Shakespearean-like tragedy, Aaron Sorkin afflicted the protagonist with various 'fatal flaws' to amplify conflict. Facts were twisted to fit into the salacious story the filmmakers wanted to tell. Real people were twisted to fit into the salacious characters the filmmakers wanted to show. The movie was nowhere as clever as it thought it was and by the end of the first scene you knew exactly what it was trying to say ('social misfit invents new way to socialise'). It's as if the filmmakers started the film with that message and then worked backwards, fitting real life people and events around that theme rather than use the truth.  At its worst, TSN was slanderous non-fiction masquerading as entertainment. At its best, it was entertaining fiction masquerading as fact....Either way for me it didn't live up to its hype.",

That said, a key reason The Social Network is so over-praised, and many viewers and critics are so thrilled by it, is because so many viewers and critics of the film, critics especially, are bi-coastal Jews who are thrilled by the film's story about a \"meritocratic\" Jewish \"genius\" at Harvard who screws the WASP Porcellian aristos, whose club he could no more join than jump over the moon, out of the profits for their own idea by stealing it. It's the ethnic and class politics that make the film over-rated the way Sophie's Choice, a good but not great film too, also was. David Denby in The New Yorker even calls Zuckerberg a \"hero.\" Of what? Moxie? Chutzpah? By that standard, Madoff was a super-hero. At the same time, the film itself seems almost a critical meditative allegory of the way the battle for money and status in America that Jews have had to wage, by hook or by crook, against the once-dominant, anti-Semitic, and exclusionary WASP upper-class has warped some Jews and undermined the moral values of both the Jewish religion and secular Jewish humanism. In fact, Zuckerberg in the film is the most negative image of a Jew in a mainstream American film I can recall. He's an arrogant, creepy, borderline sociopathic jerk, with no evident ethical principles at all. He happily stabs his Jewish only friend in the back right along with the WASPs. He's a sort of Shylock of software, but much less ambiguous morally and humanly than Shakespeare's great creation. He makes Sammy Glick look like nothing. Sorkin and Rudin seem deeply interested in the cost of the Jewish race for wealth and status in Madoff's America. A timely theme indeed, and one that must be especially pertinent for Hollywood insiders like them. For unethical Jews from Madoff to Zuckerberg, America seems to have been closer to Babylon than Jerusalem, and this is a point well worth making in a film like The Social Network. Zuckerberg is a sort of book-end with Dustin Hoffman's breakthrough role for Jews in The Graduate forty five years ago. That Mike Nichols film cheered, and we all cheered with it, as Ben stole Katherine Ross from the Berkeley WASPy golden boy at the Christian altar itself. It was about time that Jews won victories like that in America with hustle and character (vs. the WASP's frat boy entitled vapidity). But instead of presenting a likable Jewish hero at odds with \"plastics,\" The Social Network gives us a total jerk unredeemed by his clumsy geekiness, a thief who seems to personify the cost in corruption of forty years of endless, relentless striving by Jews on the make like Zuckerberg in Madoff's America.",

The acting was generally good, but the movie's strength comes from its incredible screenplay and it's brilliant direction.

      "text": "THE SOCIAL NETWORK, the new film about Mark Zuckenberg and his co-founders of Facebook, has amounted great reviews and been hailed by many as the film of 2010, and even I, as a skeptic from the start, have to say that it is a brilliant movie. This not only out of its mastery of film craft such as use of music, editing, cinematography, acting, story and dialog - but also because of its timing. It's released at a time when everybody everywhere knows exactly what it's about; people watching the film are those in reality involved in the film's plot. The screenplay written by Aaron Sorkin is great, and this albeit it revolves around a story that would be fairly difficult if it hadn't been so entertainingly and intelligently written. As a viewer one watches a computer-programmer work out his mind to become the number one internet phenomena of this century, and as fore-mentioned writer Sorkin moves fast, and one has to stay focused throughout to get the entire momentum. The film feels cold, cynical and detached, much like Zuckenberg acts (greatly by Jesse Eisenberg), but it's singularly about something that gathers, interests and matters - Facebook. So there is naturally something very emotional and very human about the entire personification of numbers, codes and data as it has our name, picture and bio in it. The irony of the story is bleak and sad; it opens with Zuckerberg seated in a crowded university bar chatting intensely (to say the least) with a girl, and ends with him alone, almost blankly introspective, tapping nocturnally on the page he created - it's the man who owns the world, but sold his soul.",

Jesse Eisenberg did marvelous job as the character who created Facebook,he's mysterious,fast talking,and smart at the same time. Andrew Garfield did really good in the role,he's charming and he's smooth personality like the other actors. Justin Timberlake did a marvelously supportive job as Sean Parker and that's saying alot for the pop singer.

It is probably one of the best films this year, but that speaks more about the quality of 2010 cinema than this particular film.  Hence the 7/10, not the prefect scores going around this circle-jerk. I liked Sorkin's dialogue, and the opening sequence could not have been penned by anyone else, but I felt it was a bit forced (made it a bit harder to emotionally connect with the characters). Honestly, Fincher did not impress me on this film; cinematography was above average and the movie was very clean, but it didn't have that ability to move me that many better-directed films have.  I can't put my finger on what was missing, but I know it wasn't quite right.  I know a lot of people loved the rowing scene in England, but I honestly found it forced, too removed from the style of the rest of the film, and completely superfluous.  It was masterfully and professionally shot and edited, but I feel the choice to do it at all was amateurish (analogous to the pod race scene in Episode 1).  I was also irked by the subplots that faded off and just disappeared (like all of Saverin's personal life issues and Zuckerberg's disappearing Asian girlfriend). I also was a bit disappointed that Fincher/Sorkin decided to go with the \"it was all for the one who got away\" theme/ending, it is clearly added just for dramatic/emotional weight, but it does not deliver on it's intended purpose, it just adds cheese to the film. Other than those specific grievances, this was a great film. I know I focused more on the negative than the positive, but I think every other critic (professional and not) did enough of that for me. The Social Network is a strong, entertaining, emotive, and intellectually stimulating film.  It will be remembered.  That in mind, I do not see it as the defining film of my generation nor even my generation's Citizen Kane (which I get the feeling is what the filmmakers were attempting to create with this piece).",

He tries so hard to be like Michael Cera, that he ends up failing. His role wasn't the best either. The character of Mark Zuckerberg is to put simply, a douche bag. I'm sorry I don't want to sit there for two hours and watch some guy think his **** don't stink. I was happy that Rooney Mara's role was very short because she is one of the most annoying actress's out there. The film in itself was just generic. I felt David Fincher was selling out so he can appeal to a younger audience. Everything else was just mediocre and overlooked. The only good thing was the script. It was fresh and crisp and the dialogue was witty and tight, but it wasn't enough to save this film from becoming, just like Zuckerberg, a douche bag itself.",

This was the old template for the nerd redemption storyline; this was the dark ages, way back before computers were cool, so in order for the nerds to change their fortunes, they'd have to win some sort of competition against their adversaries. In Jeff Canew's \"Revenge of the Nerds\", starring Robert Carradine and Anthony Edwards(as Lewis Skolnick and Gilbert Lowe, respectively), the charter members of Lambda Lambda Lambda took first place at the Adams College Greek Games by defeating the other campus fraternities, most importantly, their arch-nemesis, the Alpha-Betas, and needless to say, writing code while intermittently taking shots is not one of the compulsory events. When Lewis and Gilbert first arrive at the prestigious(but fictional) school, they hang a poster of a computer on their dorm wall that reads, \"The sky's the limit,\" words that are so unerring in its propheticness, they practically build a bridge to what could be considered its sister film, a pretty sister named \"The Social Network\", a film that documents the moment when \"the meek,\" indeed does \"inherit the earth\". Case and point: the Crimson Red is facing the Dutch, not rowers captained by Mark, because now it's the jocks, in a cruel twist of faith, who have to play by the nerds' terms. The athletically ungifted never have to \"man up\" again. Nerds have come a long way since Ivan Reitman's \"Meatballs\", the Canadian indie with the original Rudy(played by Chris Makepeace), who runs a four-mile cross-country race that helps North Star defeat Mohawk in the camp's version of the Olympiad. Nerds can be ogres, too. When Mark steals the idea for Facebook from the Winklevoss twins, his kind loses the distinction of being underdogs. Nobody ever roots for the privileged white kids born with silver spoons in their mouths, but that's the subversive truth about \"The Social Network\"; the moviegoer roots for old money, the Harvard tradition, and WASPS. Whereas the moviegoer feels pity for Lewis and Gilbert as the Alpha Betas chant, \"Nerds...nerds...nerds...,\" while the two computer enthusiasts file past the house for \"jocks,\" and ironically enough, \"...facemen,\" Mark Zuckerberg's comeuppance is anticipated with glee, once Cameron(Armie Hammer) decides to \"gut the freakin' nerd,\" after they lose the regatta and learn that their intellectual property has gone on-line in England. \"The Social Network\" changes the underlying intimation of the moniker \"nerd\" when Erica(Rooney Mara) calls Mark an \"a**hole,\" in which the nerd is no longer exclusive to the receiving end of the victimization cycle, since the nerd, now empowered by their consummate fluency in the cyberspace language, can buttress the giving end, as well. Mark Zuckerberg is not your father's, or grandfather's nerd. The youngest billionaire is nothing like Lewis, who can't believe his luck in landing a cheerleader(Betty Childs, as played by Julia Montgomrey), since the Facebook co-founder treats Erica horribly for attending an inferior school. He's no dogcatcher: ugly women and BU undergrads(the Terriers), need not apply. Lewis always has Gilbert's back, especially when his best friend gives a speech, albeit hamfisted, about \"nerd persecution\" in front of the student body. Earlier in \"Revenge of the Nerds\", Lewis and Gilbert watch in silence through an open window at the emblazoned letters that spell out \"nerds\" on their lawn, after the fraternity toasts Lambda Lambda Lambda's successful completion of its provisionary period. Conversely, Mark has a knife at Eduardo's back, but he doesn't know it yet, while a silk scarf that the CFO bought for his girlfriend, burns in a trashcan, in effigy, just like the KKK-style threat made by the Alpha Betas in the Kanew film. It reduces Eduardo to nerd status, a nerd with all the old associations connected to the appellation. A loser.",

In my mind, \"The Social Network\" went further than \"Inception\" not in depth, but in pure talent, excitement, wit, and captivation. These weren't characters that were liked or disliked, it was characters that you could relate to off the bat. Eisenberg (Whom we all know from the acclaimed \"Zombieland\") rightfully deserves an Oscar for the portrayal of a genius who is as temperamental as he is flamboyant. Garfield could as well receive an Oscar for his supporting role, the business-savvy, intelligent, Eduardo Saverin, who without the character, the movie is not. He brings an attitude the movie that would be unforeseen beforehand. With great supporting characters such as the \"Winklevi\", Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss (Hammer), Sean Parker (Timberlake), and other programmers and friends that surround Zuckerberg in his daily ventures, this movie bring the new decade of the internet full circle, and greatly explains the hottest fad online over the past few years.",

Well, \"The Social Network\" is in a league of its own!  It's been four days since I've seen it and I CAN'T GET THE MOVIE OUT OF MY HEAD!  I've never watched something where I was so satisfied from beginning to end.  The acting, directing, screenplay, cinematography, score are all flawless.  Jesse Eisenberg delivers the performance of a lifetime.  He IS Mark Zuckerberg.  And even though he comes across as a genius prick, part of you can't help but root for him.  The rest of the cast are all fantastic, but its Eisenberg who makes the movie what it is.  The dialogue in the movie is the best I seen since \"Good Will Hunting\", but I would have to say its even better.  There aren't any dull moments.  The pacing is incredible.  I've never bought a soundtrack for a movie but Trent Reznor (score composer) convinced me otherwise.  His music in the movie is haunting and genius.  I can't recommend this movie enough!  And btw, the fact that it is about Facebook is irrelevant.  The themes concepts, and relationships make the movie what it is.  So do yourself a favor and  go see it NOW!",

I can't quite give it a 10 though becuase of a few nit-picks. The major problem appears to be the way the script translated to the screen. While the script was indeed brilliantly written, a ideal script should have the feel of a cast of different characters speaking for themselves. Unfortunately, when this script plays out, it sort of feels like a cast of  characters speaking for the script-writer. I know, it's a minor detail, but this excellent movie could have been positively LEGENDARY with a bit more uniqueness in the characters, and character development. Also, when your protagonist is a billionaire, you really have to try harder to get your audience to feel sorry for him/her. Whether or not 'The Social Network' is fact or fiction, I didn't leave that theater feeling any empathy for Mark Zuckerberg.

The story was supposed to be just a mess with lawsuits and betrayal of friends. But writer Aaron Sorkin turned the story into a must-see of the decade. He turned it into a witty, fast-paced, thrilling, and an Oscar-winning script. Luckily, The Social Network got David Fincher (Curious Case of Benjamin Button) as a director, which makes it even better. David Fincher's achievement in this film is going to score him another Oscar nod. (Fincher is directing The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, English version, my favorite book). The actual Facebook story is about Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg), a Harvard undergraduate (computer genius), who wrote the code for the Facebook website. Teaming up with him was him roomate Eduardo Saverin, whom later sued him for... well lots of **** Mark ran into playboy Sean Parker who convinced Mark to \"betray\" his partner (Eduardo), that's what lead to the law suit. Though people say Aaron Sorkin's script is an inaccurate potray of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who in real life is down to Earth and not an **** like in the story, I say he was just trying to make the story A LITTLE more interesting than it already is (sarcasm). Aaron Sorkin not only made the story more interesting, he made it smarter and more thrilling. Performance wise? I will have to admit that I think The Social Network will dominate the Oscars in the acting categories. Jesse Eisenberg gave one hell of a performance! Since he had been playing a loser-with-no-girlfriend kind of guy, this is really typical for him. His fast talking and annoying ass attitude really stole every scene that the camera sets on him. Andrew Garfield and Justin Timberlake also gave fine, dramatic performances which MIGHT earn them an Oscar nod. But in terms of Jesse Eisenberg, he is guaranteed an Oscar nomination (he might even win considering there is no other good movies this time of year). Directing, writing, and acting all great in one movie is rare (to say the least). The Social Network succeeds in every assets that the film was trying to achieve.",

I was pleasantly surprised with how well he was able to portray this kind of character, given what I've seen of his roles in Adventureland and Zombieland (though, to be fair, I haven't seen either of those in their entirety).  Andrew Garfield is great as Eduardo, Armie Hammer delivers a really well done, believable performance as the Winklevoss twins, and Justin Timberlake was strong portraying Sean Taylor, the young founder of Napster who manages to worm his way into the Facebook empire.",

Timberlake didn't do too badly, a little bit too much hollywood but overall an assured performance to finally rid him of his childhood acting hoodoo. The best acting performance came from Andrew Garfield, who's realism rebounded off the screen through both his happy times and jealous times. The twins were annoying but that added an almost villainous effect to their personalities. The directing was impressive and the screenplay was excellent. It was able to put across the dark undertones of the internet's favourite invention. It was a good film but I'm still not sure what the critics find so 'mesmerizing'.",

But after seeing Jesse's performance and coming from a graphic designer's standpoint of idea's, common creative licenses and protection for your work, this movie had a profound impact on my world aside from the actual social network itself.  The performances were outstanding, though hollywood embedded needless drama for some aspects of the movie, it was great overall and enjoyable. This movie is not an action movie. It is about the details of laws, privacy complaints, groupies, and the dialog. This is not Call of Duty, modern warefare. So, if you have issues about dialog, then maybe there needs to be more dialog as this world itself does nothing but text. I seriously doubt, anyone can look at anyone else in the eye anymore and explain to them via voice without any medium between them to another individual. It definitely shows the lack of social behaviors that are lost through technology as how I take it. Anyone can come up with their own theories and that is great. But, I definitely enjoyed it, especially since I am not ADD and do not need to text, or tweet every two seconds. If you are that person, this is a movie for you.",

He has solidified his place in the film industry and I'm excited to see what he will be working on next. The dialogue keeps the audience enthralled at all times, and it never  seemed to drag along. The depiction of college life was fairly accurate, but often fell short.  Even if you are the most counter-cultural person alive, you would appreciate the quality of this film. I must stress that this isn't a film about how great Facebook is, its an epic story of a young entrepreneur, fighting for a place at the top, through any means necessary.",

The next question is: who on earth is Zuckerberg? The Movie based on the 2009 book by Ben Mezrich THE ACCIDENTAL BILLIONAIRES: THE FOUNDING OF FACEBOOK, A TALE OF SEX, MONEY, GENIOUS AND BETRAYAL. Yup, the movie is about people behind the birth of Facebook, the most massive social network in our generation. In the first half of movie depicts how Zuckerberg is blogging and programming and finally ends up with launching The Facebook from his Harvard dormitory room. Someone told me, thiz movie was all about suing. Well, I think she is right. Substantively, the second half of movie is emphasizing who is the real creator of Facebook through some legal processes. Anyone can sue anyone, the question is whether he would win.  There are three important characters in thiz movie. First, Jesse Eisenberg who has been in ZOMBIELAND (2010), now played as Zuckerberg, fully equipped with his slipper. Personally, I think Eisenberg sometimes talks too fast and delivers a stiff mien. His performance is just apparently adequate. The second, The Pop Star Justin Timberlake brings a precise adept and dominant charisma into his character as Napster founder, Sean Parker. The last but not the least, actually it is the best performance for overall, comes from our next Spider-Man (2012), Andrew Garfield. Garfield gives a complete emotional package for his character, a friend and new enemy as well, Edurado Saverin. Subjectively, the book ACCIDENTAL BILLIONAIRES was advised by Eduardo Saverin himself, without any involvement from Zuckerberg side. So the point of view is fittingly one-sided. The ending of the movie itself is stagnant and flat which I am kind of surprised. Thiz movie comes from one of my favorite Directors, David Fincher. Almost half of Fincher masterpieces have a smart and twist ending, just like what we found in SE7EN (1995), THE GAME (1997), and one of my favorite movies of all-time, FIGHT CLUB (1999). But on second though, I think it is already maximized anyway, considering thiz is a biography. In the end, if you asked me: why Zuckerberg and his Facebook? Why not Bill Gates? Or anyone else? I think I can see something here. One vital element that they did not get and Zuckerberg had it. It was controversy. Controversy makes things more attractive. In these days of technologies era, whoever has the ability to conquer the internet, it is simply being God himself. Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE: http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",

      "text": "I had heard so many different things about this movie I had no real expectations going in..but after seeing it, I have to say I am still not sure how I feel about it. Yes, it is a good drama about the founding of Facebook, but what is more important is what it says about today's culture of narcissism and self importance in our youth and that scares me. I immediately recognized Aaron Sorkin's writing style based on years of watching West Wing. It is the same here, very fast, witty at times, and with Fincher's direction the movie moves along at breakneck speed. Those things don't make a best picture nominee in my mind. I didn't care for Jesse Eisenberg's portrayal of Mark Zuckerbery, but not knowing the man, it might be spot on. He has the least dialogue of all and we are supposed to understand what he is thinking by the blank expression on his face through most of the movie. I did like Andrew Garfield's portrayal of co founder Eduardo Saverin and thought he did the best job in the film. The soundtrack annoyed me, sometimes so loud I couldn't hear what the cast was saying. I hope this film isn't a true representation of what really occurred, because if so, Mark Zuckerberg is one neurotic young man..It left me with too many questions at the end.",

      "text": "As a big fan of David Fincher's work, naturally The Social Network was an instant appeal. Firstly, I don't disagree that the Social Network is a fantastic film and more evidence if any where needed that Fincher is simply sensational in the art of storytelling and directing and in particular conveying his view on each story he brings to the big screen. However, I feel as though the film is overrated. The success it has for me is largely down to Fincher and deesrvedly so but I wouldn't say it was his best piece of work. The film tells the story of Mark Zuckerberg and how he went from beginning with an idea to building an empire in the face of Facebook and all the lawsuits that Zuckerberg was served with. This is shown through flashbacks. I'll grant you the film is engrossing and very well told and Jessie Eisenberg's portrayal of Zuckerberg is great but you would expect every last detail to be explained to the moon and back when Fincher is in town. But Eisenberg is upstaged by Andrew Garfield who is delivers a mezmerising performance as Zuckerberg's decieved best-friend its no surprise to see his stock continue to rise after his performance as Eduardo Saverin here. The surprise success of the film is Justin Timberlake. Ive seen some of the criticiscm of Timberlake and his depiction as Ben Parker but I thought he was shockingly awesome in the role. The film is a real eyeopener and without doubt a fine film which showcases Finchers unquestionable ability and although I couldn't disagree that it is one of the most hyped and critically acclaimed films I just feel that it failed to meet the expectations and was ultimately left wanting more from the film.",

I don't want to make this review too long, but while the cast is very talented, the soundtrack is very good, and the direction and editing are crisp and effective, what truly makes this film great has to be Aaron Sorkin's screenplay.  The dialogue is fast and visceral, believable and generally funny, without making the movie comic.  At the same time, the screenplay is written almost as a study of human nature, showing the consequences of arrogance and ego, and what one would be willing to sacrifice to reach incredible heights.  Anyway, this movie is classic, and I think any frequent movie-goer should watch it.  I can't really find anything to complain about so 10/10.

This is a sophisticated, entertaining, thrilling film. The camera at David Fincher's command takes us on a fast paced journey to the success and personal loss of the facebook creators. The performances are top notch especially by Eisenberg and Garfield, who really are at the emotional center of all the conspiracy and greed going on but the movie never lingers on the emotions for too long and it really balances all aspects really well. The editing may seem superficial and fast but what's brilliant is all the substance behind every character and scene that the editing actually enhances the feel of the story. I was not bored for one second and I have watched this so many times since it came out. A masterpiece.",

Thus, The Social Network creates itself not as piece of real-life information feeding (like so many of the bland biopics we see today), but as a case that uses real life to create something that is a brilliant work of art.

Well, its a story that 1,000,000,000 people (or users) can relate to, it has skillful direction by Fincher to get across the said story, a screenplay by Sorkin that seems to roll of the actors tongues, and overall a use of editing that is rarely present in modern day films. So, does all of that answer their question?",

Whilst the film has been criticised for toying with the facts for theatrical purposes, it is clear that what Fincher sees as the order of events leading to Facebook's inception tell an enthralling tale of greed, betrayal and friendship. Jesse Eisenburg and Andrew Garfield both give incredible performances that anchor the movie; you can take a real interest in these character's lives. Where TSN succeeds is in its dialogue, which was conceived by the brilliant mind of Andy Sorkin. It is fast paced, with every sentence leading to a new revelation, giving another direction for the story to be taken in. Enough is revealed throughout the film to engage you, however it is only in the last 20 minutes of the film where the emotional impact of the film's morals begin to resonate. I won't spoil it, but I will say that the ending leaves you wondering what really matters to us as a society. The best film depicting our technological generation and a modern marvel.",

Basically, there is no way to describe the perfection of Aaron Sorkin's writing. So modern, real, powerful, fresh, smart.....it truly is an outstanding script with each line and phrase packing such a touching feel to it. I also love the way it shows of the culture and society's impact on our  language. It's a great depiction of the times we live in.

The movie is filmed beautifully and despite a generally young cast it manages to impress. Andrew Garfield was the character that impressed me the most from the crew because it seems like Jesse Eisenberg is playing the sarcastic nerd that he has played in Zombieland and Now You See Me. There is a lot of conflict in the film that I was completely unaware of before watching it, although it seems as though it may have been somewhat fabricated as some of the portrayed people have said. There is also a lot of points in the film where you feel that the cast are talking over you with computer and business language, but I was able to put that aside and generally enjoy the film.",

The film, which is a joint product of respected director David Fincher and equally respected screenwriter Aaron Sorkin, accomplishes its multiple goals: create a gallery of fascinating, fully realized characters; chronicle key events in the development and growth of today's most influential social networking site, Facebook; and explore the blurred lines that exist in the amorphous on-line environment where concepts like intellectual property are involved. The Social Network is rich with food for thought but the reason it captures the viewer's interest for more than two hours is because its story of friendship and betrayal is as old as traditional society and is presented with tremendous skill.

Aaron Sorkin and David Fincher do an amazing job of turning a fairly uneventful real story into an incredible drama. The soundtrack is phenomenal, creating a darkness and tension overlaid with sadness. One of my favorite aspects of the movie is that it creates essentially no \"likeable\" characters in the traditional sense. All of them are either arrogant, or self absorbed, or simply rude. Even Eduardo, who is perhaps the most redeemable character in the film, acts childish at times and is overly cruel to Mark. This element of the film reflects real life, especially in an environment like Harvard, where everyone is brilliant but kindness is harder to come by.  Everyone in the film is flawed, creating a movie where you aren't allowed to simply be distracted by a charming and lovable character, and instead must focus on the writing, the direction, and the acting, all of which are top of the line. This is one of my favorite movies of all time, and I think it will remain that way for a long time.",
