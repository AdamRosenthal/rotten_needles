Cameron Diaz is essentially the lead character in the film but Leslie Mann carries the film from a humor standpoint. Her nonsensical style is a delight and never gets boring or aggravating. Diaz's character has the bulk of the depth and she delivers as needed while Kate Upton provides the stereotypical ditzy blonde with big boobs but does so while maintaining a sort of sweet and innocently stupid charisma. Honestly, my only real negatives with the film were the decision to cast Nicki Minaj as a sort of comedic relief character and the underutilization of Upton's character. Minaj annoys you every brief moment she's on screen and Upton often times feels out of place; almost as if she was thrown on screen simply as eye candy, even though the film's target audience is women. Nonetheless, this is a surprisingly great movie that most women (and I think plenty of men) will enjoy.",
