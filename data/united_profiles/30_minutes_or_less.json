Reminds me of what Benicio did for The Usual Suspects.  His speaking style made me roar.  I think he needs his own comedy vehicle sometime soon.  And sure, Aziz is funny, his on-screen sister from Greek is solid (and should get more roles), but I'm getting a little tired of seeing Eisenberg.  Lastly, it seems like Danny McBride - while funny - is essentially playing Kenny Freakin' Powers in every role.  He needs to mix it up soon lest he wear out his welcome.",

Obviously, a movie about a pizza guy trying to rob a bank with a bomb strapped to his chest isn't supposed to be realistic, so that didn't bother me. No, the problem is Danny McBride. His character goes from irritating to seriously obnoxious by the end of the film. The first half an hour is all pretty gross and not all that funny, but stick with it and the movie gets to be very enjoyable. The Eisenburg/Anzari combo makes this movie, and once the bomb is on, it's a hilarious and fun blast to the finish.",

      "text": "30 Minutes or Less is the last of the Summer of R Rated comedies and while it didn't live up to the promise of its excellent cast and cool premise it did manage to get out some genuine laughs even with all of the overly crude humor thanks mainly to Aziz Ansari's well done performance and some great chemistry between some of the actors. 30 Minutes or Less is based on a true story of a pizza delivery guy who had a bomb strapped to him to make him rob a bank. That is literally the plot of this movie. The plot lost what made it so fun halfway through which made the movie feel disjointed and the measly 83 minute run time could've easily been boasted had they decided to follow up on their character development or extended a short bank robbery scene which the movie had been building up to but we never saw enough of it. The biggest bright spot out of the bunch was Aziz Ansari, who played Nick's (Jesse Eisenberg) best friend. Ansari delivered his lines with comedic poise and fit the role well. Danny McBride and Nick Swardson's roles were held down thanks to overly crude writing and a lack of any creativity. In terms of how good it stacked up against other comedies from the Summer, it certainly is a let down. Horrible Bosses was a much greater and clever comedy and didn't rely on crude d*** jokes.",

Danny McBride and Aziz Ansari are two of my least favorite actors in Hollywood, so why would I watch this movie? The trailer looked hilarious and that's really the point of trailers isn't it, to get you to watch a film you wouldn't otherwise be interested in. The story follows Dwayne, a spoiled rich kid who won't grow up. Dwayne and his buddy Travis hatch a drunken plan, to off Dwayne's father for the insurance money, using a pizza boy as a pawn in a murder for hire scheme. The pizza boys job is simple, rob a bank or the bomb they've strapped to his chest explodes. The clock is running out for pizza boy Nick, along with his best friend Chet, they have to come up with a plan before they're blown to bits. With this cast and the same Writer/Director as Zombieland, I was expecting all the funny parts to be in the trailer, but I was pleasantly surprised. That Facebook kid, Jesse Eisenberg stars and is actually pretty funny, he always reminds me of Michael Cera, only less lanky and gay. His Co-star is Danny McBride, who is my top 10 list of least favorite actors. It's not that he's a bad actor, but he's just so over the top with everything he does, that it destroys anything that could have been funny. Surprisingly, McBride is pretty toned down in this film and for once you could actually see that he can be very funny in the right circumstances. The story wasn't bad, but it isn't as unique as you might think. About 20 years ago this actually happened and in that case the pizza boy was killed, so turning it into a comedy may not have been the most sensitive thing to do. As for the film, it was a lot funnier than I was expecting and the cast actually had some really good chemistry. It's not the funniest film you'll ever see, but it's certainly a good way to kill a couple of hours.",
