The interesting thing here is that this girl is discovering the world, learning how to survive. But she is frightened of the unknown things, which are for example living independently, detachment from the family, own survival, civilized humans, melting icecaps and storms; all these things are represented as strange and fantastic creatures that chase the protagonist. The problem is that Hushpuppy insists on trying to hold on the things she had sometime, that is why she is a mess without her father or likes to talk to a shirt pretending to be her absent mother. Another exciting topic is that the only thing that the protagonist knows for sure is that everything fits perfectly in the universe and has a natural course, so one change should lead to another. This turns out to be a very surprising movie and Quvenzhane Wallis did a dazzling performance, very uncommon for a girl of that age.",

Hushpuppy's voiceover reveals the island folk rarely need an excuse to have a party or take another holiday.  If this film were shot through the more perceptive eyes of an adult, the audience I bet would get a much different take on things.  Extreme poverty, alcoholism, and child neglect are just the first few overt issues which come to mind.  It was a very wise move for the filmmakers to stick with the child protagonist.

There is a lot to engage you and ponder after, and in that regard I think this is a film that I will revisit and talk about many years down the road. I was surprised at how little of the fantasy that I have heard so much about made up very little of this film. I do think this is probably a good thing, this movie at its heart is about poverty. It paints a very painful picture of the people who live in this area called The Bathtub. There are many layers to both the characters in this film and their story arcs. I believe the performances to a person were solid if not spectacular. I am reluctant to say that this film looks amazing, because the world that the director builds is so dreary and depressing. However he conveys this perfectly and to me that means this film looks amazing. As with a lot of movies it seems that in the last half hour the director is unsure of how to end his story, so some things end up going on that may make you shrug a bit. The scene with our protagonist on a boat is probably my favorite in the entire film and since this is very close to the end I think the story did a decent job of giving us something to hold on to. This is a must see and it will be interesting to see where this film maker goes from here.",

Many viewers may not get past a feeling that the child, Hushpuppy, needs her life to be upgraded, that she lives in unacceptable conditions. The film emphasizes her adaptability and capacity for learning hard and simple truths about the nature of life on earth as she is living in a setting that does not shield children in all the ways we \"civilized\" people have come to expect. There is harshness from her father, for example, and yet his intense love for her is also apparent along with his desire that she be strong enough to deal with the realities of their life. \"Everybody loses the thing that made them.

Through her journey, she learns, from her friends, family, and nature, how to take care of herself, and eventually become \"King of the Bathtub.\" The movie seamlessly and effortlessly delivers strong liberal messages about devastation, poverty, alcoholism, etc. But more importantly, the film introduces a new kind of heroine in live-action film: the small but strong female independent heroine, played astoundingly flawlessly by Wallis. The cinematography is beautiful and moving, the symbolism is pitch-perfect and never layered in excess (although may become confusing and redundant to the point of being unnecessary over time), the film never lags, and the score is remarkably beautiful, becoming one with the film (something that very rarely happens in small-budget films).

The story of a \"true loving  community\". What I saw was an attempt to portray abject and total squalor as heroic. A community of total drunks and mental misfits holding out against what?... adequate food, a dry roof, and medical care? The line between real and fantasy is blurred in this movie, but it appears to show the girl and her child friends, eating shrimp and crabs thrown onto the floor as they grovel in the spent shellfish shells. I wanted to cheer for her anti-establishment living arrangment, but opted instead to call DFACS. There are a few poetic scenes- the girl romping through the meadow, the girl holding up to her ear living things to apparently hear what they are saying... I have always been a died in the wool anti-establishment type, and I appreciate the idea of alternative communities...but these people lived like pigs.  There is nothing heroic, nor worth protecting about their lifestyle. If you relish the idea of a drunk, mental father, dying of some un-named disease, mentoring his 6 year old daughter to survive alone after his passing, by instilling in her the idea that she is strong and fearless, while living in a tideland, in a hovel made out of scraps  of sheet metal, then you will love this movie.

The tumultuous relationship between Hushpuppy and her father Wink was extremely well executed, thanks to Quvenzhan\u00e9 Wallis and Dwight Henry's soulful performances. I found, first timer, Ben Zeitlin's manipulative direction to be quite effective in this emotional journey. Part of me wished the fantastical elements were much more heightened and the film itself wasn't such a downer; but any movie that's able hit someone on such an emotional level deserves much praise. It's also technically good; the deft sounds and pulses of nature are well mixed; and Zeitlin's (along with Dan Romer) score was quite an accomplishment.

We watch a lot of mainstream films everyday which are made by the people who we know so well, but it's surprising and inspirational at the same time, how unknown or very little known people can do something so big that it gets them all the recognition they deserve. First of all, Quvenzhan\u00e9 Wallis' performance is outstanding which becomes very clear from the fact that she has already won so many critics awards, she has a huge career waiting for her in the future. Her character Hushpuppy is a 6-year-old girl who lives with her father in a cut-off community called 'The Bathtub\". Throughout the film, she learns how to take care of herself and people around her, how to be strong and what to do in difficult situations. Moving on to the plot of the film and the main storyline, it discusses a lot of topics such as poverty, survival, one's own imagination and most importantly family. Hats off to Zeitlin and Lucy Alibar (co-writer) for their strong vision and making it possible. This is Zeitlin's directional debut and the odds are in his favour this year, he has been getting a lot of appreciation lately. The film does not offer any shocking scenarios, but what it does is quite breathtaking especially the climax where Hushpuppy confronts the Aurochs which is wonderful and I can't get enough of it. Despite the fact that this is a slow-paced film, it is equally excellent and unique, I have never seen something so beautiful and well-crafted like this before.",

This movie can't be classified beneath any mere genre, for it transcends them all and can only be described as a breathtaking work of art. I have seen it three times now (admittedly, it did not 'click' cohesively upon the first viewing) and I can proudly say that it is one of the best films of the year, if not one of the best of all time. The movie really captured me in the way it balanced realistic drama with fantasy elements, as if it were seen through the eyes of a child. The set design (apparently constructed by members of the cast and crew) appears thoroughly lived in and the visuals, while not dominating the narrative, are beautiful and seamless considering the budget constraints of independent features. The actors (all untrained and cast locally) capture a sense of community in this world known as 'The Bathtub' which takes the abstract elements of the movie and make them feel real. This film also marks the arrival of some very promising new talent. Never in my memory has the debut of any director been so ambitious, and equal parts fulfillled, as 'Beasts of the Southern Wild', crafted out of love by director Benh Zeitlin. His voice is a secular one, distinctive, yet clear in delivery and always well-intentioned. He wants nothing else than to envelop us in the medium of film as far as we can go and move us. And I can't leave out the fiery performance by young Quvenzhane Wallis. She is the burning life of this movie, portrayed so realistically that it is damn near unbelievable. I still can't wrap my mind around the fact that she was only six years old upon filming. Wow. To describe it in comparison to other films, it is like a blend of Terrence Malick's 'The Tree of Life' and Hayao Miyazaki's 'Ponyo', with trace elements of 'Winter's Bone' and 'Precious' (both past Grand Jury Prize winners). Well, I can't really describe it any further without becoming redundant so I'll leave it at this: 'Beasts of the Southern Wild' is a magical, funny, and at times deeply moving experience that should be given the chance to challenge and inspire you.",

I don't want to spoil, but as you'll learn -- that's not even close.  The director does this (I believe) to avoid the dated liberal notion of angelic black folk in cinema -- a painful art house cliche.  The movie must make a baker's dozen of such surprise choices -- including the lead's mother in spades.",

The film also features some intriguing imagery and symbolism, but those things combined didn't come together as I was led to believe. The film was not emotionally resonant at all (in my opinion). An ambitious directorial debut from Benh Zeitlin, but I do not understand the Oscar nominations (at all). I wasn't impressed by Quvenzhane Wallis's performance.",

I wouldn't say it's Oscar worthy, but it's a good Sunday afternoon by yourself film. The reason critics love it is because, unlike us, they know how to evaluate the definitive work. By the way, some of the negative reviews here are too defensive to be trusted. Some are like, \"OMG, they are saying poverty stricken, addicted people are...human too. How dare they suggest that anything other than my white middle class/mainstream lifestyle leads to enlightenment!\" Really?

To begin with we see that the stage is set on a poor and peasant village, where a little kid lives with her father, in the most precarious conditions. The interesting thing here is that this girl is discovering the world, learning how to survive. But she is frightened of the unknown things, which are for example living independently, detachment from the family, own survival, civilized humans, melting icecaps and storms; all these things are represented as strange and fantastic creatures that chase the protagonist. The problem is that Hushpuppy insists on trying to hold on the things she had sometime, that is why she is a mess without her father or likes to talk to a shirt pretending to be her absent mother. Another exciting topic is that the only thing that the protagonist knows for sure is that everything fits perfectly in the universe and has a natural course, so one change should lead to another. This turns out to be a very surprising movie and Quvenzhane Wallis did a dazzling performance, very uncommon for a girl of that age.",
