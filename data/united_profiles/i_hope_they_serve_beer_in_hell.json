There was some funny dialog but the movie really serves an important educational purpose.Except when he unrealistically  \"sees the light\" at the end  It almost perfectly displays someone with Narcissistic Personality Disorder. In real life the guy would just continue on and never believe he has a problem. Czuchry's charachter is charming, entitled, selfish, manipulative, deceptive, does not accept responsibility, is unnaccountable, blames others and is shameless. Toss in a bit of a sociopathic personality and that is him. I lived with a classic narcissist for 4 years and can tell you this film felt like a bad reunion. In a movie in can be entertaining as \"bad\" charachters are interesting and even quite funny. In real life it is hell even with beer. I highly recommend this movie if you are trying to get someone to understand what this personality disorder can look like in day to day life.",
