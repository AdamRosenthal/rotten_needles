The budget could not have cost more than 1,000.00 dollars and that includes paying the actors, if you want to call them that. I went with my 2 daughters, 15 and 18. My 18 year old almost threw up because of the 3 year old filming the scenes as well as me being nauseated. The camera keeps jerking around and can hardly make sence of any of the movie. My 15 year old is such a wuss that a fart will scare her if you do not tell her first that you're going to fart and she disliked the movie also. I would not leave the movie theatre till I got 3 free movie passes. And that was only because I would not leave and the manager wanted to go home. Almost got arrested because I would not leave till I got free movie passes. There is not even an ending. It just looked like the 3 year old filming pressed stop to go get his diaper changed and take a nap and forgot to film the ending. Do not go and see this low budget piece of sh*t movie. They should stop making these movies all together as none of them are worth a pile of dung.

There are even a few laughs (when the gang members enter the witch ranch house in the end with a scatter gun and Mac 10).  I like the shift to Oxnard and the Mexican community, and I appreciate the new story (women are marked by witches and then killed after giving birth so that their first-born sons can form some sort of future army...) but when the guy walks into the wardrobe at the ranch and winds up on the first floor of the house owned by the couple from the first films, it loses a lot of credibility with me. Sure, the ranch house looks a lot like the house the babysitter runs to at the end of part IV, but how the hell does this dude get teleported to that San Diego house?  Bizarre and a bit of a cheat in my book.",

Explaining that Kristi and her family's story,  while pivotal, is not isolated,  but in fact part of a bigger plot effecting many people. One of the more interesting points of the marked ones was with the peripheral character Oscar. He,  in a daze of clinging to the last of his humanity, tells the main character that they have both been marked,  that \"she put it in me...  Like she put it in you.\"  and most unsettlingly goes on to explain that \"the only way to stop it is to kill yourself... Kill yourself before you hurt somebody you care about.\"  which is what he proceeds to do himself. The way that Oscar's story was attached to the root plot of the marked ones I don't doubt seeing the rest of his story told in another movie from the beginning, upto his showdown with Anna, and most disturbing, what horrible things he must have done between killing her and killing himself,  to make him give Jesse such a horrifyingly accurate warning of where their common possessions would lead if unchecked. I have always said that the paranormal activity movies offer much more individually as contributions to a very unique,  original, and ambitious saga than they do as stand alone projects.

This film ditches the highly cliche night after night camera setup in the living room and bedrooms- style, and instead focuses on the characters themselves and the actions they take in response to the paranormal events that occur around them. The cast primarily consists of Latino actors and actresses, and they manage to pull off pretty decent (and often times humorous) performances. While the scares aren't original by any means, more tension than I could 've ever imagined is built up in the final twenty minutes or so! As with the fourth film's ending, this film's ending not only scared the living hell out of me, but also surprised the living hell out of me and completely caught me off guard!!! Those who had questions left unanswered in any of the previous installments (yes, even the first film) will hopefully be satisfied with this film's ending, as it certainly solved several questions, but also left several new ones unanswered that will hopefully be answered in the upcoming official fifth film (this is a spinoff, mind you.) So overall, definitely a very fresh entry into a slowly dying franchise.

As time has gone on, the film-making appeared to be less important, the story more confusing and convoluted and with the best will in the world, it seemed like the audience was the last consideration of a juggernaut that relied on them, yet didn't really care enough about them to offer what they thought they'd paid for.",

This is a spin-off from the main series, so it doesn't have much to do with Katie, Hunter, or the other characters other than expanding the more vague aspects of the mythology. The Marked Ones does have a decently interesting story with an ending that kinda aggravated me, and there is a bit more action in this film than the other four installments, but I felt like it was missing something. The movie was filled with a lot more jump scares than the rest of the series, most failed and only some warranted a slight jump, and there was no suspense or real fear throughout this movie. This focused more on the action and humor rather than any scares, which wouldn't be a problem for most horror movies, but when I see a Paranormal Activity movie, I don't expect to see some guy draw a dick on another guy's face. It has some mildly scary scenes, and the change of setting does give a bit more variety to the series, but The Marked Ones mostly fails to live up to the impossibly high standards set by the franchise by being a by-the-numbers found footage flick.",

The one thing that at least kinda saved the movie was when he goes to this house and teleports him to one certain place that was in 1 and 3 but it also sinks the franchise PA-GD better be good or this franchise needs to end",

It was like watching candid vid clips of ordinary peoples through daily humdrum affairs. Your basic dares, shenanigans, and trivial banter permeate the screen. I had to keep reminding myself to be patient and that this is a paranormal \u201chorror\u201d film. The paranormal finally kicks in on the film, at first having more similarities to \u201cChronicles\u201d than evil spirits, utilizing the standard special effects tricks, however it soon gets into the normal groove of paranormal. The story is a strong concept that just seems to get cluttered with half hearted direction. One cool thing about the film was the cast\u2019s ability to make the drama, banter and interaction on screen seem genuine. The dialog maintain a constant fluidity from start to finish. There is a mild sense of inability to sell the paranormal fright from a couple of the actors when the crap hits the fan but it is minimal and soon the cast is back in sync.",

This film is a defining example of what it means to milk a concept, imdb said it had an estimated $5m budget, but honestly I doubt any of that went into the film.  Go watch a indie horror film, or indie drama, they'll both be better than this nonsense. Dare I say, Dragonball: Evolution would be a better time spent than watching this. :O",
