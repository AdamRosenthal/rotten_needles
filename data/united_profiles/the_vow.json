It has the feel of a documentary: no silly plot devices, no wild plot twists, no unbelievably strange or hateful characters.  Even Paige's (Rachel McAdams) father turns out not to be the skunk that I kind of expected him to be. This was a well-made, simply told movie.  Channing Tatum impressed me.  I have seen him as a dancer, as a roman legionnaire, and now as a romantic lead, and Angels, that boy does it all! And I'm telling you, if I could wear a hat like he does - in the movie- and smile mischievously-like he does in the movie-my sweetheart would never leave me. He is a boy, and I like girls, but he is tasty! And Rachel is very sweet.  Angels, they both act beautifully. Honestly, their body language and facial expressions were spot on. They were not acting; this is what was actually happening to them. My honey and I had a good time!  So why only an 8?  Well, the main weakness I think is that the plot did not match the title.  My honey made this point, I disagreed with her, but,  on reflection, she is right. The film is called 'The VOW'. A VOW is a declaration of super commitment-'To make this happen, I will move heaven and earth, and I will never give up.'  But Angels he didn't move heaven and earth. He gave up.  Look, he acted perfectly reasonably.  He was up against a lot of difficulties. Realistically, things looked hopeless. But he had made a VOW, and he did not keep it....",

There have got to be 1000 such stories with \"smarter\" people involved or better endings. The fact that this movie was based on one with a moronic character and a mediocre ending shows just how masochist viewers are. The movie is slow, not emotional enough given the subject matter, and just in general not all that good. The only emotional part of the movie was the scene with Paige interacting with her mom near the end of the movie.

It was an inspirational film, touching and cute.  However, it was lacking a strong core, a center to define pure love which is ever present in the real life couple's story that this movie was based on.  We do catch a glimpse of this in another couple's relationship in the movie, which only has survived against all odds.  However, the biggest upset of this film is that it doesn't even hold true to it's title.  If it had, it would have been a breath of fresh air in comparison to all the typical Hollywood adaptations of juvenile fantasy that is sold under the name \"romance\"; those culminations of high school daydreams that are ever predictable and unrealistic.  Don't get me wrong.  The Vow was okay, but it could have been ten times better if Hollywood hadn't dumbed it down to make it 'Hollywood' correct.  Sometimes the center of a story, however controversial it may be, just can't be replaced, especially by adequate actors and good cinematography.",

Interestingly enough, it is Tatum here who gives the better performance. In fact, he's really improved in recent.
