I really wish that the creators would've did better justice to the remake of this film. It is a classic and one of my favorites. I wasn't moved by the remake as I was with the original version.  The costumes during there performances, was off. Whitney Houston's portrayal as the mother was totally different from the mother's character in the original.  These were two totally different movies.  I actually went to youtube and watched the original and it moved me to tears, unlike the remake.  I really would like to see someone re-do this film again, and give it justice.  Not a good re-make of this timeless piece.  It needs to be redone, stick to the original mold and upgrade.
