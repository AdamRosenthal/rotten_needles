      "text": "\"Beverly Hills Chihuahua\" in October of 2008, \"Marley & Me\" on Christmas 2008, and now \"Hotel for Dogs\" in January of 2009. THREE FILMS centered around dogs in roughly THREE MONTHS. Cleary, the fact that this many films centered around dogs were released in such a short time (after only 2 dog-centric films entered wide-release in ALL of 2007) shows that Hollywood was having some crazy obsession with canine companions. And hey, I love dogs a lot, but just because a film has dogs, doesn't mean it will automatically be good, and that rings true for \"Hotel for Dogs.\" The film is far better than most of Nickelodeon Movies' live-action efforts, and it's safe, harmless, family-friendly fun overall, but by-and-large, it's just too run-of-the-mill to really break out a lot. I can't really say that it's good OR bad, though, it's merely okay. If you have kids, they might get a good laugh out of it, but if you're an adult, you might not enjoy the film nearly as much.",
