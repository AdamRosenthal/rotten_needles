Like Tarantino, Blomkamp is demanding engagement from the viewer, and when one is able to shunt disbelief aside and enter his world, the brilliance of his vision and his technical ability in portraying it make it an emotionally and intellectually satisfying experience. This is Asimov meets Orwell, it shows a depth of understanding of the nature and evolution of technology as well as the essential structures that produce it that should make most political scientists feel ashamed. Blomkamp isn't producing 'summer block buster entertainment' for the American masses, he's trying to create something artistic. This is not Lady Gaga, it's the White Stripes. A lot of critics will miss the joy of this movie by trying to watch it in terms of a summer blockbuster, instead of being aware that this is a director who will never (at least we hope) produce anything that Hollywood wants him to make. Blomkamp heavily references the scientific types found in novels like Dune and gives them a feeling of reality that is almost creepily grounded in today. A lot of critics ask questions like \"how did people end up on Elysium\". Well how have rich people in any time period distanced themselves from the masses? The answer is slowly. This is a film that will ultimately be beyond people who have never seen or noted how extreme income disparities develop and who have no feeling for how political economy works thorough technology. As such, many critics will try to cast it as a parody or satire of today's world, but in doing so will miss the point completely. This is the world of today taken to its logical end. Solid acting by Matt Damon who plays the everyman with a sort of pent up aggression that's important to the role. Jodie Foster's role is delightful, but ultimately, if a movie is defined by the quality of its villain, Foster is an antagonist but not the ultimate evil. That's reserved for Sharlito Copley, who's portrayal of Agent M Kruger brings chills, all the more so because his type of existence and the nature of his evil are so well recorded in history. But you'd have to know some history to know that and so we come back to the point; Elysium is an intelligent film for intelligent people, and many critics will bash it simply because they don't get it. I certainly don't expect the editor of Time Out London to do so. Frankly, I hope Blomkamp simply ignores them and that we continue to see the evolution of this fascinating artist.",

While Damon is the best part of the movie (he was GREAT), there just wasn't enough Elysium life-style development (I was curious as to the details of how the habitat worked and what they did, but nothing was ever shown except for women lying by pools with their butler robots).  The only part of Elysium that was developed was the defense side, in which Jodi Foster was miscast, IMO.  She is a great actress but her in this role didn't feel right to me.  By the same token, not much was devoted to life on earth and how society operated in the future there either.  Lots of people running around looking poor, sick and dirty, but nothing much about how they survived.  TONS of action though, so I am guessing the guys will like this movie a lot.  But for me, it left too much out in favor of all the action.",

I wouldn't have minded the similarities but it was too close.  Then we go to Matt Damon, a character who I couldn't begin to care about.  The attempts at reliving moments of his childhood are completely useless.  The woman he once loved has a child and continues to now, clearly did not think about him as much as he did her.  You'd think it would pull at a soft spot but instead that gets in the way.  When Damon sees the child he tells her he wont save her (guess what happens at the end, a change of heart!)  The change of heart was not as thought provoking or intense as in District 9.  Where you started out hating the character but really begin to root for Wikus.  I never had that in Elysium, he was all about saving himself until the last moments of the movie.  But when Max died I felt nothing.

The problem is that Elysium lacks any of the features and story that made District 9 so fantastic. When released convict Max (Matt Damon) is irradiated at work he sets out on a journey to travel to Elysium, a high tech space station made to house the rich and famous while the poor and helpless live on a ruined Earth. To get up to Elysium to find a cure Max must face the brutal defence secretary Delacourt (Jodie Foster) and her pitbull agent Kruger (Sharlto Copley). While it does show the inventive and socially dynamic mode of storytelling Blomkamp thrived at with District 9, Elysium doesn't tread as lightly as its predecessor as it plays the 1% card over and over. Blomkamp's attempts to humanise his characters through cliched relationships and convenient bonding moments that feel fake and uninvolving backfires. The action heavy plot is clever and should be a science fiction fans dream plot but when the action actually breaks out the fighting is so frenetic thanks to an overeager editor that all the action becomes blurry and hard to watch. Damon is good but is straddled with a crop of bad performers bringing the proceedings down. Most notably is Jodie Foster who phones it in as a manipulative bureaucrat with her eyes on, surprisingly, more power. Foster always mounts the fence when it comes to overacting but here she leaps over it in a single bound. Copley's villain is a treat and he really is horrible making him shine with an odd sense of wonder but its not enough to fill in the films many plot holes and problems meaning Elysium was not paradise at all.",

      "text": "You know the writers got the class warfare aspect of this movie across perfectly when you almost smile at the thought of Homeland Security's pet sociopathic murdering rapist rampaging through the space station where all the elite snobs hang out.  Yes, at one point they did use the words Homeland Security, in case somehow someone failed to get that Elysium represents America (or at least America's ruling elite) and impoverished Earth represents the rest of the world.  I'm all for a movie that captures the anger and frustration of have-nots gazing upon the intolerably selfish haves.  However, I prefer my class warfare with fewer plot holes.  First there is the usual problem of humans  going to work building robots that are fully sophisticated enough to build themselves.  Then factory worker and hard-bitten hero Max receives a lethal dose of radiation without becoming lethal to everyone around him.  As an aside, poor Max!  His troubles start with a beating from jackboot robots, which leads to the extension of his parole by his robot parole officer, and then goes from there to radiation poisoning.  Then things get really bad for him.  Now back to the plot holes, because there are many more.  First of all, I don't recall any reason the citizens of Elysium need the pitifully impoverished, desperately sick and injured people of Earth.  The people of Elysium are terrified of illegal immigrants invading their space station paradise, and since they are more than ruthless enough to deny the people of Earth assistance of any kind I see no reason why they wouldn't have dropped a few neutron bombs on the planet and been done with the problem long ago.  Instead it seems they're hoarding all the immortality for themselves while panicking when the occasional illegal reaches the station, breaks into a house, and obtains medical treatment.  The illegals reach Elysium thanks to a thriving black market in identification and disposable shuttles.  Very disposable.  The Irish coffin ships had better odds of making it to shore.  This operation is run by a guy who can't get his henchmen to abduct a citizen of Elysium and steal passcodes out of his head, so he gets Max to do it in exchange for a ticket to Elysium to cure the radiation poisoning that will kill him in five days.  The citizen Max decides to abduct is for some unclear reason slumming around on Earth heading up the robot manufacturing plant where Max, thanks to glaring worker safety issues, gets his lethal dose of radiation.  During the course of this we end up doing a stint in Johnny Mnemonic, with Max's head containing the secret to Elysium citizenship for all.  It seems that all anyone has to do to make everyone on Earth a citizen of Elysium is type in the command and reboot once Max's brain gives up the data (killing Max in the process).  Because any advanced society is just one hack away from being completely and irretrievably taken over.  Then to compound that plot hole, the movie ends with the now benevolent Elysium computer sending medical help to all of its new citizens on Earth.  If that was so easy then why didn't Elysium's government just do it in the first place and spare themselves the trouble of arguing with their sadistic Homeland Security head over whether to shoot the desperate immigrants out of the sky or just stomp them and send them back to Earth?  So why did I give this movie such a high score?  Because sometimes the theme and overall flavor of a story works even when the plot is swiss cheese.",

Speaking of District 9, there were lots of little threads from this film to that one. Love the horned beasts on the military vehicle and uniforms in both films. There are awesome guns and various types of big, wet, full body explosions via various guns, guns which bear a resemblance to all those great alien weapons deployed in D-9. All in all a very entertaining movie about technology and class warfare. Wish there had been a little more 1 percenter utopia in my 99 percenter dystopia.

The leading bad-guy, \u201cKruger\u201d, with his thick Afrikaner accent, is cast as an evil, violent relic of Apartheid. \"Kruger\" is of course an allusion to Paul Kruger, the father of the nationalist Afrikaner homeland that was eventually brought down by the British in 1902. Similar to the aims of the French FN party, Kruger\u2019s short-lived Transvaal Republic was established with the intent of preserving Afrikaans culture from invading British and native black cultures. Sadly, it failed. (As did eventually Apartheid, nearly 20 years ago- but apparently Apartheid can never really die in the minds of liberals such as Blomkamp, as they always need some kind of white racist whipping boy at their disposal on which to blame the world\u2019s ills, nevermind the profound failures and overt racism found in many black/minority run governments, especially South Africa.)",

      "text": "In the split universe that is Neill Blomkamp's summer action movie \"Elysium,\" the 'haves' live, quite literally, a world above the 'have-nots.' And what the 'haves' have, on their pain-free, protected ring-world space station, is an opulent lifestyle facilitated by jealously guarded technology. Aboard the titular space colony that is \"Elysium,\" bio-medical scanner/repairer tanning-beds confer near-immortality to the privileged. The security personnel can closely monitor Earthly activities almost anywhere. Humanoid robot police tightly control borders, restricting human movement. And corporate executives rocket about in dark window-tinted space shuttles with Bugatti-coachwork. This is luxury life in the year 2145. If these seem allegorical to present-day conflicts over universal health care, freedom of information, immigration policy and ubiquitous surveillance, you are not wrong. But writer-director Blomkamp didn't want a heavy social justice message to get in the way of the film's popcorn munch-inspiring action. Down on the rough and ruined planet, a good but flawed man, Max (Matt Damon) must find his way to the privileged orbiting citadel in order to save his own life. In the process he will save much more  and, paradoxically, lose much more. But first he must make it through badass Kruger, played by Sharlto Copley, who starred in Blomkamp\u2019s breakthrough film \"District 9.\" \"Elysium's\" Kruger is part Terminator, part \"Star Wars\" bounty hunter, and part ex-Special Forces-turned mercenary. Outrageous explosions, \"snarkily-spun\" sci-fi tropes, and bloody combat frequently punctuate this summer action picture. But the movie has a strong heart. There are subtle, surprisingly mature love stories: between mother and child; brothers in arms; a deep but platonic friendship. It's a tribute to the excellent cast that they are able to surface the love so that it reads so strong between all the flash-bangs, blood and breakneck chase scenes. \"Elysium\" is a cautionary tale about what happens if all the good gear winds up closely-held by the elites of society. Ironically, here in our real world, the clear trend has been toward technology as a widely self-proliferating and disruptively democratizing force. But sometimes, that doesn't happen without a fight: witness ObamaCare vs. the \"wealth-o-rati.\" And ubiquitous tech doesn't come without the possibility of abuses: witness United States' NSA over-reach, Facebook dossier-compilation and Google micro-targeting. In \"Elysium\" the fight gets personal. Its paradoxical plot hinges on a lethal, yet life-saving, software download, on the person (Max) who must carry it, and on the powerful woman who craves control of it: Jodie Foster, who portrays 'Delacourt', the 108 year-old protector of the privileged space-paradise, is  in real life  concerned about the current state of Earth's real citizens.  \"Elysium's\" subtle social justice relationship to Blomkamp's earlier social sci-fi movie \"District 9. Elysium's\" 22nd century tech is marvelous in the original sense of the word. Of course, it's inconsistent  if you have nanotechnology that heals people in seconds, you don't need big guns to kill them  but who cares? The shuttles are cool and only the nerdiest among us (me) will question their impossible propulsion. Blomkamp first-drafted \"Elysium\" as a sort-of graphic novel. It was a remarkably detailed roadmap for the film, right down to lead character Max's bulked-up, shaved-down, tattooed-all-around appearance. One gets the impression that Blomkamp might have started out to make a funnier, more satirical film, but realized the heart of the story lay in the darkness of human cruelty. The films R rating is deserved; there's a lot of blood and guns and fisticuffs and swearing of oaths. But \"Elysium's\" dystopian future is still a long ways off. Younger viewers have time to grow into seeing it and it\u2019s important that they do. This film will remain relevant for a long time to come.",

Frankly from what I see of the 99.9% I'd have dropped a virus on them, waited, then repopulated. However Jodi didn't get to be boss.",

The dual backgrounds of life on a decaying earth about 41 years in the future and the alternative safety and opulence enjoyed by the very rich on Elysium is so perfectly balanced that one is completely engrossed in the whole rather than being interested in only half the film. Matt Damon, following on from Bourne, continues to be a good investment as an action hero and Jodie Foster, with an intriguing accent, is fascinating as Elysium's gatekeeper. There are also some wonderful visual compositions and the special effects are sometimes stunning. On the evidence here one can understand why people would want to live on Elysium. The film remains on a constant level throughout due to rapid fire editing and music that adds volumes in creating the gamut of emotions that run through the film.

It's not as stylish or unique as District 9 either for a lot of it's running time, but it still manages to be entertaining, and its screenplay is also above most other action spectacles.  That being said, it does use too much heavy handedness in getting its obviously left sided political point out there.  Sharlito Copely proves again that he's a more than capable actor with his role of the crazy Kruger.  It's a role very far removed from District 9's Wikus, or The A team's Murdock, but he still manages to sell it.  Despite what many critics are saying about the last act, the action packed, stylish, and decently emotional finale is actually the best section of the film.  Overall, Elysium isn't able to stand beside Blomkamp's first film, or Inception or Avatar either for that matter, (The trio of great recent sci-fi films released within relatively short time from each other), but it may be the best film of the summer, and that's nothing to cry about.  It's also a strong contender for the visual effects Oscar.",

I will admit, Elysium has quite a few flaws, but they are something i can easily forgive as the movie makes up for its mistakes. First off i would like to mention that this film is absolutely gorgeous. Its one of the best looking films i have seen in quite some time. It just oozes style that reminds me of The Island mixed with Aliens. Combat is intense and filmed clearly so you can enjoy every moment. There are so many moments that just make you shout out in how insane they are. People get killed in some of the most over the top and violent ways you cant help but have a dark chuckle as at least half a dozen people are just turned into pink mist. POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILER, I will say that the knife fight at the end of the film is amazingly well done and a perfect way to have a fight with the main villain. END SPOILER As far as acting goes. I do think that the little girl was an awful actress yes but she has maybe three lines so it doesn't hurt the film, and Spyder's performance was so over the top that his ability to chew the scenery became freaking amazing. He overacted so much it just made his character seem likeably insane, sort of like Vass from Far Cry 3. Overall i loved this movie regardless of its flaws. I highly recommend this film for action and sci fi buffs. Just keep in mind that if you cant turn a blind eye to flaws and plot hole, you may enjoy this film less than i did.

So all the rich people have fled to the halo from the halo games and up there it's pretty much heaven. They have all These robot servants giving them everything and they have this medical bed where when someone lays on it and they are cured of all there problems. So that guy from sponge bob who had glass bones and paper skin would be right at home here, oh wait that was.. just... that rich guy..... oh. Well anyway, so one man named max (Matt Damon) is diseased with radiation during an accident on his job, so now he must put on this terminator suit and get up to Elysium and not just save his life but millions of people's lives on earth. Now the first thing I want to say about this movie are the actors and this casting was definitely great for this movie. First we have Matt Damon who was definitely a treat to have. I mean we have seen this guy kick ass in multiple other movies out there and it was no surprise that he did so in this movie. Then there was Jodie Foster who while not exactly stellar, she played her role as a  very well, granted I could think of other actresses who could play Elysiums secretary, but she did good. However those actors don't even compare to the man who stole the show and that was Sharlto Copley as crouger (or however u spell his name). Crouger was pretty much the bad guy in this movie and he was a psychotic one, when he was on that screen, i was just smiling and shaking the entire time. He is just so uncomfortable to be around and that's what makes him so effective. One of the many rules in movie making is that u can't have a great film without a great villain. I mean think about it some of the all time greatest movies have had great villains, Star Wars, the avengers, Indiana Jones the list goes on and on. I also really liked the message that this movie portrayed about are society today. Some might argue that it gets a little preachy, but I respectfully disagree. When movies have these kinds of messages about or world today, it really just makes your mind think and makes u feel more attached to the movie as a whole. Overall there aren't any glaring flaws I can point out in this movie. This is a phenomenally crafted sci-fi movie and one that is very emersive and surprisingly, was released in August of all months. And this movie made me shed some man tears at the end. Any movie that can do that deserves the 10/10 rating in my opinion.",

But, there were annoyances. Incomplete character development, plot holes, a predictable ending, and Sharlto Copely, all minor annoyances. Inconsistencies are where this movie fell apart a little bit. Sharlto Copely's character gets his face blown off and it gets rebuilt by the medical pod, and so why can't Matt Damon be saved from the uploading of that information?! I buy the machine that heals, but i don't buy a resurrection machine. But, with that aside, there are many things about this movie that I loved:  Matt Damon, Jodie Foster, the special effects, the production design, and the underlying message (which may have been too obvious). Overall, I think that if the script had gone through the writers room another time the issues that took me out of the movie would've been resolved; but the things i loved about it outweigh the bad and overall it was a great movie that had a few annoyances.",

However, the man who steels the show will go down as one of the greatest villains of all time...Shartlo Copely as Kruger. This guy was menacing, brutal, cold, and well just plain right uncomfortable.

When a movie's climax has your heart racing, it does something right.",

The acting is decent enough with an always great performance by Matt Damon and Sharlto Copely makes for a great villain, while others like Jodie Foster aren't utilized quite enough, she does a good enough job but she's upstaged by the previous actors. The visuals in this film are fantastic, even surpassing District 9 in that department, the best way I can describe the visuals is very hyper kinetic, its very fluid but always keeps the viewer in the action, especially in the fights between Damon and Copely.

      "text": "Four years of waiting and all I get is this? Bloomkamp is full of so many intriguing ideas and is full of great ideas for how to film them, but with his sophomore effort he seems to try to hard to include everything. Instead we get glimpses of cool ideas, hammered together in a quickly paced fashion that doesn't amount to much more than a less tactful version of District 9. The characters like the plot have the biggest issue and much the same one, yes it looks and acts cool, but once the film hits the third act, any semblance of depth is sheered away by bombastic plot holes and character inconsistencies. Examples, Kruger is fantastically played by Sharto Copley, a psycho who only wants to get paid to do what he loves (excess violence), he is on one track that's it, not pit stops for anything else. To bad that in the third act he drops this veneer of violence for fun and pronounce a desire for world domination which had never been even hinted at before. As for the plot, well lets just say that by the end of the film, the Elysium populace are made to seem like nothing more than dicks who don't want to share their toys. The ending makes no logical sense when put under any kind of scrutiny. My final criticism of the film is the camera work. Its cool at first but then it tries to get all experimental which instead of looking cool, draws your attention to the fact that you know they're trying to look cool and instead becomes a distraction and annoyance. This doesn't make the film terrible, it just makes it incredibly disappointing. Sophomore slump you say? No excuse, Duncan Jones made a follow up real quick and it was a solid thriller.  Bloomkamp needs to get back in the saddle, reign himself in and bring us the same glory that we got from D9. Stumble or no the film remains interesting to look at, this is the kind of film that will improve if they have an extended edition to explain some unanswered questions.",

      "text": "From the Writer/Director of District 9, comes Elysium, a futuristic tale that focuses on the inequality of wealth. Much like in his first film, Neill Blomkamp is examining a modern problem with a futuristic story, and once again, he isn't offering any solutions. As with District 9, Blomkamp is showing how an unsolved issue, left to it's own devices, will eventually cause chaos. In 2154, Earth is overpopulated and in ruins. The rich have built a utopian society on the largest space station ever conceived, and as you may have guessed, it's called Elysium. The story focuses on Max, an orphan and ex-con, who has always dreamed of living in paradise on Elysium. His plans to earn his way take a dramatic turn, when he is injured in an accident at work. Max knows he'll never survive on Earth and the only way to save his life is to get some of the advanced medical treatment available on Elysium. The two stories are very different, but the setting could have been exactly the same. The story itself was pretty good, there was a lot more action then in District 9, yet the similarities are unmistakable. Matt Damon stars and played the role he was asked to play. Max had a lot of potential to be an interesting character, perhaps one with an agenda, instead he was written as this dumb guy, who was anything but a savior to the people of Earth. Max was out to save himself and did what was necessary to survive, but he should have been more. The people all turned to Max to help solve a greater problem, but all he cared about was himself. Jodie Foster also stars, but has a surprisingly small role, that definitely did not fit her personality. Much like District 9 before it, the story of Elysium is used as a forum for the Writers agenda. The two stories are very different, but the technology, locations, and even several cast members are the same. The result is a slightly better movie than District 9, that will give you an eerie feeling of deja vu throughout.",

Starring Matt Damon, Jodie Foster, Sharlto Copley and Alice Braga, Elysium is actually a decent little Sci-Fi fantasy tale that carries solid performances, adequate action sequences, beautiful visuals, and a simple yet well executed premise. Now the real question is, as a whole, is Elysium overall a good movie? It most certainly is. It is definitely not fantastic, but it doesn't fall into the \"decent\" category nor go down under into being terrible. Matt Damon is adequate in the lead role, but SharIto Copley steals the show with his convincing portrayal of a psychopathic mercenary. Jodie Foster was above average but her character was the typical power-drunken politician that we've seen in film over and over. Elysium is a solid Sci-Fi click with great performances, great though 1-dimensional characters, an adequate and not-so-confusing storyline, exciting action sequences despite the occasional tiresome shaky cam and smooth pacing. If you're a Sci-Fi buff like I, I would definitely recommend giving Elysium a chance. In minor areas it is a bit rough around the edges, but through my opinion and perspective, it is overall an enjoyable addition to the beloved Sci-Fi genre.",

The concept of Elysium itself is just odd, if going into space and building colonies is easy why isn't there more of them. Also the going into space part seems as easy as driving down the street all they have to do is wait for the colony's defense grid to go down to make a heavenly run for the border. It's also maddening not to at least see how the rest of the world is fairing in this overpopulated mess. What about countries that are already overpopulated today such as China or India? Frankly showing us L.A. as a brown dirty stain on the California coast is nothing new and it would've been better to at least get a glance at the rest of the country.

Being written in bold strokes, very little was left to the imagination of the viewers. I literally felt beaten and bludgeoned by the free health care message which the film so obviously endorses, and that doesn't strike me as a tactfully written piece of work. The characters at the centre of the plot were one dimensional; and this became ever clearer in the films key dramatic moment, which truly fell flat. I call this a disservice to the talented Matt Damon, Jodie Foster and Sharlto Copley; who all gave substandard performances thanks to the substandard material they were given. I didn\u2019t completely dislike the film; the themes at work were great to digest, and the crew did fantastic work on the technical aspects of the movie.

It's no coincidence that whenever an illegal immigrant breaks into someone's house to use its medical facilities no one happens to be inside at that moment.

I'm sure you have guessed what the story may be as I did after a short amount of time into the film but to the films advantage it didn't play out as I had originally thought. The film starts off slowly as did District 9 letting you get to know world and characters but I felt some what bored with Matt Damon going around and doing his jobs. As soon as Sharlto Copley's character was introduced and the main plot of the film started to kick off it seemed very promising but it was still dry. I'm not sure if it's because it that all the things that made the film seem really cool is wasted and nothing really happens in the movie, it just stays at one level were as it should have been building to something greater.

Jodie foster feels rigid and uncomfortable in her role as Delacour, the film's few emotional scenes seem disjointed and out of the place, but worst of all is this film really doesn't have anything to say, with District 9 we were given a study of social class, a way those the lower classes are treated or how those who belong to a certain race are treated, it shows how people are blind to the way certain minorities are being treated until the become part of that minority, at best this film showed the gap between rich and poor, but that was only looked upon briefly before going on to the story of max, you could argue that the message at the end is \"never forget where you come from\" but that itself is a very cliched message, in conclusion this is a good action film but blomkamp fans or those expecting more will feel slightly disappointed with Elysium",

I missed it when it was in Cinemas and watched it recently when it popped up on Sky On Demand.... aaaannnd BOOOY was I surprised. I mean, there was exactly zero chance that I expected it to be as bad as it is. Now I realize that I'm either in the minority or the angry half, so let me give evidence and thus reason for my argument against this abominable waste of time.",

Elysium is a very good hard 'R' action movie packed with Mech suits, badass guns like the modded Ak-47 blowing apart robots with explosive bullets and the 'Chemrail' that literally tears apart it's target, when the villains face gets blown off by a grenade you get the idea that theres some good stuff in here. Matt Damon as the main character 'Max' is good but every time sharlto Copley shows up on screen as the villain 'Kruger', he completely chews the scenery along with a thick South African accent and an assortment of tricks (or bombs) up his sleeve to take down his targets. Neill Blomkamp shows once again that he can make a thrilling visual treat packed with all sorts of exciting stuff.",
