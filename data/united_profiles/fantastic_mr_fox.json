And this is a dying art to filmmaking, think about it it has been 3 years since another Wallace and Gromit film, and 2 years since a Stop Motion film has had a theatrical release, and thats why I think this is a dying art. I love all the details that are put into the characters, like how the fur on the puppets constantly moves throughout the scenes, plus the voice acting is really, really funny and entertaining. I didn't know who George Clooney was until this movie and im happy it introduced me to him, plus this movie i think has the biggest all star cast ever for a stop motion film, Bill Murray, Adrian Brody, George Clooney, Owen Wilson, even the small part characters have big actors.",

      "text": "Stop motion is a curious art. It never looks as real as CGI, and it's not as fluid as CGI. Also, it's extremely difficult to master. In fact, one would wonder why anyone would bother making a stop motion movie, as opposed to a CGI movie. The reason, is that stop motion has an odd, old fashioned, hand made feel to it. And somehow, that feel has been captured and placed into this movie, and it's not just evident in the animation. Fantastic Mr. Fox is inspired from Roald Dahl's picture book by the same name. The film follows the story of Mr. Fox, who starts stealing farmer's merchandise again, without telling his wife. Mr. Fox has been planning some \"great heist,\" despite his promises to his wife, claiming he would quit. Soon, the three meanest farmers of them all (Farmers Boggis, Bunce, and Bean), decide to end Mr. Fox's reign once and for all. The film's dry humor is both witty and hilarious. No movie in the world can stand up to the unique humor that Fantastic Mr. Fox displays. I give points to the outstanding voice talents (namely for George Clooney and Meryl Streep), and the comedic score by Alexandre Desplat. The animation is spectacular. By far the best I've seen in a stop motion film. It's truly fantastic. Even for stop motion, it looks incredibly good fashioned, and that is a very good thing. Unlike the book, however, this is not a piece of entertainment I can recommend for younger children. It's too dark, and they probably won't get many of the jokes (they may get a kick out of all the fuzzy animals, however). This is more of an older kids and parents flick. Fantastic Mr. Fox is fun, entertaining, unique, and visually wonderful. It is not hard to understand why they call it \"Fantastic\" Mr. Fox.",

      "text": "2009 was the year of childhood, wasn't it? Where Spike Jonze explores the honesty and emotions that go into childhood with \"Where the Wild Things Are,\" Wes Anderson decided to invoke nostalgia and memories in his adaptation of Roald Dahl's classic children's book \"Fantastic Mr. Fox.\" And while I hate making a pun involving the film's title, I can't lie, the movie really is \"Fantastic.\" The \"weird\" animation style works wonders for it, adding to its unique feel (and also looking beautiful to boot), the film is rather hilarious, well-written, fun, and it features some extremely memorable characters. Again, it's not for everyone, and some may find it a bit too \"arthouse,\" but \"Fantastic Mr. Fox\" is a brilliant animated feature that begs for repeat viewings.",

Everything he does is to serve this pathetic inner-child issue that it's simply nauseating. That aside, there's so much dialogue in the Fantastic Mr. Fox, with all of it amounting to nothing, that I was sad afterward that I saw it.",

      "text": "This gets my usual response to a well-made animated flick - it is cool to look at, but the story and characters are not very interesting.  I don't know why that is the case with so many of them, but it is.  The animation is gorgeous and seems to be a mix of stop motion and CGI.  And the script - eh - based on a Roald Dahl tale, it focuses on a crafty fox who raises the ire of some nasty farmers by stealing their chickens and cider.  This causes a backlash, and it becomes all out war between cute critters and creepy farmers.  For some reason, top actors like Clooney and Schwartzman were given the voice-over roles, which ends up being more distracting than effective.  The best of them was Wolodarsky as the shy, goofy possum.  The music choices were weird and took me out of the film.  A word about Wes Anderson - I know I'm supposed to like his slight, whimsical movies, but I don't.  The humor is bland and the stories are usually pointless.  Frankly, I don't get him, and I don't get why so many people like him.",
