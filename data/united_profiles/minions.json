      "text": "Minions is the prequel film that explains how the Minions came to be and how they met their master, Gru. Being a fan of the first 2 Despicable Me films, I was very hopeful that this would be good, but also very scared, because honestly, there's not enough substance to carry a whole film. Overall, it's not as good as the films before it, but it is still a nice addition to the franchise. I thought hearing just the minions for an hour and a half would get very tiresome, but they managed to make it work by adding human characters, while still keeping focus on the Minions. In this film we have an all-star cast that ranges from Sandra Bullock to Geoffrey Rush and Micheal Keaton. They all did a fine job at the rules they were given. I do have a few complaints with the film. It does seem to drag on a little bit but still manages to pick itself back up by the finale. A lot of the jokes were pointed towards kids, even more so than both Despicable Me, but the best jokes are the ones that kids may not get. There is a ton of references to 60's culture, and it's pretty cool to see something for the adults to enjoy.My biggest problem is that the story is really all over the place, It can't really stay focused on one thing for more than 10 minutes, and it gets a bit distracting. Overall, with a killer soundtrack and a ton of humor kids and adults will enjoy, even with the crumby story and a few flat jokes, Minions is still an enjoyable animated film, just not the best one this year.",

Also for the adult movie buffs in the audience there are plenty of references to other films one of which, if I\u2019m not mistaken, is a homage to \u2018The creature from the Black Lagoon\u2019? The villain here voiced by Sandra Bullock is the aptly titled Scarlet Overkill. However, the character lacks the sinister villainy of Despicable Me\u2019s \u2018Gru\u2019. I don\u2019t wish to be too harsh on the film because there are some truly inspired moments. The early narrated scenes depicting the Minions in search of the greatest villain they can find is a lot of fun as are the scenes at the Tower of London. Unfortunately, though, not being a true Minion convert I watched proceedings rather impassively laughing at only a couple of inspired sight gags.

But this film ticked most of the boxes needed for a good animation film. To start negatively, this film was rushed as f*ck. Honestly, scarlet overkill had just the worst build up to an antagonist I've ever seen in a movie. It was so quick and should've started with a little more context. Also, the action sequences were too rushed and should've had a more quick slapstick humour to them (i'm not saying they didn'y, but more would be nice). This being said, the comedy in this movie was exemplary as the minions are just too adorable in trying to understand a foreign world to them. The references to British pop culture in the 60's/70's were on point and added great comedic value to a film that means both children and adults will enjoy. Not the worst, but really not the best animated film out there.",

Most of the action is set in '60s London and the swinging period soundtrack adds upbeat nostalgic fun. While some of the gags are genuinely funny (and there are plenty of in-jokes for the grownups), the story wears thin and an endless energy makes up for true hilarity. Still, less discriminating younger viewers are bound to be delighted. NOTE: Stay thru the credits for a Beatles song featuring the entire cast.",

      "text": "If you've ever seen Despicable Me or its sequel, you will definitely remember the little yellow tic-tacs called the Minions. They stole the show in almost every scene they were in, and they were memorable and cute little sidekicks. However, too much of a good thing isn't necessarily a good thing, and the origin story for the Minions is the perfect example of that. Minions shows what those little bananas did before they met Gru as they journey to the International Supervillain Convention in 1968 and become henchmen to the world's most notorious villain, Scarlet Overkill. The issues with Minions are present from the very first scene and continue throughout the entire film. Much of the humor, as agonizing as this sounds, is supposed to come from the way the Minions talk. That wears out its welcome extremely quickly as you can imagine. Even the jokes that don't concern the Minions are reused numerous times throughout the film, making this movie tedious and repetitive. That could be somewhat forgiven if Minions had interesting characters or a compelling enough story, but unfortunately, this film has none of that. The Minions aren't exactly dramatic characters; they're always the sidekicks, destined to be overshadowed by the villains they serve. Even Scarlet Overkill is a fairly generic villain. She doesn't have any sort of special powers or a unique personality to distinguish herself from other power-hungry female villains. There's never any sort of drama or development with her character. Now onto the unfocused and rushed plot. If you have the attention span of a goldfish, you might find the plot of Minions to be fun, but anyone else will feel like they're being suffocated by the insanity of this film. This movie just never takes a break. There's never a moment where you can calm your senses from the insanity of the previous scene, and it's not because it's some action-packed spectacle. It seemed like the filmmakers were trying to fit as much as they possibly could into each scene so that much younger kids wouldn't be bored. Minions might entertain the least demanding moviegoers and their very young children, but anyone else should stay away from the contrived plot, tired jokes and dull characters littered throughout this movie.",

Although the first two films were for families to enjoy, this one is for children. Your kids will laugh their faces off at this, but I don't think its as enjoyable for the parents. Sandra Bullock wasn't the greatest as the main antagonist, however Jon Hamm was a highlight in the film. I found him very entertaining in the role that he played, and he was the funniest thing in this movie. The main (Minion) characters, Stuart, Kevin and Bob were very entertaining, but most of it was slapstick humour you'll find funny the first time you watch it, probably not the next million times your kids chuck the DVD on (Kind of like the first Cars). I'll give the film credit, as its just a bit of harmless fun for the kids, but its not a great film in general.

Now comes a third time to film and feel that is still not the strongest as the first of despecable me. Sure it has some addiction problems: 1 is the villain. Bone is not poorly designed or the performance of Sandra Bullock is wrong, its wrong for the reason that is really bad. She wants revenge on the minions beacuse Because she believes that betrays. I do not know but that I found it quite absurd,unnecessary and stupid. And 2- Starring Kevin. Kevin is one of 3 Minions I find it funny but it really was not necessary that all the attention in the third part of the film takes. It was supposed to Kevin, Stuart and Bob are the protagonists throughout the film, but not only Kevin, Stuart and Bob in the first and second part of the movie and Kevin in the third part of the film. It is noted that screenwriter Brian Lynch had some addiction problems when writing the script, but still does not mean that the film is bad, there are many things they liked me the film. I like comedy, the animation, the designs, the songs, the soundtrack and the 60s  references (The Beatles reference is the best), I just think that the film could have been better without those 2 addiction problems, but what you have it is good. I soprende enough that this film is the second highest grossing of all film, and even not the real reason was actually to make this film, whether it was for the fans or the merchandise, which I know is that Minions promises to entertain families, and although they follow are complaining or find reasons why Minions is bad, complain of Chappie, that really is a bad film.",

Firstly, as they are minions it is a bit frustrating because we don't know what they are talking about, and the film didn't do a good job of explaining through actions. Secondly, I felt the way the minions came to be in grus possession was a bit anti climactic, and don't get me started on all the plot holes. Finally, I think the reason this movie was made was for cash, not for entertainment. So many kids were obsessed with minions and if they made a movie then the cash would come rolling in.
