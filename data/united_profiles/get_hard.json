The story plays out with James King (Will Ferrell) who gets convicted of a felony he never committed, and he gets sentenced to 5 years in a maximum security prison in San Quentin. James uses the help of his car washer, Darnell Lewis (Kevin Hart) to teach him the basics of prison, and how he can survive in the godforsaken place. But, Darnell never went to prison! Get Hard uses James to use his racist stereotypes against Lewis to make it funny. Sure, Kevin Hart does his best, and gives us some belly laughs, but Will Ferrell's racist, rich and totally bonkers, James King is one of the worst things about Get Hard. The pair do well together, even against the badly written script, the mediocre direction and the bland story, to create a funny movie. I appreciate the ways Get Hard takes you under the \"hood\" of prisons, and tells you about rape, and assaults in prison from a funny perspective. And, T.I gives a good performance as a Crenshaw Kings boss. All this, could have summed up to a really funny movie, but Get Hard doesn't try enough to get that medal. It's badly written, racist, offensive and gives us the worst Will Ferrell performance in years. But, if you don't get offended easily, Get Hard may be fun for you.",

Hart's motor mouth provides most of laffs, while Farrell's broad, buffoon style is often annoying. There are memorable out comic moments and almost nobody in the supporting cast adds any humor (T.J. Jagodowski's friendly gay is an exception). The dialogue feels like writer/director Elan Cohen let the 2 leads improvise most of the bits and didn't exercise any control on their effusive styles.

It's not the best R-rated comedy but I loved that it's roars it's R rating, and is laugh out loud funny at times, and the chemistry that Will Ferrell and Kevin Hart is easy going. James King (Will Ferrell) is a rich and is a financial analyst  he has a huge mansion in Bel Air, lives with a soon to be married beautiful fianc\u00e9 Allissa (Allison Brie) and is promoted by Allissa's father Martin (Craig T. Nelson). Kevin Hart plays Darnell he is a hardworking car wash operator, lives in Crenshaw with his supporting wife Rita (Edwina Findley Dickerson) also smart daughter Makalya (Ariana Neal). Darnell wants to get Makayla and Rita out of the neighborhood and school hoping his daughter will go to another school. James is convicted and fraud sentenced to 10 years in San Quetitin. So he wants Darnell, the guy who washes his car, to help him survive in prison Darnell didn't go to prison, James just thinks he did because of his skin color. James is flat out racist, I honestly didn't care if he goes to prison or not that's how unlikeable he is. The cheap script by Etan Cohen (Tropic Thunder), Ian Roberts (Martin & Orloff) and Jay Martal gives us a few laughs here and there but honestly they know better than this mediocrity so does Ferrell and Hart but they make this mediocrity funny at times. The talented Allison Brie and Craig T. Nelson are miss cast they put nothing good here to the table playing charactures. 3.0/4 stars",
