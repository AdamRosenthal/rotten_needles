So stop comparing it to The Mortal Instruments etc. Twilight was a love story. TMI is much more than that. As far as I can see if you don't love sci-fi, action, romance, comedy, fantasy in one novel and movie. It's not for you. But don't bash it because it didn't meet your needs. TMI will always have it's book fans and they will grow from fans of the movie and be supported. Shadow Hunters are not going anywhere. Oh and to the person who said that Cassie stole ideas from other novels/movies. Why are you not bashing every vampire, werewolf, witch etc. film/tv show or book made? Those ideas were ledgends already here before you were born. So no one stole any 'idea'. I love the books and the movie. x",

So I don't think that Cassandra had any say in the writings for the movie what so ever and I'm pretty sure that they are supposed to consult the author of the book for her ideas on how she wants it. The only part about it that I liked was the midnight flower scene, I think that that is the only thing that they got right. Also I would have went with a different actor for Jace and Alec. So in conclusion I don't think that they should make the second book into a movie, and I'm sure that after seeing the first one Cassandra won't sell the rights to the second book. That was the only reason that they didn't continue with the Eragon movies.",

      "text": "For those of you who didn't read the book, City of Bones, this movie may seem a bit confusing to you. This film is kind of like a cliff notes version of the book. Certainly they had to cut things out of the nearly 500 page novel, but some key moments are simply touched upon with a line or two, making the movie a bit confusing at times. Clary Fray (Lily Collins) is a seemingly normal girl, who for some reason can't stop drawing a symbol. When she starts asking about the symbol, she is pulled into a world she never knew existed. As it turns out, Clary is keeping secrets, secrets she doesn't even know she has. It's those secrets that will eventually put her life, and the lives of everyone she knows, in danger. At first, the two main characters seem like they are completely different and won't have any chemistry at all, but as time goes on, they learn they're more alike than they think. Once their on the same page, the story really takes off. Lily Collins (Abduction, The Blind Side) really takes hold of her character and gives the film a strong female lead, that rivals Katniss Everdeen. Collins is paired with British heart-throb, Jamie Campbell Bower, who is a lot more than eye candy. I'd never seen Bower in anything, except bit parts in Twilight and Harry Potter, but the guy has some serious fighting skills. Bower is another one who at first doesn't seem to fit, but in the end really helps to make this film something special. To answer the big question about City of Bones, no, it is not as good as the book and you really shouldn't have expected it to be. The novel is massive and has entire parts that simply couldn't be transferred to the big screen. Some things were left out that shouldn't have been, while some of the more fast paced scenes were extended for the screen. All in all, I thought this movie was a pretty good representation of an excellent novel and a great film to include in your next movie night.",

The first two acts were a constant parade of exposition and action scenes with almost no time for character development. On top of that, the pacing, acting (save for the main actress), and script are fairly poor. Plot threads are set up and left dangling, possibly for the sequel or possibly because of the cut source material. Some reviews label it as the next Twilight, but to me it feels like the next Eragon. Twilight at least set time aside for characterization, though admittedly the romantic chemistry is just as bad. There are some redeeming moments, but those can't be discussed for spoiler reasons and they raise even more questions. The least that can be said about it is that it's entertaining, but the truth is that you've seen this movie before and better under many different titles. No need to waste your money on this one.",

I wanted to have fun time watching this film, I was expecting a fun guilty pleasure movie, but this film sucks the fun out like a vampire sucks out the blood out of a human. So it misses it the opportunities, instead it feels like a familiarity of things we have seen before in successful and well-made films. In New York City, we meet an ordinary teenage girl Clary Fray (Lilly Collins) learns she is descended from a line of Shadow Hunters half angel warriors who protect humanity from evil forces. After her mother (Lena Headey) disappears, Clary joins forces with a group of Shadow Hunters and enters the Downworld, an alternate realm filled with demons, vampires and a host of other creatures. Clary and her companions must find and protect an ancient cup that holds the key to her mother's future. Collins's performance was annoying, whiny and just not good at all so is her love interest in the film Jamie Campbell Bower. At least the film didn't bore me to death it actually was interesting. I did not read the book series by Cassandra Clare, but I'm judging this as a film there's a TV show based on Clare's novels just hope it's not bad like this film. 1. 5 out of 5 stars.",

I should have turned this movie off after the first 20 minutes.  If they really wanted to turn this into a franchise then maybe they should have followed the book a little more closely like, oh, I don't know, Harry Potter, The Hunger Games, Lord of the Rings, even The Help, which anyone who read these books can see they tried to stay as close to the book as possible.  I would be shocked if the author had any say in this movie because why would you want to throw away everything you worked so hard to achieve by turning your book into a bad movie.
