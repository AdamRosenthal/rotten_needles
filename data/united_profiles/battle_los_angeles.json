Its not the best sci-fi, alien invasion movie i've ever seen but its far from the worst. The film begins with a mysterious objects, initially believed to be meteors crashing into some of the worlds biggest cities oceans however the objects turn out to be spacecraft carrying extra terrestials who have began attacks around the world. Set in modern day LA the film follows a platoon of US Marines fighting for Los Angeles. The one thing the film has in its favour is that it does seem realistic. The setting is stunning particuarly in showing a decimated LA where the action set-pieces work wonderfully and are the best features within the film as its explosion after explosion. Theres no real standout performances although Aaron Eckhart is good in the lead role not his finest hour but he puts in a solid enough performance. Overall, Battle: Los Angeles is hardly revolutionary and there have been better films under this genre (District 13) and it is a bit predictable as most people will have seen it all before however that doesn't make this a bad film. Visually its marvellous and the explosive shootouts are excellent. Won't be for everyone but for action/sci-fi fans you can't go wrong!",

      "text": "I walked into Battle Los Angeles hoping for a different alien invasion film. One that would be both creative yet action packed. I walked out somewhat happy. Battle Los Angeles in short, is the same ol' story you've heard 100's of times before. Aliens have come to planet Earth and they are not nice, they have one thing in mine, destruction of the human race. Enter Aaron Eckhart's character, (who for the life of me I can't remember the man's name) an old ravaged marine who has a notorious reputation for reasons I won't discuss (part of the story). But the thing is, Battle LA distinguishes itself from the alien film crowd because it feels more like a an action packed, adrenaline pumped, war flick. Put it this way, if you tried to combine Saving Private Ryan and Skyline, with the hand held camera of Cloverfield, you pretty much get Battle Los Angeles. (*hint* this movie is twenty times better than Skyline) From then on the story kicks off and gets very intense, heartpounding, and emotional. Most of the film coincides into absolutely brilliantly shot firefights and shootouts with a gritty and mature feel. And that's about it, Battle Los Angeles doesn't feature a story that will blow you out of the water, but incredible action sequences. However the acting in Battle LA is pretty good, mainly because of Aaron Eckhart, who absolutely outdoes himself on all accounts, only everybody will be thinking of Two Face when they see his character. There is however one very, very, very emotional moment where many loose ends are tied up and it ends in a bittersweet, sad, but beautiful moment where Aaron Eckhart delivers the speech of a lifetime. The last thing worth mentioning is the ending which leaves something to be desired. It's not that it's bad, it's just that you feel left robbed of an ending that actually \"feels\" like an ending, one that ties it up more. Overall Battle Los Angeles is the movie I was hoping for, but not as creative, story driven, or as much of an end of force I had hoped for.",

People tend to forget that the best stories are often repeated to exhaustion every other year with a different tweak and a different cast, and they still go and clamor each title - yet, for this movie, \"more of the same\" was seen as negative. It has all the best elements of a good sci-fi, of a good drama, and of a good movie, and the fact it's long and try to engage you with the characters, while not that all successful, is a merit to this movie. Yes you have seen this movie before dozens of times with different names, but that's exactly why this is so good: it does not try to set itself apart from \"all of those other invasion movies\", instead, it munches all the good qualities and point of views together to make a WHOLE experience. It's not just the point of view of some survivors, not just the point of view of some mariners, not the point of view of the President, not even the point of view of a joe-doe with a camera - it's all of that, together, and with a fine print: the aliens MAKE SENSE, their goals MAKE SENSE, the strategies MAKE SENSE, and how mankind try to fight back MAKE SENSE - that, alone, sets this movie apart, and way above, most of the others. Perhaps it's too smart and logic to critics or the common viewer, but those looking for more, this is it, THE invasion movie, period. Why I rate it 9 and not 10? because the movie failed at MARKETING and telling people this movie was a different take on the invasion subject, and not just \"another\" invasion movie.",

I watched it twice so far, my wife as well, and plan on purchasing the bluray which I don't often do.  It will sit beside Lost, star trek, star wars, WITH PRIDE!",

There is no attempt to humanize the invading forces, they are attacking us, and we are defending ourselves - it's as simple as that.  There isn't any crazy secret plot., it's a straight action and suspense film with a good science fantasy backdrop to the picture.  The music?  Any score by Brian Tyler is epic, and it does immerse you in the picture.  The action style is a mix of Black Hawk Down/Cloverfield/Documentary style that tries to engage you in the action directly.  There are a few epic battle shots that show the overall scenario they are facing, but not many.  If you are expecting hundreds of fighter planes like Independence Day (which I loved), you don't see that in this film.  This is squad based combat, following the actions of 8-12 marines...and you do get the feeling of being in the trenches with them.",

Instead of delving into that realm, the directors/producers made a very simple movie that is entertaining and realistic which is a breath of fresh air to me.

The story carries the movie well enough, with logical story progression, and a very comforting lack of pointless scenes.  You learn a little bit about some of the characters, their lives, who they are, and then BOOM - it hits the fan.

Simply put, B:LA is Black Hawk Down meets Hurt Locker meets Independence Day; the movie contains a whole lot of Marine Hoo-Rah and just the right splash of (believe it or not) \"eye-welling\" tender moments. I have to note that while the acting overall was not Academy Award winning, B:LA did avoid becoming cheesy. It came close on one or two occasions, but managed to come back from the Cheddar precipice. Of note, Aaron Eckhart carries the movie taking a story that might merely have been outlandish and making it believable, and frightening. Even Michele Rodriquez, one of Hollywood's lesser talented and most stereotyped actresses, brought a bit of sensitivity to her role. Visuals are state of the art, and the score was just right in both the moments of high action and moments of tenderness completing the roller-coaster ride.

The effects were great, hiding the alien ships kinda like Paranormal Activity, the first one, not the second one where you already know what's going on. There were a few too many characters, but most of them get killed off before it becomes too much of a problem. My thing was that this was probably the closest video game movie I've ever seen. You start out in a street shootout, then shootout in/around the police station, then a driving section, stealth section to take down the drone, a big bridge battle where the enemy brings out a big gun machine/boss character, then another driving section, another stealth section, then a survival section where you try and stay alive until the missile hits including another boss mech, and finally the big push where they rush the enemy. It was almost eerie. My biggest problem was the pacing. Since the battles are so hectic and cluttered, it really feels long. But what I loved most about it was the character evolution that happens with Eckhart. The Sergeant is put through a major catastrophe and through it he realizes that despite his previous failures he still belongs in the Marines. If you look for it, there's a personal story in here. But all in all, a very good movie.",

Battle L.A is fantastic the Cinematography is great , one thing i thought was new and innovative was that the Aliens acted much like humans which not many, or if any, movies do. The ending although classic really kept me guessing i thought it would end one classic way but it didn't, it really had me wondering what would happen next. This movie is not for people who hate action, guns, or Aliens. But if you love one or all of these i would highly recommend this movie.

There was the perfect, yet subtle amount of characterization in the start of the film that was just enough to understand each character.  It also expertly placed the news segments throughout the film to allow the audience a chance to see the global impact as well as learn more about the aliens.  I really don't know what people are complaining about.  By the end of the movie I was exhausted from gripping the arm rests in suspense, and that rarely happens for me.  This is Black Hawk Down meets District 9, and I put it right up there in the same caliber of those two movies.  The plot doesn't twist and turn, but that is not what I expected out from it.

I walked into the movie theater hoping that this was another case of the critics being pretentious and irrationally contrarian, what i got to see was this steaming pile of garbage that deserves universal disdain, do not under any circumstances pay money to see this movie.",

      "text": "If scenes existed in a vacuum, maybe the stabs at drama that the filmmaker attempts in \"Battle: Los Angeles\" wouldn't be so jarring. Scenes, however, are interlocked, comprising of a contextual whole with a predominant tone, and the tone in this \"Saving Private Ryan\"-style sci-fier is escapist, regardless of its shaky-cam documentary aesthetic designed to make the fantastical meld together with reality. As advertised, \"Battle: Los Angeles\" plods along noisily and with a minimum of dialogue, pitting an infantry of nondescript marines against the aliens who have come for our water in war-torn Santa Monica. So far, so good. On a rescue mission, the marines discover a father and son, and a helpful veterinarian on the other end of an answered distress signal, who are then made to board a yellow schoolbus that should make them easy pickings for the clunky-looking invaders. But maybe they're colorblind. Following an alien autopsy conducted under the watchful eye of that serendipitous veterinarian(Bridget Moynahan gets to deliver a classic line), Staff Sergeant Michael Nantz(Aaron Eckhart) determines that the right side(\"where the heart should be\") is the killshot, but not a whole lot is made of this intelligence. Blowing them up to kingdom come proves to be equally effective. And so it goes, for better or worse, \"Battle: Los Angeles\" is a live-action video game that can't be bothered with details or human emotions. Not satisfied with fiery explosions and perfunctory dialogue, however, Sgt. Nash, alluded to being John Wayne earlier in the film, goes \"She Wore a Yellow Ribbon\" on his men by delivering a sentimental, ham-fisted speech that will emit more guffaws than tears from moviegoers. After all, it's not the Germans whom they're engaged in war with, but rather, it's a battalion of water-powered aliens, and poorly-conceived ones at that.",

All could have been forgiven if the action was similar to the first fight scene. I was originally blown away and fully immersed in the combat. Then the rest of the movie happened. The rest of the film is just riddled with awkward dialogue, clunky character direction, and outlandish situations even for an alien movie. Please be my little Marine and pass this movie up.",

      "text": "Much ado about nothing, unfortunately. Don't get me wrong - I love movies about aliens - I think they're out there somewhere, and eventually we'll meet them - but until then, we'll just imagine them on screen, right? Battle: Los Angeles has such a great cast, how could it possibly go wrong? Aaron Eckhart, Bridget Moynahan and Michelle Rodriguez are NOT B movie actors - they are high-caliber Hollywood A-listers - right? Or so I thought when I saw the trailer... But after viewing the movie, I was actually quite angry, because Skyline actually did a better job with less money and NO A-list movie stars. Here's where Battle L.A. went wrong: It spent entirely too much time on character development, and not enough time fleshing out the aliens and their advanced technology. What is an alien invasion flick without aliens and special effects? The deceleration coronas that the spacecraft create before landing were probably the coolest things we saw - besides the energy weapons the aliens used. We are warned of impending danger. We see everyone gathered around their televisions, watching the earth-shattering, unbelievable news. Then, at the climactic moment, we see the aliens rising on the water and eventually taking the beachhead - all from far off - and we think we're in for a fun ride - that never quite takes off. Unfortunately, we are given no exposition regarding the origins of the aliens, and we don't really get a good look at them. We do, however, get a good look at the marines who fight them - and fight them - and fight them - inside their alien technology exoskeleton armor. \"Where's the beef?\" This movie works best as a Marine recruitment video - not as a special effects blockbuster. By the time the aliens were effectively repelled, I simply didn't care any longer - I just wanted the \"Battle\" to be over.",

Theres so many things wrong with this movie, even tactically; why would you send a black hawk in to extract your team and civillians when the enemy has annihilated your entire air force division in the area? Marines are trained to shoot the torso, which is the alien's weakness, yet they have to discover this already trained tactic to survive? If you drive in a huge orange bus throughout the second largest city in the country dont you think the enemy will see you? Perhaps i overthought the tactics of the movie, so you might say \"just take it as a summer blockbuster,\" yet, even with that, its awful. The \"last stand\" event is a nearly frame for frame remake of the ending battle of saving private ryan, and war movie cliches abound; wounded men shout and argue with their commanding officers to leave them behind, the black guys always die first, nothing bad happens to the children (well admittedly, one has his father killed), men with deep husky voices come out of epic explosions unscathed, its rediculous.

In summary, the rest is follower. Thiz movie is closer to the first one. From the first minute it is very clear we will only see through a single perspective. A staff Sergeant (Aaron Eckhart) was given an assignment to assist 2nd Lieutenant and his platoon. Their objective is deploying to City of Los Angeles and defends from alien aggression. I could easily say the movie effectively dragging us into middle of specific situation, where we will be able to experience what it feels like to be one of those U.S. Marines in that war zone. Thiz experience is just like when we were playing one of those video games like COUNTER STRIKE, HALF-LIFE and CALL OF DUTY. We are forced to take a role in it, to be anxious and worrying when Alien sneaking nearby, or think along what should be the best strategies to evacuate a group of civilians, and finally how to find their weaknesses and use it to fight back. Like all the Alien movies, thiz new form of Alien also has a weakness. In INDEPENDENCE DAY they defeat it by installing the computer virus into their mothership, meanwhile in MARS ATTACK! (1996) they destroy it with the song! Find out yourself, what is the weakness in thiz version of Alien. The Director is Jonathan Liebesman (known for TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE: THE BEGINNING (2006)) and the rest of the Casts are: Ramon Rodriguez, Michelle Rodriguez, Ne-Yo, Bridget Moynahan and many more. The Director seems to be very skillful in using Hand-Held camera techniques, no matter how shaky the picture is, we could still see it comfortably. The only disappointment is that in the movie trailer showed alien arrivals caused mass panic from some of the famous cities all over the world, and we also saw a dynamic breaking news style which is make us thinking that thiz movie is a worldwide apocalyptic movies. It does not happen that way, you are just about to follow a platoon of soldiers. The focus is simply smaller.",

It seems Aaron Eckhart's acting saves the movie from not being enjoyable. But really, there are some emotional scenes, and after the action starts going it does not lose excitement until the movie is over. Interestingly, the story does not concentrate on the overall impact of the alien invasion on a global scale, but focuses exclusively on one small team of marines and how they try to survive while contributing to defending their country. On the one hand, the military's representation might be a little bit one sided for it only shows good soldiers, while really in every big group of people there are black sheep. However, on the other hand, people who might be opposed to the existence of the American military should see with this movie that its major function is protecting their own people. There is only very little critical element in the beginning of the movie, but it does compare the shocking alien invasion to the human's \"handbook of how to colonize\", therefore confirming that the humans have behaved towards each other in the same cruel way.

You get Battle: Los Angeles, probably the most underrated film of the year. I mean, seriously, critics? You guys have such high expectations! Oh well, anyways, I'd like to point out the bad things first, because that's the kinda guy I am. at one point i the film, the CGI got really hard to look at, and there were two little girls who were completely pointless characters. All they do is scream, cry and hold the solders'  hands from time to time. Do they bring out any emotion like that one older boy? NO! Why, movie makers, Why? But other than that, the film was actually better than I expected! And I felt a connection to the beginning part where the aliens first reveal themselves at the Santa Monica Pier. I thought \"Holy sh*t, I was just there this morning!\" Because I was. But as odd as it seems, the aliens get progressively weaker throughout the film. It seemed like they were walking tanks at the start, but then turned into weak-ass grunts near the end. Whatever, the aliens aren't something we haven't seen before, and that's that. Great movie, great acting, okay CGI, but two pointless characters.",

That's pretty much how BLA turned out, but one redeeming feature was how much it resembled war-related pictures such as \"Black Hawk Down\" as opposed to crappy sci-fi movies such as \"Skyline\".",

      "text": "Set in present day Los Angeles, Battle: Los Angeles follows a platoon of marines playing their part in defending the city against a large scale alien invasion. Granted, not for everyone's taste. Imagine Black Hawk Down meets Independence Day with all the usual war movie cliches thrown in and then some for good measure. Credit should be given to the screenplay for not giving in to the usual expletive filled rants so typical of marine films. This allowed the film to be rated 12 and I'm sure was appreciated by younger cinema-goers. The almost-documentary style filming of the aliens arrival and initial platoon movements work and the film is capable of developing a pretty reasonable level of suspense as the platoon encounter the first aliens. The special effects are fantastic and result in several visually intense action sequences. Bryan Tyler should also be praised for producing a big epic score that fits well with the scale of the invasion and the task faced by the characters. Ultimately though, the cliches win the day and the film pays for not providing any real human aspect for the viewers to relate to, with the exception of Eckhart. Saving Private Ryan remains the outstanding reference for how war movies can engage the viewer through character emotion. Sadly this is lacking in Battle, but the film will definitely appeal to sci-fi and action fans without a doubt.",

But once it gets into the action, it really draws your attention. It tends to, at times, bring in some thrills, which really is the first half of the movie. But when you come up to the final battle, it tends to lose its suspensing thrills and seems to be an action like movie. As far as acting goes, its pretty decent.

I enjoyed it. Many others will not but for me I looked past the cliched characters to just enjoy the action and the explosions. It was a fun sci-fi action ride. Go in with high expectations and you may be disappointed. Go in with your eyes on some popcorn fun and you will be delightfully surprised.",
