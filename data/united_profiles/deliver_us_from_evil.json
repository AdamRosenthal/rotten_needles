Scott Derrickson skillfully and realistically captures the dark ambience common to both in powerful ways (via the depiction of aversive elemental and environmental settings; an absence of light; an absence of sound; an ominous musical score; and initially disbelieving characters driven to self-discovering belief through their exposure to overwhelming events). The film's portrayal of police tactics, dialogue and procedures is spot-on and its descriptive narration on uncommon subject matter such as primary evil, diabolical oppression, and possession is likewise noteworthy. Moreover, the explicit detail provided on the six stages embodying every genuine exorcism could have been given by the Jesuit Exorcist, Malachi Martin, himself. I give this film a 5 Star rating and predict that it will soon join both The Exorcist(1973) and The Exorcism of Emily Rose(2006) as cinema's ultimate expression of the preternatural realm at work in the real world.",

Unfortunately in this flick what he endeavours to do is uplift a bland tale of devilry, savagery and diabolism and mashes it up with gore, dark and a lot of cop activity. Thanks to \u202aEric Bana\u202c who works really hard to make the true story script appear top-notch otherwise there is nothing that makes you skip a beat in the entire movie at all.",

The actors did an okay job despite their cliche'd roles, basically we dumb two cops trying to solve an ancient a occult case. In my opinion Derrickson's 2012's \"Sinister\" was one of those films were you **** your pants while  enjoy a good horror film it's one of the  best of the year. Also based on a true story it just makes this movie dumber, even though the effects are bloodcurling, it can be entertaining at times. Grade C",

      "text": "Considering how difficult it is to find a decent modern exorcism flick, it's always nice to find one that will be a visceral and sometimes scary ride. Deliver Us from Evil is one of those movies. Sinister director Scott Derrickson takes the helm of this cop procedural turned possession film Deliver Us from Evil which is based on NYPD sergeant Ralph Sarchie's allegedly \"non-fiction\" novel Beware the Night. I believe that this is based on true events about as much as I believe that The Conjuring and The Amityville Horror movies are \"based on true events\", but let's just roll with it. In Deliver Us from Evil, NYPD sergeant Ralph Sarchie, played by Eric Bana, teams up with a priest schooled in the rites of exorcism to investigate a series of crimes around their city. What makes this movie so much different than other exorcism movies is that it is primarily a cop procedural. A lot of the twists and thrills come from Sarchie investigating these crimes and finding new information and evidence, making this a uniquely gritty possession film. Deliver Us from Evil mostly thrives on the unpredictability of the plot rather than gross-out scares, Scott Derrickson's direction also allows some dense atmosphere throughout the entire film. Unfortunately, there are quite a few unnecessary jump scares littered throughout the movie. Some of the jump scares do actually work, but for every one that works, there are two more that fail miserably. It's the biggest drawback to an otherwise good film. Deliver Us from Evil, despite some horror cop-outs (pun definitely intended), is a gritty and surprisingly entertaining exorcism flick that should surprise and even scare you.",
