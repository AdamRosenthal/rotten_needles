Colin Firth is marvellous as George, an English professor living in California who has lost his love of 16 years Jim (Goode). Firth brings so much more to his character and his presence is outstanding. His supporting co-star Julianne Moore is also brilliant as Charley, she doesn't have much screen time but Moore uses it wisely and cherishes every second she has on screen. The film is accompanied with a haunting score, beautiful costumes and perfect art direction. Ford's film is definitely worth a watch and will be one to remember for a long time.",

And, yes, while he IS a single man, the reality is, this movie is rooted at perspective.  More precisely, the differences in perspective.  Male vs. female. Old vs. young.  Teacher vs. student.  Happy vs. sad.  Such a very human film, A Single Man is a rivetingly written and acted portrayal of a love unexpectedly lost.  In all its flaws and sadness, a man struggles with the sudden loss of his true love, feeling like he's supposed to move on, to live and tries very hard over a year to do so.  Yet, he realizes time doesn't heal him and the clarity he finally comes to is that death is much better than the life he's made to live without his love.  He attempts to take his life and just can't seem to do it, no matter how much he may want to.  In the end, life takes him, just as a part of him is shown a slice of being able to move forward.  Colin Firth's performance is even better than his Oscar-winning role in the King's Speech, proving he is one of the most underrated talents in film.  The key to this film though is the story and flawless direction. This one is not to be missed.",

Interesting thing is that, the drama not only involves social relationships, but also mid-age crisis, which certainly combines with an outrageous incident, shaking the protagonist life, living him (her in Nocturnal Animals) naked and alone facing the contemporary world. These, surely, makes them doubt the present, revive the past and let the future drift. The thing with Tom Ford and what makes so unique his direction; is that without neglecting clue aspects like screenplay, music and performances (which are wit, straight to the point and superb, especially Colin Firth), some accessory features take an important part in the significance of the film, changes in illumination, costume design and make-up; all together in full coherence with the rest of the film.",

Colin Firth foreshadowed his creaming off the profits for follow-up The King's Speech, with his ceaselessly realistic turn as a secretly gay college professor who grieves about the death of his long-time lover. While 2010's TKS is a such a flawless perfection of movie making, ASM's plot is more interesting and the final good is mesmerizingly artsy. Nicholas Hoult, relatively unknown by the time this film was made, impresses as the young student who comes in the life of Firth's character after his loss, and Matthew Goode makes the best out of his little screen time. I never expected that a first-time-filmmaker would be able to stun me as much as Tom Ford did with this movie. The use of colors to express emotions, the ability to turn mundane conversations into such absorbing dialogue, the knowledge of how to use the score (oh, so beautiful!) in due time, etc. It's not a movie to watch many times since it gets a bit boring then, but at first watch, you'll be overwhelmed by this movie.",
