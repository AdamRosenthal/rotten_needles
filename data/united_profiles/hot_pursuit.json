A bunch of people in masks shoot a detective and Danielle's husband, Cooper and Danielle are framed, the police are chasing them and the bad guys. The film's trailer spoils the jokes making them less clever when you watch it on the big screen, I was just waiting for them to say the one liners from the trailer (really that's how these studios are going to market their comedies?). After almost winning an Oscar for the strongest and beautiful film \"Wild\" Resse Witherspoon is in this stale boring film \"Hot Pursuit\" I guess she wanted to come back into the comedy genre again? Her character is sort of like able, but her accent is rusty. There is chemistry between the leads, this film tries to be like the raunchy wickedly clever buddy cop flick 'The Heat' (Starring Sandra Bullock and Melissa MCcarthy). Sofia Vergara's character is annoying but really is clever. The jokes actually were funny but in the beginning they were tiresome and flat. The gags don't work and since this film is written television writers: David Feeney (New Girl) and John Quaintance this film is sort of meant for TV. I don't get how the writer of \"New Girl\" (which from it's reception says the show is good) wrote this script. Director Anne Flecther often gives us some funny slapstick scenes put overall her also producers of the film Witherspoon and Vergara give us Brobdingnagian mess. 2/4 stars",
