      "text": "The film is well-shot and paced, with lots of original sources speaking. The efforts of Spitzer to bring some fairness and justice to Wall Street and Albany are somewhat detailed, are fascinating and deserve a whole film of their own. It seems he was quite ahead of the curve in the matters of unregulated banking and investing gone wild and its ultimate effects on our economy. Depictions of the rise of the escort service that he was eventually linked to seems extraneous compared to the interesting evidence shown that the exposure of his activities outside marriage were driven by a high-tech lynch mob with deep Wall Street pockets. It is sad to see  yet another example of how much influence the powerful and wealthy have over political and legal matters, but it was refreshing to see, at the end, how Spitzer is unusually gracious and unbitter in his mea culpa regarding the use of prostitutes.",
