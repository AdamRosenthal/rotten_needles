After seeing some TV Spots, I thought this movie would turn out pretty good. But after actually seeing this movie, it wasn't as good as I had hoped. Lets start with the good. The acting. Natalie Portman and Aston Kutcher do fine in their respective roles. Both of their small groups of friends are hilarious. I really liked them. The movie itself was funny at times, but just not enough to make me laugh as much as a movie like Zombieland(one of my favorite comedies ever). On to the bad. Where Ashton's character works sucks. All the characters there are annoying and/or stupid as hell. Also, the movie really began to drag at points, especially near the end. I was just sitting there for the last ten minutes saying to myself \"Shouldn't it be just about ovr by now?\" Those pacing issues really hurt this movie a lot. Overall, No Strings Attached is an OK rom-com that I wouldn't buy on Blu-ray or watch on HBO, it's just something to watch on a weekday when you got nothing else going on.",

      "text": "There are only two reasons you go to watch thiz movie. First bcoz of BLACK SWAN (2010), you want to see Natalie Portman! Or you are one of those who think Ashton Kutcher is cute! The story follows Adam (Kutcher) and Emma (Portman) who are friends since childhood. Somehow they promise to use each other for physical reason which is sex! It is exactly what Anne Hathaway did with Jake Gyllenhaal recently in LOVE AND OTHER DRUGS (2010). They want sex, but in the process to that they find something more special. Kutcher has fun and easy-going character (where he did just well most of the time). On the other hand, Portman gives a balancing to their interaction. It is good, not bad at all for sure, but it is like using big Bazooka to kill a little bird, completely waste of talent. The movie comes from the Director who is the father of GHOSTBUSTERS (1984) and Arnie KINDERGARTEN COP (1990). The fun factor is still on the air for about half hour of the beginning, we could still feel the excitement and freshness, afterwards the movie becomes a never-ending boredom. In my note, what happened to modern Rom-Coms nowadays, it is almost impossible, making movie without raising Gay Issues. For example in thiz movie, one of Portman best friends is gay, and so with one of Kutcher best friends also has gay parents. Another factor that occurs to most of modern Rom-Coms lately is the use of vulgar words and irreverent dialogue, it is totally unbearable, including thiz one. By the way, if you came to see Portman being naked in the first place. Well, instead of that, you get Kutcher being naked! It is pretty ugly for the one who expects more. One good evidence of the situation that describes you fell when no strings attached.",

      "text": "\"Don't...ever...stop f*cking me!\" Who could ever forget those immortal words coming out of Kelly Preston's mouth in Cameron Crowe's \"Jerry Maguire\"? Avery, Preston's character, uninhibited and brassy, the classy woman that Dorothy Boyd(Renee Zelwegger) figures her boss' hypothetical lover to be, convinces the moviegoer that she's having the best sex ever. That lusty battle cry, over the passing years, has supplanted \"Show me the money!\" and perhaps, even \"You complete me,\" as the film's most quotable line. The titular character is completing her, all right, so to speak, in the most carnal sense of the word. But who's completing the sports agent with the newly-formed conscience? Not Avery. Hypnotized by the sideview of Preston's wildly bouncing breasts, people often have a hard time recalling what Tom Cruise says next. Quite tellingly, Jerry replies, \"Sooner or later, we'll have to stop.\" As it turns out, this would turn out to be the more important of the two epiphanies. Despite being in the throes of passion, the sports agent somehow intuits that their love is nothing more than a facade; that the sex, albeit vigorous, ultimately, has no meaning outside of pleasure, and sure enough, when their love is put to the test, the truth comes out. The strings attached to this love affair aren't heartstrings; they're status-related strings, vulnerable to snap at the slightest provocation. Jerry and Avery are a power couple; in essence, f*ck buddies, who used each other as mirrors, until one of the mirrors cracked. On a subconscious level, as Avery \"sat\" in her lover's lap, Jerry had realized that sex wasn't enough, so \"sooner or later\", just like he said, they would have to go their separate ways, whereas Emma(Natalie Portman), in the surprisingly decent rom-com \"No Strings Attached\", wants her boy-toy Adam(Ashton Kutcher) to stop f*cking her and start seeing other people, because love, the very thing our hearts and minds crave like cough syrup, is too much for her. The contract they had agreed to, which governs and formalizes their libertine actions, gets seriously breached when the sex starts to mean something. This sex, we presume, must be award-winning sex, though it's impossible to gauge, since the filmmaker condenses the bulk of the non-couple's extra-curricular activities into a snappy montage, presumably on account of Portman's reluctance to do nudity. So what we get is implied sex, all tell and no show, and that's a pity, because a lot of \"No Strings Attached\" is extremely appealing, thanks to a bevy of excellent supporting players. Best of all, the film understands how technology created this monster; this young woman who fears intimacy and seems incapable of giving and receiving love. Emma, who seems more comfortable with indirect communication, pushes Adam to his wit's end with her endless e-mailing and texting, inspiring the son of a shameless womanizer(played by Kevin Kline) to implore the woman he loves to get in her car and see him. \"No Strings Attached\" gets a lot of little things right, but where sex is involved, the film whiffs, big time. Somebody sorely needs to fake an orgasm; somebody needs to use sex as a weapon, and hurt the other person. When Adam protests that he doesn't like his penis being described as cute, he could very well be talking about the entire movie in general. For example, Adam gives Emma a mix tape, a collection of thematic songs dedicated to period blood, her menstrual cycle, which is cute, but this intern, this future doctor who balks at girly things like flowers and balloons, and a second straw in an ice cream soda, doesn't seem the type to be won over by such a silly gesture. For all her talk about monogamy being against our basic biologies, we never see Emma actually practicing what she preaches. There's another guy in the picture, a colleague at her hospital, and Adam is jealous of him, but it's unclear as to whether Emma is shagging him too. Probably not. He drives a Prius. Again, it all comes down to Portman; she hampers the film with her reluctance to put out for the camera.",

Synopsis: This film stars Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher and I'm not even gonna use their character names because you know the audience and producers don't care. Ashton and Natalie meet as teens at a summer camp and Kutcher is immediately attracted. They meet again ten years later at a party and then Natalie is kinda attracted because Kutcher let her use him as an excuse to get back at Natalie's mom...I guess?? Then they meet again five years later and she is attracted to him more? Kutcher then is told that his old girlfriend is bonking his dad and has been for a couple of months. Because of this trauma Kutcher wakes up in Portman's apartment and that morning they have sex. Which I don't understand because the night before he acted like a drunken fool swinging his wang around in her face. I mean come on! What MIT med student would tolerate that? Ok sure he is \"Ashton Kutcher\" but still! The sex is so good, even though it didn't seem that good in the scene, that they decide to become \"sex buddies\". Natalie Portman is a super Commitafobe and is the driving force that keeps them apart. But eventually blah blah blah you know the rest of the film. Review: Ok this film is terribly written, actually...I take that back. It's not that it badly written it's that it hits all the formulaic RomCom plot points. I guess its predicability what makes it so annoying. You've seen this movie before and you've seen it done better. Examples of the terrible writing with cliched dialogue: \"you always do this, you always find something wrong with everyone who likes you\" \"please say something\" \"I'm not letting you go\" None of the other side characters are remotely interesting. Every single one of them falls flat. Also the girl who plays the sister of Natalie Portman, they look nothing alike. Not that I have anything against Olivia Thirlby, she was good in the Wackness. Portman and Kutcher's chemistry is lukewarm and feels highly manipulative. On another note, Natalie Portman totally owns Ashton Kutcher in this film. She out acts him in almost every scene. Plus she looks smokin gorgeous and Kutcher body is all flabby. I mean come on Ashton I know you're tall and your genes have passed down a ridiculously gorgeous face, but you gotta try a little buddy. If you're a guy do not see this movie. Unfortunately if you're a not so smart teenage girl, this movie is probably like crack to you and you've probably already popped this movie into your DVD player by the time you finish this review. If only this movie were in 3D...oh wait they're already remaking this film \"Friends w/ Benefits\"....*sigh",

If anything this film is a prime example of how not to do an edgy romantic comedy (for that, watch Friends with Benefits).",

The Portman-Kutcher pairing works well in the film as the duo provides the viewer with endless entertainment. The humor in the film is very modern and specifically targeted towards today's generation. By having a female writer, something that is not typical of present day comedies, we are given a fresh and new perspective on relationships, friendships, and sex. While the plot is highly predictable, No Strings Attached is a good choice if you are just looking for a feel good romantic comedy.",

I only liked Ashton Kutchers car: a BMW 1986 E28, he acted ok, nothing very special in my opinion. Ofcourse the story was very predictible, but somehow I think this is not a bad movie. It's the best comedy ever, it's an average rom com. This movie makes me think of 'Friends with benefits (2011)', both stories are similar and ofcourse: not original. Anyway, if like a clich\u00c3",
