This a great action packed, turn off your brain and disregard physics kinda movie. The acting is spotty like it's been in movies before but it keeps you engaged. You can see the CGI in scenes where Paul Walker wasnt actually used but it's not too distracting. Definitely worth seeing in the theaters and will probably own it as well. The best part was how they handled the death of Paul Walker in real life and they send him off in the classiest way possible in the movie.",

The end sequence that uses Wiz Khalifa's \"See You Again\" is perhaps one of the most tender moment in movies I've seen in a long time, which is so amped up because Paul Walker was not present in the completion of filming this movie due to his unfortunate death.  Seeing a character that was digitally entered into scenes at times was incredible because I never knew the difference.  Furious 7 will certainly please the fans of the series, and if you're an action movie connoisseur then this is an easy recommendation.

However the chemistry between Dom and letty was weird and a bit off especially in the last act which really didn't work for me, statham was wasted he was a good villain like the winter soldier just popping up everywhere, but didn't get enough screen time and therefore wasted. The role of Tyrese Gibson was amazing he is the best comic-relief I have ever seen anytime he opened his mouth I laughed. The role of Nathalie As Ramsey was a bit sketchy and finally Paul walker's tribute was emotionally great and I almost cried.

In the past Fast and Furious movies there was one big job at the end of the movie but in Furious 7 there is a sequence of big events and the long run time is definitely worth it. Jason Statham brings what this franchise needed: a rememberable, badass villain and Tyrese Gibson brings back that comedy vibe with funny jokes and humour. I was a little disappointed not to see more of the Rock however but this mega cast has great chemistry and history. The movie is topped off with an emotional tribute to Paul Walker.

Furious 7 involves some tosh about Jason Statham looking for revenge from the gangs exploits in London and a computer chip that is bizarrely hidden in a car on the 34th floor of a tower block in Dubai. It makes no sense whatsoever and has plot holes you could drive all the cars through more than once, but there is no denying it's hugely entertaining and a suitable send off for Paul Walker.",

At the end of the day I was extremely entertained and satisfied with the final result.",
