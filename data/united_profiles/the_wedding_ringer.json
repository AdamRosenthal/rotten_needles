From trailers I thought this was going to be the least original comedy possible, merging Hitch and The Weddings Crashers into a cheesy, generic plot. After actually watching the movie, while it does have some of the elements from those films, it feels authentic and original throughout. The cast is all fantastic, with Josh Gad and Kevin Hart not having to carry the film but delivering roles that could've if required. The laughs weren't as abundant as I hoped but the film doesn't rely on them in place of content. The movie is rich with content so it doesn't use cheap laughs as a crutch the way most comedies do. Instead, it builds the humor and then truly delivers incredible comedy when it wants to. The emotions in the movie feel legitimate and the plot and characters develop in a way that makes them seem real... like if you know them and can see this taking place. Bottom line, it's difficult to explain why this movie translates so well. The critics proves once again that they don't understand humor but the actual viewer reviews seem rather positive, which is where I would suggest looking to in determining whether or not to watch the movie. For me, the refreshing take on comedy, where content doesn't take a backseat to laughter but doesn't replace it either, made for a great movie worth watching.",

Gad has ebullience and is humorous as this funny like able character, and is more funnier than Olaf from Frozen. Josh Gad plays Doug Harris he's socially awkward and is two weeks away from marrying the girl of his dreams Gretchen (Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting), but he has a problem Doug can't find any groomsmen, running out of time Doug calls Jimmy Callahan (Kevin Hart) owner and operator at Best Man Inc, Jimmy helps friendless grooms. As Doug tries to makes this con work, an unexpected bromance sparkles between Jimmy and Doug. It's not that painfully predictable but the film makes it work, Hart once again is funny and talented even though if the material is bad Hart makes it work, he has this zest and this film shows that's he more than the hyper active character you seen in Scary Movie or Think Like A Man.

It's a fairly semitropical Wedding movie featuring Kevin Heart and Josh Gad who do a great job with their characters. Sadly the rest of the film feels fairly plain and dull other than a few monuments. The dull plot aside there are a fair amount of good jokes and funny scenes to the movie that are slightly redeeming but not enough to save the film. The concept of the film is original, Kevin Hearts character is paid to be the best man for many peoples weddings and makes quite a living out of it but at the same time complicates his day to day life...surprised no one has tried this in real life yet.",
