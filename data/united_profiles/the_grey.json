In some way that I can't specifically articulate, it reminds me a bit of Meek's Cutoff (a film I don't care for), though this film is much more entertaining. The characters are a bit flat, and given the way that some of the dialogue was written, it also reminds me of more off-the-cuff, found-footage films like Blair Witch and Paranormal 3.

The wolves were made to be much smarter and bloodthirsty than they are in reality, and for some reason they would appear and disappear at random points in the movie. If you've ever seen Frozen, you know what I mean. The random disappearance/appearance lead to more than a couple plot holes as the movie went on. And then there's the fact that a man somehow jumps across a 50 foot gap.... how? The second problem is the editing. While not terrible, throughout the movie there are flashbacks that just don't seem to make sense as to where they're placed. It felt clumsy and pretty awkward. And finally, there's the ending. While it could have been worse, it still is just not good. While cliffhangers can totally be appropriate in some cases, a survival thriller is not one genre it works particularly well for. This is one ending that will more than likely make you frustrated. There are a few positive things about this movie. The acting was fine (much to my surprise), and for the most part the script wasn't bad, minus a few absolutely absurd conversations that happen throughout the film. Think of this one as Poseidon in Alaska, though this one isn't quite as bad as Poseidon. It isn't a great movie. The Grey is a pretty bland, and even laughable at a few parts.",

I can't even light my fireplace, yet these arctic plane-wreck victims had ever-ready tiki torches and found perfectly cut wood for \"spears\" at their disposal. One jumped over a river ravine into a tree on the opposite bank to string a line  for the rest to shimmy across. They're in a blizzard, and then the sun's out an all of them are fine. Liam 's drenched in a river and soon after appears dry, let alone not frozen! And, why would they ever leave the plane to walk the vast wilderness of Alaska like needles in a huge haystack. Hunker down boys, build a little hut so those wolves don't get you, pile up the bodies and eat them if need be. Seems more prudent. Remember you had all that jet fuel so easily accessible (another ridiculous moment) at the crash site to help heat, eat and keep those wolves at bay. After all, the wolves were EVERYWHERE in the end. A lot ventured, nothing gained... on the screen and for viewers. PLEASE...just ridiculous in every respect!\u00e2",

What one experiences is a cinematographic waste of astounding, achromatic transcendental visuals, hampered by the dragging sense of directorial indecisiveness and subpar writing. Aside from Neeson's valiant efforts to egress from his enslaved character, the film enthralls with its surprisingly fresh metaphysical overtones, and adhesive tie-ins toward the latter-half. As a result, \"The Grey\" is a brimmingly stern philosophical survival thriller, laden with sporadic moments of jocosity and adrenaline, yet suppressed with a taste of dissatisfied chagrin.",

It's gritty and dark and the movie portrays the overall dismal tone very well through: character conversations, setting, and suspense.  The movie is very well done, with only the blemish being the CGI wolves that seem to feel cheap.  Other than that, the movie is great.  Dialog conveys most of the story, although what is told is short and vague, it manages to give you an overarching background to the characters that is mostly complete.  The movie does a really good job of pulling you in and keeping your interest until the conclusion.  The characters were somewhat stereotypical, but not over-the-top.  The language was controlled and wasn't overdone, and I didn't feel like their was random expletives added for laughs.  The survival aspect was very cool, and Liam Neeson's character is Oscar-worthy.  This movie deserves to be nominated as best movie, best character, and best sound design.  Although, it wouldn't be nominated for best CGI; it wasn't the worst I have seen.  Overall, a great story with spotty CGI and amazing setting.  The setup to the final scene is perfect, and the way the movie ends (maybe will disappoint some), was just perfect in my opinion.

Hadn't they seen the trailer in which Neeson is shown taping a knife and small broken bottles to his hands in preparation for hand-to-paw combat with a wolf? Wasn't that enough of a clue to indicate that, er, it's a movie? You know, the type of mass media where entertainment usually takes precedent over fact? Not for a minute did I believe what I was seeing was an accurate representation of wolf behavior, nor did I leave the theater hating wolves. On the contrary, I left the theater feeling highly entertained, and with a heightened curiosity about natural wolf behavior. Subsequently I learned that although there are recorded incidents of wolves attacking humans, they are negligible. Wolves are naturally shy of humans. But I didn't go to the theater thinking I was about to see a National Geographic special either. Neeson was terrific playing a very sympathetic character trying to deal with the great sadness in his life. The slow unraveling of the truth behind his deep sadness is one of the strengths of the movie. But what I loved best about this movie was the fact that it did not turn out to be the kind of macho guys' movie the trailer led you to believe. There are some very moving scenes in the movie. Neeson helping a victim of the plane crash deal with the inevitable result of his horrific injuries was for me was quite moving. And the plane crash itself was all too realistic. Yeah, it was pretty riveting. And you'll be surprised to learn of the significance of the scene in which Neeson faces off with the wolf. Finally, don't stay for the extra scene you get after the credits roll. That extra scene, which lasts only several-seconds, is an unnecessary smear on a perfectly finished movie canvas.",

Throughout The Grey he does what he can to lead plane crash survivors through the frozen tundra of Alaska, and no one questions his age. Director Joe Carnahan takes the audience into a bleak lifestyle amid the Alaskan pipeline. Ottway (Neeson) makes it through with flashbacks of his wife and a chilling voice over. The crash is shown from within the plane and avoids many of the common theatrics. No one is clearly shown being sucked out. For that matter most of the visual effects cast a less than ideal lighting circumstance, which drives home the motif. Injuries, freezing winds, and a lack of food are enough foes for any survivors, but our heroes are being pursued by wolfs. I'm not suggesting that it's impossible, but the behavior of these creatures puts on quite the show. They've certainly seen Halloween. Credulity is also being pushed to limits when the standards line such as \"who made you the leader\" have to be muttered and one hothead fancies a brawl. Of course Neeson's dominance of the narrative makes him a safe bet, and his buddies a risk. As the film wears on I wanted to buy these blokes more time. Despite how simple the premise I'm sure I could have been entertained for 3 hours. Maybe if the other guys had more spotlight scenes they wouldn't feel so much like Ottway's human shields. The story is simple enough that a big reveal at the end is somehow more effective for the sake that no one was waiting for it. This isn't mystery. What The Grey manages to do with the underexplored is leave the viewer with less question and more statements. The Grey is a man's movie. Fatigue and despair translate with the same forceful impact of the physical blows the survivors endure. It's also a perfect example as to why one should wait for the monk's reward at the end of the credits.",

Luckily for us, we were in an empty theater, so we got to talk and jab at each other like the jerks that we are.  While we did occasionally giggle at each other about certain silly things in the movie (\"Suddenly, wolves!\" chomp), I myself did actually find myself immersed in the suspense of the movie.  There are, as is expected, a few jump scares here and there, but thankfully, there are also some subtle scares as well.  As an example, a wolf may just jump out from off camera and make a loud noise and attack, or the the camera may slowly pan to reveal that a wolf stalking close behind a character, just before he attacks.  While it is pretty plain to see that the behavior of the wolves is pretty unrealistic, I don't think it really HAS to be 100%, because at its core, that is not what the movie is about.  These wolves don't act like real ones, they're more like large monsters (I am reminded of the Worgs from Lord of the Rings).  These wolves act as the \"slasher villain\" for the movie.  The movie is mostly about the death, in itself.  Nearly all the characters  (other than the few nameless slasher victims) do in some way have a revelation about dying, and dealing with their or their friends inevitable deaths.  The movie is told from Liam Neeson's perspective, and so you feel how he is feeling the most.  I really did enjoy this movie, and unlike most people I've heard from, I enjoyed the ending a lot.  It's the only one that makes sense, really (unless you actually want a scene of Neeson fist fighting a wolf like it was straight out of Taken).  Anything else might have come off as silly.  And as a side note, Neeson's on-and-off Irish accent got a little distracting (for the first ten minutes I wondered if he even had one).",

After hearing that he'd be fighting wolves with broken glass bottles, I was definitely on board. I sat down in the theater and was prepared to see this action take place. So it starts off with him in his character as John Ottway, his job? Killing wolves with a high powered rifle to protect the workers of an oil drilling team. Some self narration involved I was taken, shushing my friends in order to pay attention. After a short while, it shows him penning a note to his wife and then shortly after putting his rifle to his mouth and almost pulls the trigger then hears a wolf howl in the background. I guess this was the jump start he needed that stops him. Upon completion of his job, him and another crew are packing up on a little plane to go home. As most could guess, this flight can't withstand the weather and goes down, leaving John and a small group of men stranded in the middle of nowhere, Alaska. As they regroup, what seems like the longest time they spend near the plane's remnants, making fires and collecting the dead's wallets as memorials to bring home if they ever made it to society. As the embark on their journey, they start to die one by one, some more honorable and sad than others as the wolves pick them off. Finally we get down to the nitty gritty of the movie and we wonder what could possibly happen, well...that's what the movie leaves you off with, even a little scene that takes place after the credits just leaves you with a bunch of thoughts of what could've happened. A great movie for topic choice, and plenty that left me wondering if Bear Grylls would've done the same, they just forgot to drink their own piss. Plenty of action and drama to be called a Liam Neeson film.  An 8 out of 10.",

It portrayed a group of men, thrown into a terrible and life threatening situation, with the odds stacked against them (throw a couple of super, mutated wolves into the mix ^^). Each one of these seven plain crash survivors die horrific and brutal deaths...nature was truly unforgiving to them. The suffering these characters endured can well be related to what people experience everyday, but can be dealt with differently, and this I think is where the movie fails miserably. Liam Neeson's character comes to the conclusion that because God doesn't help him in his horrible situation, therefore God doesn't exist and life, suffering, and ultimate death is all meaningless. From humanities limited and finite understanding, this is a reasonable evaluation and mindset BUT on the other hand, very juvenile and naive as humanity does not have all the answers. In light of the latter point, selling God short as portrayed in this movie was ignorant and cheap shot in the philosophical ring. What is suffering in a finite period of time, compared to ETERNAL joy and happiness? It is but a mere flicker in time. The two cannot be compared, especially over a divine plan. Perhaps Liam Neeson's character should have pulled the trigger in the beginning. It would have saved me from watching the most depressing movie ever made.",

The wolf attacks are often lighning fast and full of ear splitting growling and snarling which serve to keep the audience awake.

Particularly when you look at the completely silly reviews that refer to the wolves behavior as being \"unrealistic.\"  Well you couldn't have missed the point of the film harder if you tried.  The Grey is a metaphor, how men deal with that shattering loss of others and themselves.  How death is unfair, how it can come without any warning, and how even a strong willed person eventually succumbs to it no matter what they do to fight it off.  The men in the story are all powerful characters who struggle to survive and live, its not about barbaric serial killer-like wolves in a frozen tundra wasteland hell hole chasing them down one by one.  The wolves are symbolic.  Each man faced a different death and their is some theories that suggest that they all died in the plane crash, which suggests that they were in a kind of purgatory as well.  It is one of those films that really makes you wonder and even ask yourself:  \"Why?\"  Its a painful film, full of merciless deaths, some men are able to come to terms with their end, while others have their lives stolen away by the elements almost without meaning or reason.  Even the main character, a man with the strongest will amongst all of them can't save the men under his command or himself from inevitable death.  It is a bleak film, with wonderful cinematography, brutally violent imagery, wonderful performances, and yet a real message embedded within its ambiguous ending sequence.  You can fight death with every last strength in your body, but eventually it will win.  I feel that it was a film most audiences had trouble relating to, understanding, and perhaps it may have not appealed as a philosophical piece simply because of its morbid content alone.  In years to come, I hope its revisited and given its proper place as one of the best films of this decade.",

Yes, this is a joke, I just need something to keep you interested. The Grey is actually a story about plane crash survivor trying to escape cruel whip of mother nature.",

However,  the angst, dread and apprehension were not wasted. (Sweetheart put her hands over her eyes when she anticipated something nasty. She had her hands over her eyes a lot. )  The wolves were like hounds of the Baskervilles-scary. I love Liam, the voice of Aslan.  He has a warmth, and rugged honesty about him, and the soft, purring voice of the benign God.  This may be Liam's defining role as an older actor.  It may be for Liam what the Book of Eli is for Denzel. The movie was exciting.  Liam owned it, but the other actors were good.  I felt the bone chilling cold, the exhaustion, the hunger, the terror,  the hopelessness, and the absolute inscrutability of the Almighty. Yes, there was a spiritual/existential aspect to the movie.  But what was strongest to me (beside the wolf horror) was the beauty of human relationship, the sustaining warmth of memories of love and loved ones. The characters that you liked most held their loved ones ever-present in their hearts.  And Liam's memories were so tender; his emotion so genuine.

It seems like he is one of the few actors in Hollywood that actually cares about acting and cares about his fans. But my love for Liam Neeson can only go so far in a movie like 'The Grey'. There were some scenes where I was gripping my seat and wanted more, but my wish never came true. The wolves were impeccable, though. You might feel a connection with the overall meaning of the film, but it simply was not enough. The movie was way too long. Two hours was definitely unnecessary for a film like this one. I was sitting in my seat wondering when it was going to be over and then when it ended, I was still upset.  There were little stories within the bigger picture, but once the movie ended, you realized it was just filler and the writers couldn't think of anything else. The audio was really annoying. Yes, we get it. Just because they are walking through a blizzard, doesn't mean you can crank the wind sound.

After initial worry about hypothermia and the scarcity of food pervades the group of survivors, these qualms are hastily superseded by a much more malignant force- that of a pack of marauding wolves. What follows is a suspenseful, emotional and poignant story that is essentially a mediation on mortality and the extent man will go to in order to survive against all odds.

These ways would include death by fire, or by a pool of acid, slow intricate torture, but one in particular is death by slow painful ripping and tearing of your own flesh and bones. The fear of this is what fuels the fears and the suspense of stories about zombies, or sharks, or in The Grey's case, wolves. I wouldn't say the film is one of those niche fear films that targets those with particular phobias regarding wolves, but if you have such a phobia, good luck! I came into watching this film with average to poor expectations of the movie and left feeling quite good about it. I think both the story and the acting were well done. One thing I will note regarding the CGI, or visual effects, used to make the wolves is I think in a few years they will look rather funny and off. While watching, they already seemed overly soft and dark. They had an almost blurred look to them at times. Certain movies like, Jurassic Park, or The Thing(the original) may not look fantastic these days, but still look pretty darn good compared to the aging of computer special effects. But hey! Maybe I will be wrong, luckily either way, the CGI is not what made this film. In all, I would recommend this film to family and friends who haven't seen it yet, and I hope anyone who reads this may go out and watch it as well.

The wolves appearance was a bit weak, but I felt that that was forgiveable.  I wasn't sold on the ending, it was the only real ending that they could have had I suppose, but that wasn't enough for me to like it.  I choose to remember the ending differently, the only other possible ending for it - Obama parachutes in armed with a flame-thrower and missile launcher, deals with the wolves and hi-fives with Neeson, all done  to the theme of team america and saves the day.

I like much of his work and have seen most of what he's written and or directed in recent years; he is versatile and happily, in this movie, he has shown us he can do excellent character development work. I can hardly think of anyone better than Liam Neeson for the lead role. The premise of the movie is rather straightforward: A sharpshooter, Neeson, hired to protect roughnecks working at an oil facility in Alaska, from local wildlife, boards with them on a plane as they set off for their periodic break; a storm hits the plane hard and it crashes, killing most aboard. The remaining group of survivors attempt to make out of the tundra, with wolves at their heels.",

I personally enjoy Neeson's films where he plays these kinds of rolls..where we can actually see him act. Don't get me wrong, Star Wars and Taken were great movies, but in this film you get to witness Neeson taking on every day life issues that many of us face: fear of death. Neeson is tested in his strength, knowledge, and faith as he battles the bitter freezing cold in Alaska after his plane crashes. I would watch it again, but I would not pay for it again.

He usually specializes in high octane and stylized action flicks. Movies like \"The A-Team\", and \"Smokin' Aces\" look cool, but they fail to impress me on an intellectual level. Now, here we have \"The Grey\". This movie is a departure from Joe Carnahan's style. . .in a good way. This movie is toned down to a much more believable level and it has substance. A great script that has not only great dialogue and characters, but this movie's script possesses very deep philosophical and poignant moments. I walked into this film feeling that my heart strings wouldn't be threatened. This movie tugged at them up a great deal. Liam Neeson gives the best performance I've ever seen him give. I honestly thought that Neeson would be the typical badarse he's been fond of playing as of late, but his character (and all of the other as well) is so multi-dimensional, complex, and most importantly, real. The soundtrack is as touching as it is chilling. Joe Carnahan proved me wrong. This movie is a phenomenally entertaining, moving, thrilling piece of cinema. I implore everyone to go see it.",

This was marketed mostly as an action survival picture, which is highly misleading - it is neither action nor survival, but rather an existential portrait. It showcases a small band of engaging and sometimes mysterious characters, and as time progresses and their numbers dwindle, the cloud of death looms ever darker above them, and they must each in their own way confront it. Their responses range from heartfelt, to tragic, to calm acceptance, and is quite the graceful psychological study. Of course, the movie's ultimate tale is of a man who goes down fighting, even though he has absolutely nothing left to fight for, and is an incredibly moving testament to how important life and existence themselves are to us, and that even in our darkest hours, there is still a darker hour before us that we might fear above all else.

This is also definitely one of the bleakest films I have ever seen, with a nihilistic agenda I absolutely disagree with.  However, Liam Nieson gives a great performance as always, and I can't deny that overall it's a gritty, gripping movie which is way better than most movies that come out in January.  In fact, it might be one of the best January releases ever.",

I found the premise (attempting to survive against all odds) and setting (a barren cold wasteland) interesting. However, the overall execution was a little underwhelming for me. I was also disappointed in the ending, even though I can understand why some people might like it. The movie succeeded in getting me to wonder how they were going to make it out of their ordeal. However, the overall tone of their struggle left me with a negative tension throughout.",

Liam Neeson is tremendously good and the plot is very thrilling as it thickens but the film does have some Cliches story wise. The story wasn't compelling to any other film, which is good but The Grey needed some help in story writing. Overall, this taunt thriller is good for a Friday night.",

The power of human society over the individual, however the acknowledgement that we are to face death alone although fortified by the few we have loved.The music is scored wonderfully appropriately adding a foreboding to the beautifully bleak vistas of Arctic Canada. Liam Neeson has the gravitas. Brought me to tears, the heroism in this film, but not mindless, hard earned and with fear.",

A plane crashes in the middle of Alaska right in the middle of the gray wolf's hunting zone.one by one someone got eaten. honestly i did not understand this movie because instead of going to get out of the hunting zone they walked farther into it which is more dangerous. you never know when the wolves will come so its one of those all of the sudden someone is dead.",

In a lot of ways it felt close to being a horror movie which to me is not at all a complaint but got me into it more. It is very well acted and the cinematography is fantastic. I really felt as if this was actually happening and these people were really in great danger. One of Liam Neesons best performances in my books. Highly recommended.",
