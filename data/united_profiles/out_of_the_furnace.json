Director Scott Hooper hones in on his fine cast, which is in fact one of the best ensembles in recent memory, and hypnotically draws us in to their hum drum and rather melancholic lives. Pennsylvania looks every bit as bleak as I remember it from 'The Deer Hunter' and this is perfectly captured in the stark cinematography. The camera's eye treats the steel mill and surrounding areas as if they are another character and you really do get a sense of the place and the unfulfilled lives of the people living there. At times the film's tone is extremely tense, a lot of which is due to the menacing performance of Woody Harrelson who looks as if he has just stepped out of 'The Hills Have Eyes'. Christian Bale, in a rare understated but none the less brilliant turn, is even better here than he is n his Oscar nominated role in 'American Hustle'. Casey Affleck and Willem Defoe also impress and one has to applaud Sam Shepard, who seems to have an uncanny knack for being only minimally involved in really good films. The music is surprisingly beautiful given the content, which is at times extremely violent, and the film holds you in a vice like grip from beginning to end. Ironically, it is only the overt symbolism attached to the deer hunt and bare knuckle fight scenes that can be slightly criticised but, in truth, to do so would be pernickety as this is a truly outstanding film.",

The screaming standout is Harrelson, who leverages his hairlessness, crooked nose and ice-blue eyes into one of the eeriest villains since Dennis Hopper's mask-huffing sex offender in Blue Velvet. This movie chugs toward its final destination with quiet resolve. Yet for all the grand ambition to tell a modern story of two brothers steeped in ancient male codes, Out of the Furnace skids out on the oily streets of melodrama.

I have never seen Bale fit more easily into a role or take charge of a story the way he does here. Russell is an ex-con and the shame of his family. As Russell rots away in jail, his little brother, Rodney (Casey Affleck), has to take care of his ailing father, and try to keep Russell's wife from leaving him. When Russell finally gets out of jail, Rodney, an amateur fighter,  finally gets the chance to leave the rust belt and earn some real money. Rodney appears on his way to doing just that, when he disappears in a notoriously brutal part of the mountains, leaving his brother alone to try and do the right thing. Along the lines of Winter's Bone, Joe, & Mud, Out of The Furnace is another dark, rural thrillers, that is all the rage in Hollywood these days, and while there are a lot of wannabes and copy-cats, when someone figures out the correct formula you end up with a gem like this. The writing here is Oscar worthy and the character development is everything I crave in a film. Out of The Furnace is under two hours long, but when it's done, I feel as though I know the characters in the same was as if I'd just watched 100 episodes of some TV show. I felt their emotions, I was empathetic to their situations, and I was on the edge of my seating waiting to see what would happen next. These are all marks of a great film, and while I don't really care for Christian Bale, he really has never been better.",

I'm not going to spoil anything, so I'll word this very carefully.  It gives you an ending you'd want in a way that's not really satisfying.  Don't know if that makes a lot of sense but that's how it felt to me.  I also wish there were more scenes of Christian Belle hunting down the bad guys in the mountains.  For the most part though it's a really good movie.  If the competition wasn't so ridiculously tough and packed last year, I'm sure it would have gotten an acting Oscar nod (nomination) or two.  But I really have to find some poor quality movies soon, or I'll look like I praise everything.  Guess it's my fault for being so picky on which movies to watch.",

I was especially surprised by Bale's excellence - while Harralson has played some real jerks in other movies, this kind of character seemed unlike any of the characters Bale has played before (the closest comparison might be his character in The Machinist, but mostly only because of the setting the characters find themselves in as blue-collar workers).",

Add to this their upbringing in a place of hopelessness and blight - the steel mill town of Braddock PA. Both Brothers worked in the Mill as did their Father and Paternal Uncle. Christian is ok with this life and Casey is not. The former is jailed for DUI associated manslaughter and the other soldiers in the middle east; one is violently abused by inmates and the other by war associated atrocities. After the death of their Father - and their release from their incarcerations - Christian returns to the mill and Casey is beset with post traumatic stress disorder. Christian has lost his  long time girl friend to the town cop.  Casey uses the \"fight club\" ring to release violent tendencies where  his role is to take \"dives\" in order to raise money to pay off his gambling debts. Sometimes he cannot dive because his rage is so great and his shady financial backer looses a lot of money. Casey decides he wants a shot at the \"Appalachian\" boys on the fight club circuit: inbred folk tied into drugs, violence, and murder. He is  warned against this by his financial backer/mentor but is unrelenting.  He is beaten nearly to death in the mountains of New Jersey after he takes a dive.  On the way home, Casey and his Mentor are both shot and killed by the inbreeds.   Police in both PA and NJ are so fearful of this gang of yea - whose they are unsuccessful in bringing them to Justice.  Christian takes matters into his own hands. He obtains the phone number of the boss of the Appalachian club, calls him, and lures him to Braddock with the promise of money.  In  short, Christian skills fully stalks this man and kills him with his 30 ought rifle.",

Its just that good. perhaps the only reason that this didn't make it huge is that it was released at the wrong time of year with virtually no advertising and failed to even have the leading actors front it up on the morning shows. This carried over to tomatoes, and other sites where it scored perhaps 70% at best, partially due perhaps to its dark and foreboding character, and the fact that Woody plays the worse freaking character moviegoers have possibly ever seen in a dramatic film. This isn't a date night flick, or a cuddle up on the couch movie, but it is just about as solid a film noir as has ever been made, with first rate acting, an intelligible plot that never strays, and cinematography that elevates the story by reflecting the gritty underbelly of lower middle class geography and mores.",

The most immediate need of the protagonists is having enough money to make ends meet; their means, however, are only fit to attract inevitable violence. Out Of The Furnace\u2018s people spend money they don\u2019t have, and abuse alcohol and drugs to escape a life that has only two outcomes: misery and crime. The misery is that of those who work at the furnace: a dangerous and underpaid job in a dirty place, filthy as the roads that lead there, as the houses of those who work there. Crime, on the other hand, keeps money flowing, helps let the steam out, and promises an alternative to that misery; but it's all a bluff, fixed like the illegal fights and the gambling that will ruin the protagonists\u2019 lives. Everyone who works in the field knows it: nice and not-so-nice dealers, junkie gang leaders, even the powerless police. Those who don\u2019t know it are fatally bewitched, and can\u2019t see that, in reality, easy money is not enough to survive. No one survives at all, and that's it.",
