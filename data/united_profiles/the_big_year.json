The characters were well drawn and likable.  What a great cast - I love Jack Black best when he's not stuck in slapstick, silly comedies.  He's got an emotive face and deeper acting ability than he's ever given a chance to showcase in some of the more shallow comedies into which the industry has niched him.  If you ever saw his first hit - High Fidelity with John Cusack - then you know exactly what we've been missing from him in the last several years.  Steve Martin is the subtle gem that I like best - similar to recent role in \"It's Complicated.\" Owen Wilson was great as well.  They're all funny guys and don't have to try hard to be likable or humorous here.  I'm completely bewildered that this movie hasn't done better at box office.  Everyone in my theater seemed to really enjoy it.  I think they just promoted it badly - they gave fans the expectation of another obvious comedy instead of a movie done with more sophisticated humor than your average 12 year old is interested in, so the wrong people went to see it and the right audience has stayed away.",

To be perfectly honest, we felt completely ripped off by the false advertising of this piece of crap. In the previews, in every single interview with the cast, there wasn't one mention of a bird or \"birding\" in any capacity...it was made to look like something similar to The Bucket List, with the cast doing a bunch of crazy things over a year. NOT WATCHING FREAKING BIRDS! Maybe not the worst movie ever, but surely in the top 10, and definitely the most dissapointing I have ever seen. I can't for the life of me figure out why any of those guys would ever even consider doing this movie. Anyone who rated this above a zero has been eating way too many retard sandwiches...",

They shouldve promoted this movie better. Some comedic lines here and there and a great, wonderful story. I never had too big of an interest in birds but wow are there alot of categories of birds. This movie was very interesting. With powerhouses like jack black, owen wilson, and steve martin and this movie only made 3 mil opening weekend? Thats shocking. If you enjoy a heartwarming film with a powerful cast you must see this movie. You wont regret it. 8/10",

Im not gonna put it as a Comedy film but Its was very amusing .The Big Year is like an amazing Documentary about birds , About The Watcher and about the world. I like adventure and Birds and this movie showed that perfectly . Story was good but could be better . David Frankel's directing was really really good, The Movie Had an amazing ensemble cast and they all played so well. Find out so many things about Birds and The World , The Big Year is a very educational movie . Overall This movie will make u wanna fly like those birdwatchers .",

There haven't been too many films made about birdwatching let alone 'comedic' ones. The frequently changing setting matters not as the locations are simply stunning and makes some of David Attenborough's documentaries seem dull in comparison. You won't churn out any laughter with TBY but as long as you realise it's simply a quaint, little feature then you simply *might* enjoy it.",
