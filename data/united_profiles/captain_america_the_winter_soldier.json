      "text": "The best Marvel Cinematic Universe film there has ever been, with the exception of The Avengers. Captain America: The Winter Soldier is first and foremost a political thriller with the essence of a superhero movie. Returning to the role of Steve Rodgers, I can safely and assuredly say that Chris Evans is Captain America. One of the best parts of this sequel was the chemistry between the actors, especially between Evans and Scarlett Johansson. The dialogue they share stays compelling and doesn't feel forced at all. And speaking about not feeling forced, Anthony Mackie joins the cast as The Falcon. This could've easily been one of the weak points of the film, as history has proved that the addition of a sidekick tends to backfire on the film. However, Mackie does a great job in providing humour and playing a character that Rodgers can truly identify with and befriend, as they are both war veterans and have similar outlooks on life. Samuel Jackson has appeared in his fair share of Marvel films, yet he was always just a voice in the background. That couldn't be farther from the truth in Marvel's newest addition to their cinematic universe because Nick Fury finally gets down and gritty. The action has never been better and greater than they are here. From the martial arts style fights to the epic set piece battles to an incredibly shot car chase scene, this film will not only amaze superhero fans but action fans as well. Many people are interested about the Winter Soldier and if he is a worthy and menacing antagonist, and the answer to that question is an emphatic yes. Sebastian Stans's performances reminds me of Tom Hardy's Bane from The Dark Knight Rises in that both men have most of their face covered, with their eyes telling a story all on their own. Being the figure in the shadows and suddenly appearing out of nowhere throughout the movie was fantastic as it helped maintain the tone that the directors were gunning for. This is Marvel's response to The Dark Knight in terms of its dark and gritty approach, tackling spy and political themes that are very relevant in today's world. The Russo brother's directing of this film, I think, was probably the best aspect of it. They did a marvelous job in transitioning from the action scenes to the comedy, and then to the emotional character driven moments. Not to be outshined, the script was the best of the Marvel movies, and a large part of that was the character development, which some superhero movies tend to lack. Is it a great superhero movie? Yes. Is it a great MOVIE? Yes. Does it take the genre and go beyond its own limitations and journey into uncharted territory, just as The Dark Knight did? Yes. This is truly an exciting time to be living in.",

Chris Evans was great as Captain America, Scarlett Johansson owned the role of Black Widow and their relationship was great. i loved seeing how they have a conversation while kicking some serious ass, that was awesome! the action was amazing, it was awesome and intense and it felt so real! the pacing was great, the cinematography was great, the script was well-written and this movie was just so much fun to watch. i'm telling ya right now: whether you're a Marvel fan, a comic book fan or a action movie fan in general, then you're gonna love this movie. \"Captain America: The Winter Soldier\" was a fantastic sequel to \"Captain American: The First Avenger\" and honestly, i can't wait for the third one.",

For others, it's a suspenseful thriller with  tons of action and intrigue. Everything was exceptionally well done and I liked this movie alot more than I did either Iron Man 3 or Thor 2. I do not like what they did with some of the characters though, including Robert Redford's character and the fact that they turned Falcon into a knock-off side-kick. Fans of the comic books will know why Redford's character was no good and that's all I'll say about that. Everything else here is wonderful. We can only hope that the next few Marvel movies before the next Avengers can live up the hype set by this movie.

However, The Winter Soldier definitely surprised me with a relatively strong script with witty dialogue. It seems 'smarter' than the average Marvel movie. However, a major down-point was that not a single person was able to pull off a strong performance. Scarlett had an interesting character, but her acting was weak, so that really put me off a little. Well, Robert Redford certainly did not come across as evil to me, even towards the end. It was also quite obvious since the start that he was the villain, but perhaps Marvel meant for us to know that? As for Chris...as usual he's just there for people to ogle. Overall, the soundtrack was weak and uninspiring; the biggest disappointment still stems from the big mismatch between a strong script and the actor's weak performances.",

In terms of the political commentary, Captain America's sequel soars above most other superhero movies. It uses its position as a popular movie to try and bring up things  that it feels could occur in our world if we continue down the path we are going down. However, it then returns to stereotypical superhero nonsense and, generally, feels like a run-of-the-mill summer superhero movie. Sure, it is one, and is a good one at that, but that does not mean it could not step up in \"class\" a bit. On top of that, I felt the story was too much. The whole world is being threatened and all that it is being defended by is Captain America, The Black Widow, and Anthony Mackie? Really? Did Iron Man, Hulk, and Thor, call in sick that day or...? The plot was very interesting and really makes this movie what it is, but it felt more appropriate for the second Avengers movie, rather than the sequel for Captain America.",

The brief scenes with real dialogue are as corny and childish as in any other Marvel film, jokes are weak, which makes for a weird mix of serious tone and action and these cheap jokes that does not work that well. Particularly annoying is the score during the first past of the film, very American-ish in a bad and patriotic way.

No, this one is a darker and much grittier film. A political thriller where no one can be trusted,  wherever you turn, someone is trying to get you and big brother is always watching. The film is so well written and directed that you forget you're watching a super hero film and start to think it's a Bourne movie, which is a compliment. It just proves that Captain America has the ability to stand alone in the franchise, as Iron Man has done in his outings. It's packed with fine storytelling and Characters that are very well developed and come into their own as the film progresses. The screen time each of the heroes gets here is well balanced and never feels like too much or too little. Especially with a cast like this one. Redford brings the gravitas that he known for and Samuel L. Jackson finally shows us why he is the General.

It develops the characters, expand the mythology, provides an abundance of visually spectacular action, and references the zeitgeist of our time without being overly polemic or allegorical. It's a thriller with a lot of twists and turns, and the stakes, while high in any comic book movie, feel more meaningful than in any of the other Marvel films. Despite all that, it doesn't take itself too seriously, and mixes in some insider references and comic book gags successfully.",

His last really good film was Sneakers, and that was great.  Back to this film.  Redford's poor performance notwithstanding, I quite enjoyed it.  Scarlett J. has come a hell of a long way and is now more than just eye candy - she's an action hero with range.  Anthony Mackie is also HUGEly likable and terrific in his role. Emily Van Camp is underutilized.  Finally, I great enjoyed the interplay between Cap'n America and the Winter Soldier.  It's essentially the anti-Spiderman hero-nemesis relationship.  See the movie to figure out what that means.",

The characters have good dilemmas and people such as Black Widow and Nick Fury get more screen time than previous films and plenty of insight is provided into them. However, excessive action; moral dilemmas that just get dropped at the sideline; and an underused villain (although this is more misleading marketing than anything) prevent the film from being anything spectacular. Fans of the Marvel films should definitely check it out as by now you know what to expect and will probably have fun with the movie. If you aren\u2019t a fan of this genre though then this film will not do much to change your mind although if you are planning on seeing The Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), then you probably should as the events this film will likely have major repercussions in that film.

Go see this. I am very critical, and there were only three or four times that some truly impossible stuff happened, and I won't be too specific since I don't want to spoil anything. I will say that mostly it was due to some damage that regular humans took that didn't really damage them and could have killed them and at the least broke them. Other than this, I will say that Cap blocks bullets with his shield a lot and it just got ridiculous at one point.",

The themes explored here make you think about whose side you really want to take, and while Marvel pushes Captain America's right wing \"uncompromised freedom\" angle, the Hydra's \"freedom in order\" was very interesting. I hated the first Captain America movie, but the way this one was put together made this possibly the best super hero movie I've ever seen other than The Dark Knight Rises. The combination of the themes I mentioned above and the excellent action sequences made it a movie that included everything I love about movies. Robert Redford and Samuel L. Jackson deliver the standout performances here and some of their exchanges are just some of the best acting I've ever seen. I was also surprised by Chris Evans who I felt was the weakest link in the first movie. He plays this character, that I'm not exactly fond of, really well. The film also has one of the greatest villains in an action movie. The Winter Soldier is smart. He is an equal to the films protagonist and that's what made him so excellent. See this movie. If you have any interest in film, Marvel, politics, morality, or Captain America, this is a must see film.",

I had written them off as the lowest, cheapest form of  science fiction, and the first few Marvel films did little to prove me wrong, but then they started getting better, and arguably the best films in the franchise, or at least my favorites have been the Captain America films. Chris Evans is just terrific, he has this innocent naivet\u00e9 about him surrounded in a childlike wonderment, but when the time comes, he can still kick some ass and even crack a joke, Evans just fits the role like a glove. There's not much point summarizing the story, because if you're not into the whole Marvel scene, you're probably not going to understand or see this film anyway, and that's a shame, because from a visual stand point alone, The Winter Soldier rivals anything Marvel has put out to date. On that note, the one draw back to this film is there is a lot of Avenger story line involved. This is supposed to be a stand alone film, fans of the series loved it and rightfully so, but what about the people who just like the character and aren't into the whole genre? All the other Avenger/Shield/Hydra stuff and other characters from other series could make the story for them more than somewhat confusing. In watching this film, you almost have to have some kind of background knowledge of the characters involvement in other films in order to be in the know and that doesn't sit right with people, particularly kids, who just want to see Captain America. For the fans, however it doesn't get much better than this, it's slightly longer and rougher around the edges than The First Avenger, but it is still a great film, and a must see for anyone is trying to keep with the Marvel franchise.",

The Avengers honestly made Captain America look like a bench-warmer compared to the abilities of Hulk, Iron Man and Thor. This film emphasizes Cap's abilities and what he is truly capable of, and the best word to describe it: Redemption. I have always been far more a fan of super heroes I can connect to rather than how bad-ass they are. I love Iron Man, but he's such a screw-around playboy that I really cannot tell when his emotions are at stake and when he takes things seriously. I mean right after his near-death incident in Avengers, he suggested they go to a well-reviewed local diner. Don't get me wrong, they nailed Tony Stark's character and who he is, but who he is just is not completely similar to who I am. (I mean I was awarded class clown, but I have my morals). Steve Rogers has the most heart out of any avenger. He has a reason he wants to save people: \"I don't like bullies.\" This installment in the MCU holds a storyline I have fallen in love with. It makes it seem like Captain America is a true American hero via his exhibit at the Smithsonian, and one cannot help but feel his pain when he visits the now-aged Peggy. Great scene, great script, great acting. Captain America: The Winter Soldier KNOWS what it is about as well, unlike following Marvel Blockbuster \"The Amazing Spider-Man 2\". Captain America believes in freedom. He is the true definition of a hero, a savior, a leader, an avenger. Aside from the main plot of Hydra's diabolical schemes, the film's has such strong supporting characters. Scarlett Johanson is almost as comfortable as Black Widow as Downey Jr. is with Stark. She owns the role. Newcomer Falcon is likeable from the first minute of the film, and dear lord his stunts are cool. Samuel L. returns as director Fury with one of the best scenes in the film, had me on the edge of my seat the whole time, leading into the film's definitive villain, The Winter Soldier. Sorry to keep using examples from other films, but a simple comparison: Electro holds no meaning to Spider-Man, it would not matter if he were wiped off the face of the Earth, but when the hero has a personal and emotional connection to whom he is now threatened by, it simply makes for a better story and character chemistry. The Winter Soldier is another Bad-Ass to add to Marvel's collection of them. Another decent performance from Robert Redford is in the film as well, obviously not his best acting but he was not given many opportunities. No point in going into detail about his character, it is not a deal-breaker for this movie. The only real negative thing I can say is I got lost momentarily in the middle for a bit, a couple slow but very necessary scenes. Great follow up for Cap, I cannot wait for The Fallen Son.",

Chris Evans maintains his great character from The First Avenger, but now has to cope with a radically different world than the one he came from. Scarlett Johanssen finally gets enough screen-time to show that she can carry anything stand-alone Black Widow. Anthony Mackie finally gets a role where director's shadow does cover up his exceptional acting talent. Sam Jackson actually gets some moments to not just be Sam Jackson, but the genre-savvy character he implied to be since Iron Man 2. Sebastian Stan deserves praise for how well his screen presence carries given how much of it versus how little dialogue he actually has. Finally Robert Redford does well as Alexander Pierce, a character loaded with mystery who's a rabbit-hole you can't help but to look down. And warning; before you see any other new releases from Marvel Studios (save for Guardians of the Galaxy), see this first. This film also maintains the shift to darker tones that we've also seen in the other Phase II films released (Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World).

Ci sono cos\u00ec i film dedicati ai singoli personaggi che si intrecciano con i momenti \u2018collettivi\u2019 raccolti sotto il marchio degli Avengers richiamandosi gli uni con gli altri in una sorta di unico, grande filone narrativo contrassegnato da azione a palate, un tocco di humour e colonna sonora tonitruante (qui di Henry Jackman), il tutto per la delizia degli appassionati: categoria a cui non appartengo, ma ogni film sta in piedi da solo pure per chi non afferra i rimandi e anche questo regala intrattenimento ben fatto e, nel suo genere, efficace. Se siamo lontani dai momenti migliori del cinema di supereroi \u2013 spesso l\u2019Uomo Ragno oppure l\u2019ultimo Batman \u2013 la pellicola dei fratelli Russo ha comunque qualche buona freccia al suo arco e le due ore e un quarto scorrono quasi senza intoppi. Fatta la tara sugli inevitabili effetti speciali che allungano un po\u2019 il brodo specie nell\u2019interminabile finale \u2013 ma, si legge qua e l\u00e0, si \u00e8 cercato di ridurre quanto possibile la grafica al computer in favore di un approccio \u2018analogico\u2019 \u2013 emerge una struttura della storia, pi\u00f9 complessa della media, che prende a prestito in abbondanza dal thriller spionistico con una serie di disvelamenti e cambi di prospettiva che colpiscono nel segno. La S.H.I.E.L.D. \u2013 la struttura sovranazionale che fa da poliziotto del mondo e nelle cui fila milita anche l\u2019ipersoldato Steve Rogers, alias Capitan America \u2013 si cova in seno le uova del drago depositate dall\u2019arci-nemica Hydra, di derivazione nazista: tocca a Rogers, insieme a pochi amici fidati, correre contro il tempo perch\u00e9 il piano di controllo mondiale pensato dai cattivi non sia posto in essere e, allo stesso tempo, lottare contro un combattente altrettanto dotato che proviene dal suo passato. Da notare come, malgrado il clima sia senza dubbio Stati-Uniti-centrico, il progetto Insight sia, al tirar delle somme, una sorta di estremizzazione del concetto di \u2018guerra preventiva\u2019: in ogni caso, il fatto che l\u2019avversario sia quasi del tutto \u2018in casa\u2019 consente agli sceneggiatori Christofer Markus e Stephen McFeely di giocare al \u2018nulla \u00e8 come appare\u2019 infilando un buon numero di colpi di scena opportunamente dosati per evitare i momenti di stanca. A rimetterci, in una struttura siffatta, sono gli aspetti di contorno, tanto \u00e8 vero che l\u2019umorismo \u00e8 meno presente rispetto a pellicole simili - il personaggio di SamWilson/Falcon (Anthony Mackie) ne ha quasi l\u2019esclusiva \u2013 e poco sfruttato \u00e8 lo spaesamento di Rogers, addormentatosi ai tempi della Guerra Fredda e risvegliatosi ai giorni nostri. Fra una sequenza di botti e i numerosi combattimenti a mani nude (alcuni dei quali coreografati come in un film orientale, ad esempio quello iniziale tra il Capitano e Batroc), gli attori ci mettono il mestiere e danno l\u2019impressione di divertirsi, a partire da Redford che fa il cattivo per la prima volta in vita sua regalando il suo volto meravigliosamente stropicciato dalle rughe al perfido Pierce (non \u00e8 uno spoiler, lo si sapeva prima che il film uscisse). Samuel L. Jackson \u00e8 burbero come di consueto nei panni di un Nick Fury di non si sa quanto sottile doppiezza (trovando anche il modo di citare Ezechiele, 25:17) mentre l\u2019ormai onnipresente Johansson regala poco al personaggio forse pi\u00f9 fuori fuoco, ovvero la Vedova Nera. Fra di loro si muove, nei panni del protagonista, un palestratissimo Chris Evans che, forse per colpa del ciuffettino biondo, tende un po\u2019 al bambolotto e risulta lontanissimo, in tutti i sensi, dall\u2019ombroso (anti-)eroe appena ammirato in \u2018Snowpiercer\u2019. Quando, infine, i buoni trionfano, il film si premura di ricordarci la serialit\u00e0 di cui sopra con una scena dopo la prima parte dei titoli di coda disegnati in uno stilosissimo bianco e nero (quelli di testa, come da moda del momento, non esistono) e con un\u2019altra sequenza, molto pi\u00f9 breve, alla fine del rullo \u2013 ma ci vuole davvero tanta pazienza per arrivarci.",

WW2 always works.   but this movie was flat.  i can't tell the difference between this and gi joe or transformers.  they all play the same.  it needs more dialogue and foundation. When the action starts I don't care about the characters and when it finishes I still don\"t care. sure you root for the good guys but there is no mythos.  nazis have a similar mythos to the evil empire in star wars. a polarizing force which separates good and bad.  this movie  falls short. i'll keep watching but just not as enjoyable as ironman.  capt is played so one dimensional.",

I was surprised at how brutal the action was, but in a good way.  Usually Marvel tries to sugar coat it a little too much.  It's all very exciting and surprisingly well done, but I do have a few qualms.  The action isn't nearly as grounded in reality as Nolan's Batman trilogy, and the plot doesn't delve quite as deeply into the dark side of humanity either.  Also, towards the end, the action packed climax did begin to bore me a little bit.  It was just a little too repetitive with the massive explosions and people falling.  Overall however, the movie still emerges as one of the smartest, most viscerally thrilling, and engaging films of the genre, which when considering the endless supply of examples to chose from, is no small feat.",

The quite smart Marvel movie kept me entertained throughout with the usual Marvel action and Marvel jokes. Though again the CAWS had a lot of differences like SHIELD conspiracies, a this spy vs spy game, and genocide. It was a much darker version of what the Marvel movie shells out every years and this was quite rewarding. Most Marvel movies haven't shown people actually dying, but we just assumed they died off screen. This one however gives us a glimpse of people being killed.",

Like the Osterman Weekend, if you will, with superheroes. Not that I am against a film having a story. But the story in this film kind of defies logic. I have read reviews about how great the character of the Winter Solider is, and how he is the best Marvel villain since Loki. I call bullsh#t on that, as the best Marvel villains, imho, are Loki at the top, followed by Doc Ock from Spider-Man 2 and Magneto from X-Men: First Class. Hell, I would go as far as saying even Sebastian Shaw from First Class was a better villain than Winter Soldier. Here is simply akin to the Terminator, showing up when he is called for and then laying waste to all around him. It doesn't require much acting for that, just a strong physical presence, which he does deliver. But no more than Kurst The Undying in Thor: Dark World, a much superior film to this. It had enough going for it that I didn't totally hate it, but at the same time, I expected a lot more from it. I don't blame the actors, as they are all good with the roles they play. I blame a mediocre script with some plot holes I just found difficult to believe. And I am usually way more forgiving than this.",

      "text": "Decent and well-made marvel movie. I was slightly impressed by this movie more than the last because of my dislike towards the first. But what surprised me was how correlation and connection that they had with the first movie. This one reminded us about a lot of the stuff that went on the first movie and even a little bit of the avengers. Marvel has been really successful in the past and what they need is some connection with other marvel characters from their own movies. I really loved the references toward other obvious marvel characters like Iron Man and even Doctor Strange! I know that Doctor Strange doesn't even have his own movie yet but it gave me goosebumps. Anyways, the movie was very confusing most of the time. Nearly half way through the movie, nothing was explained and you had no idea what was going on. I was also very pissed off at the bad guys. Well I guess that makes sense because of when we finally get to see them get it handed to them at the end like every other marvel or action movie. What I really did like was how little CGI they used to perform these stunts which is a plus. But what wasn't so great was that you couldn't exactly see the actors doing everything. There was a minimum usage of shaky cam to mask the fact that the actors weren't really doing these stunts. I wasn't sure if they were actually doing the stunts but I was glad there wasn't really much CGI. So I thank the directors for that. Another plus was the character of Sam Wilson, who is Falcon. He had a great character and I was excited to see him in his scenes which he always owned. He was a great addition to the film and it was cool to see Cap with Falcon as they were teamed up in the comics. It was an entertaining movie. It has made me interested in Captain America more than the first one even though I have never been that big of a fan of his character. There was a lot of \"WHAT?!\" and confusing moments in this movie but it was somewhat resolved up towards the end. I'm not going to use the term \"overrated\" but I didn't think this movie was that great as everyone thought since everyone thinks so highly of Captain America nowadays. But a decent movie. No spoilers but a really cool ending credits scene tease that got me really hype.",

While the premise looks formidable on paper; the final product is as bland as they come - packaged and sealed for mass production by the Marvel Factory. Director\u2019s Anthony and Joe Russo, took very little artistic risks when making this film: channeling extensive, inelegant action scenes, and action movie clich\u00e9s that make this film predictable and anti-climatic. From the fake deaths to the real villain masquerading as a good guy for the first half of the movie, this film\u2019s got it all! Like most of the other films made by Marvel, this one simply feels like a stepping stone for the next big movie; possessing very little impact as a standalone feature. As such, it feels like another irrelevant entry in the franchise, that\u2019s bound to cash in at the box office. But I can\u2019t begrudge it for making the big bucks, it does offer some mild entertainment; and it feels fair to commend the studio for their win streak, in that regard. However, I remain largely unimpressed by this movie; and yearn for something boldly creative from the studio\u2026 not since \u2018Iron Man\u2019 (2008), have I truly been smitten.",

An unexpected story with larger roles for characters such as Nick Fury and Black Widow that definitely sets a new standard for future marvel films. My only concern about the movie is that I found the Winter Soldier to have less screen time than he deserved, especially since he was a very good villain that challenged Captain America both physically and mentally. I found that his character was the second best Marvel villain ever seen, only topped by the superb acting and writing for the character 'Loki.'",

His morals as a man of WWII honor and dignity definitely contrast from the outlook on war and politics to that of a character from the present such as Nick Fury which is something I really thought was needed for the movie. Another standout performance was from Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow, for which she portrays very well just like she's done since Iron Man 2.

      "text": "Fun. Action-packed. Derivative of past attempts and somewhat predictable. You know this. Unlike the first Captain America, Chris Evans seems to finally accept his role as Cap. Look up his interviews where he states he rejected the role nearly a dozen times and was effectively \"forced\" to play Cap. It shows in the first film where he looks like a pretty boy who doesn't want to do his job. Now, he looks like a pretty who totally digs his job. Maybe the bonuses from the Avengers being the second highest grossing film of all time has given him extra motivation to actually commit to an iconic role instead of getting by on his looks. George Clooney, I'm looking at you. The film was flawlessly edited although I am getting sick of these directors with their unprofessional shaky cam. I can understand shaky cam for the action scenes because these are actors and not martial artists, poor Georges St. Pierre had to wear training wheels and go easy on Evans, but even the mall sequence of hiding in plain sight had shaky cam. Seriously, film school drop out or just pandering to hyperactive dubstep loving tweens? Either way, it gives this X-Millenial a minor headache an adversely affects my enjoyment of an otherwise highly entertaining Marvel Studios film. Winter Soldier can't act for squat and his reliant on visual effects. Last but not least, someone tell Johanssen to take voice lessons. It's bad enough she's slow as molasses in her fight scenes, she requires the most amount of shaky cam and quick cuts to hide her lack of athleticism similar to Uma Thurman in Kill Bill, but her voice is so throaty it sounds like she's strangling herself every time she speaks. Take.A.Darn.Voice.Lesson. Learn to speak from your diaphgragm and not your trachea. Learn to give a speech in case you actually win an award. Lastly, the elevator scene was my favorite part. Evans truly shows his commitment when he asks if anybody wants to leave while surrounded by goons. I can't wait for Captain America 3.",

I thought this movie was gonna be all about Bucky Barns (who is the Winter Soldier by the way). This movie doesn't focus on the villain as the title suggest, but it focusses a lot on SHIELD and Nick Fury and Captain America's relationship. This isn't a bad thing, as it adds a lot to what we know about SHIELD itself. It also has a lot of Captain America shield action, and him fighting stuff (which is always cool). Also, the acting and tone of the movie is really good. It was dark and gritty, and it felt a lot like a spy type movie. It didn't feel one bit like a comic book movie, unfortunately. It took a lot from the pages of the Dark Knight, but I thought the realism was too extreme. In a world where the Hulk exists, you don't have to do that. The plot was also really confusing and hard to follow along with. Overall, the action sequences were great, and the tone and acting were both outstanding. I loved Black Widow and Falcon as supporting characters as well.  Unfortunately, it was confusing and at times a bit slow. The good still out-weighs the bad, and a 8/10 is a fair score.  It is the best Marvel phase 2 movie so far, and it challenges Iron Man 1 as a the best movie in the Avengers world besides the Avengers itself.",

It delivered simply a solid movie about a super hero that isn't all flash (no pun intended) and gloss. Hard to do these days. A usable plot coupled with moral dilemma was a good angle. I'm not majorly impressed with the acting or the scale of the movie though. Wouldn't a problem this big like probably get some of the other Avengers involved? The more important ones? Just sayin. Marvel's taking over and there's not much we can do except hope they can stay consistent. Not all of them are great but this one is worth a watch.",

Personally, I'm getting ready for Civil War next month by watching The Winter Soldier, and if the next Captain American movie is as good as this one, there's nothing to worry about. In The Winter Soldier, Steve Rodgers is trying to adjust to the modern world until a conspiracy involving SHIELD comes to light, but Cap also has to team up with Black Widow to battle another threat: The Winter Soldier. To me, Captain America has always been the most interesting Avenger because of how he was forced to leave behind his old life and friends, especially his old lover Peggy Carter, and adjust to life in the 21st century. It allows him to be more than just a roided-up superhero with a cool shield, and his struggle with readjustment is explored well in this movie. He also has to deal with a myriad of other significant issues like SHIELD and the Winter Soldier. The political conspiracy plot in particular adds a lot of suspense and twists to the story to make it consistently thrilling while the Winter Soldier provides a lot of great action sequences. His character is mysterious throughout the film, and he's definitely one of the better Marvel movie villains. Captain America: The Winter Soldier should certainly please even the most casual comic book movie viewer with its intense action, great plot and witty writing. I think I might need to binge watch all the MCU movies before Infinity War comes out next year.",

Next, he assembled with some other Superheroes to save the world from the disgruntled brother of a fellow Avenger. In Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Cap faces off against an internal threat and an organization that is just as powerful as S.H.I.E.L.D, as well as a familiar face and new adversary from his past. Life is rough for Cap. On top of everything, he is still trying to find a way to successfully assimilate himself into present day society. You think saving the world is hard? Try figuring out the internet, getting back on the dating scene, and making new friends at the age of ninety-five. Thankfully, there are only a few things Cap needs to get through the day; his trusty vibranium shield and his handy notepad with a slew of suggestions for catching up with the last seventy years, and Cap is ready to take on the world\u2013or corrupt government organizations. Either or, Cap is always ready to save the day, even if he has to take a beating while doing it.",

      "text": "Captain America: The winter soldier explains to us what Cap has been doing since the Avengers. Firstly, this movie could be considered marvel's best, with Its epic action sequences and great acting. Also what made it great was the fantastic plot and great CGI. The supporting characters are great, especially Falcon and Black Widow. The winter soldier is also a decent marvel villain, and the comedy is pretty good too. However, even a fantastic movie can still have flaws. Firstly, despite me saying it had a fantastic plot, the plot can get slightly confusing at times especially for your average movie viewer. The main villain: Alexander Pearce is another average marvel villain and the film can get a little lifeless at times. However I believe that Captain America: the winter soldier is the definitive marvel movie and might always be the definitive marvel movie.",

      "text": "In a year when I was hyped to see The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (Trust me its day is coming). i was blown away by how much effort and how thought provoking the subject manner is. This is Marvels version of \"The Dark Knight\"  as it dives into subjects that very few superhero stories go to. Captain America is conflicted with his role as an American icon as he realizes that the America he fought for in World War II is not the same America as it is today. He figures out that America is more secretive than it was in its earlier days and his ideals are challenged like Batman before him. Every pearson he knows is either dead or withering away in their old age which makes the character have a tragic backstory but he still has a sense of optimism that few other heroes have. This is the film that made me realize why Captain America has lasted for so long. That is because he represents the ideals that America strives for and not necessarily it's Government. He is even challenged on a personal level when he is fought against his sole opposite the Winter Solider. Like the Captain, he is a solider that fights for his form of government but unlike his counterpart, he was forced into the experimentation which perfectalty reflects the major differences between the two forms of government. It is also a challenge when the Winter Solider was reveled to be Captain America's old war fiend Bucky Barnes. The revelation of Hydra pulling the strings in U.S politics might be seen as silly but it is a nice allegory statement about how America has become more fascist as it is about to kill innocent people for things that they might do instead of what they would actually do. Said reveal is so intriguing and so mind boggling that it reminded me of the interaction between Raiden and the Patriot A.Is from \"Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty\". In fact both stories have very similar themes. The only problems that I have is that I wish the Winter Solider was more developed and the \"death\" of Nick Fury had no emotional weight because I knew they would never kill him off. Despite this the film is full of political intrigue and action sequences are spectacular to see and it is a film that adds to the universe.",
