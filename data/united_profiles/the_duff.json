The film captures life, I mean the characters, and I'm mostly refering to Wesley (Robbie Amell) and Bianca (Mae Whitman), are realistic, humanized. I got a weird sense that I was watching people I knew and not a stereotypical film version of them. The movie has that documentary feel to it and it's due to how the leads portrayed their characters and how easy it is to relate to them.",

The main reason I went to see this one is I loved Mae Whitman in \"Parenthood\" as I think she is a great little actress, and bingo I guessed right as she pulls this movie off in a grand way.  Actually it is well written minus all the stupid humor injected unnecessarily, does have some meaning to it for either if you are old or young, and Mae's supporting cast does a good job as the glue to make it all fit.  There is humor, humor that made me laugh, but humor that wasn't over the top!!  This I think this should be added to the list of great teen movies.  Well done Bravo Ari Sandel who is the director, hope we get to see more from you in the future as you got this one right!!  Thanks for all your effort and again well done!!  Was an enjoyable evening at the movies.",

Robbie Amell was also really good which we doesn't always expect from the good looking love interest guy. This film conquers some teen issues that are apparent in high schools today and I'm sure a lot of young adults will be able to make connections to this movie and that will be what makes it special.",

One of them says that it has a draggy tone. In my opinion the Duff shows the mindset of a teenage female in high school. Me and Bianca are so similar yet so different. We both are considered fat, but we do not have the same wideness. We also have a difficulty getting a boyfriend, or having a boy like us. Another bad review for this wonderful movie is that someone called it exceptionally Dumb. Even though it is supposed to be like the book but it is not like it really that much. In the end of both of them she ends up getting the womanizer/playboy Wesley Rush. In the end of the year i will probably not have a boyfriend like Bianca.",
