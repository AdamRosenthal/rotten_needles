The movie was really funny; it had a bunch of scenes where I laughed hard. This really worked so well mostly because of Mae Whitman, who plays \"the DUFF\". She's a great actress, and she acts like any normal teenager would with just a slight awkwardness and a lot of sarcasm and heart. The movie even slips in some lessons on cyberbullying and just being yourself, but it's never preachy about it. The morals are worked in smoothly. It's definitely a huge surprise to me that I liked The DUFF so much, and I would recommend this to all of you.",

I am looking for comedy without borders, but DUFF keeps it in the borders, when I look for acting, I find Bella Thorne, which is really not amusing. But, it was fresh, original and admittedly, funny. This is a film that climbes up the ladder of High School dramedies and becomes a total king of them. The dialogue is sharp and brilliantly written, while the starpower make for some interesting acting skills. The DUFF is a witty film, that is funny enough to hold your attention.",

The main reason I went to see this one is I loved Mae Whitman in \"Parenthood\" as I think she is a great little actress, and bingo I guessed right as she pulls this movie off in a grand way.  Actually it is well written minus all the stupid humor injected unnecessarily, does have some meaning to it for either if you are old or young, and Mae's supporting cast does a good job as the glue to make it all fit.  There is humor, humor that made me laugh, but humor that wasn't over the top!!  This I think this should be added to the list of great teen movies.  Well done Bravo Ari Sandel who is the director, hope we get to see more from you in the future as you got this one right!!  Thanks for all your effort and again well done!!

Robbie Amell was also really good which we doesn't always expect from the good looking love interest guy.

We both are considered fat, but we do not have the same wideness. We also have a difficulty getting a boyfriend, or having a boy like us. Another bad review for this wonderful movie is that someone called it exceptionally Dumb. Even though it is supposed to be like the book but it is not like it really that much.
