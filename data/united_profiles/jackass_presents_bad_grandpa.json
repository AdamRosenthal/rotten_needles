Whether it's Irv going to a strip club and almost getting punched out by a male stripper, passing his grandson off as a girl so they can crash a kiddie beauty contest, or trying to transport and dispose of his late wife's body, Bad Grandpa offers plenty of situations where the hidden cameras capture the varied and hilarious responses of onlookers. There are times when it seems several of these surprised viewers must be plants, and you do find yourself questioning the legitimacy of some of these \"candid\" moments. Still, it's funny as hell. The range of reactions (when you're not wondering who's a plant and what bit was probably scripted) range from the amused to the utterly horrified. It's amazing how much craziness people will put up with until they've finally had enough. The movie's biggest surprise is how sweet it can be at times. You come to legitimately care about Irv and Billy and are invested in how their journey together turns out and if they can work out their relationship. There's a set-piece in a biker bar near the end that's surprisingly touching (albeit in-between set-ups and pay-offs to different gags). Knoxville and Niccol have great chemistry together; the movie simply wouldn't work if they didn't. Niccol is a real find. He seems like a real kid rather than a \"movie kid.\" With his hangdog countenance and deadpan manner, Niccol comes across like a little Walter Matthau. The Jackass gang strike again with the giddily gonzo Bad Grandpa, featuring Johnny Knoxville's Irv Zisman at his most gloriously inappropriate.",

Johnny Knoxville disguises himself as 86-year-old Irving Zisman and takes a road trip with his 8-year-old grandson (Jackson Nicholl, who's already an amazingly confident and gifted comic presence). They play out the simple narrative in real places with real people getting involved and reacting to the outrageous things that Zisman does. The laffs are plentiful, as long as you're amused by gross bodily functions, genital humor and irreverent situations. Despite the craziness, Knoxville's talent as an actor adds realism and emotion to this expedition in crazy excess. Think Jackass meets Candid Camera.",

      "text": "Bad Grandpa has some undeniably funny moments. However after the plot is presented in the start of the movie, the movie begins forgetting about it. This makes the movie feel incomplete, as if it hasn't accomplished what it set out to do. The bond that the movie tries to develop between Bad Grandpa and his grandson (Billy) starts off slowly, very slowly. This is because numerous scenes during the first half of the movie are following the tales of the individual characters, not the duo. This makes the second half of the movie, where they begin to bond at a much greater level, appear rushed and unrealistic. Even with the leniency that people give comedy movie plots, Bad Grandpa's feels mediocre at best, appearing rushed and distracted from its purpose. The comedy in this movie is also a bit dodgy. This movie has moments, but it goes too far with individual comedy acts. It's like the writers went \"well we can't think of anything else funny, so we'll shove this one joke down the audience's throats for 15 minutes.\" It's a shame because a lot of these jokes are really funny at first, but after the first few times, it makes the movie seem desperate for one more laugh. Unfortunately, a lot of scenes in the movie aren't funny at all, and excessively immature. These moments make you frown as you shy away from the screen, as they're way more disturbing than they are funny. These scenes also go on for way too long. Bad Grandpa is a film that starts really slowly, with the jokes feeling very forced, but manages to recover quite well, picking up the pieces to form a film that contains several meaningful laughs, as well as being able to witness the bond that Grandpa and Billy share.",

That being said it still does have the felling a jackass movie same old laughs with Johnny Knoxville doing crazy stunts. It may not be the movie that all fans of Jackass wanted but i thought it turned out better then when i first heard about it. Making a whole movie about one skit from the previous Jackass films who would have thought it would have turned out this good.",

Bad Grandpa, story wise is nothing to write home about, however it will leave you in fits on laughter. They have done a really good job with getting the reactions of so called \"randoms\", which makes the movie all the funnier! The pranks are golden! Very recommendable.",

      "text": "Moving in another direction for their fourth film, the producers of Jackass decided to focus on a single character from the franchise, Johnny Knoxville's Irving Zisman. The film has everything you've come to expect from the series, as Knoxville plays a Grandfather, on vacation with his Grandson. Knoxville does his usual schtick, crashing into to things, saying outrageous things to strangers, and of course showing off his giant rubber testicles. As with most of the Jackass stuff, it's outrageous and hilarious for the first half hour, but quickly gets old. Maybe I'm just too old to appreciate Jackass anymore, but when I start out watching one of their films, I love it, and by the end, I'm just waiting for it to be over with. Knoxville is impressive, and while he's done films on his own, I think he was giving a message to the rest of the group in this film. The message being, if you guys don't want to do this anymore, I can make it work with anyone, even a 10 year old kid. Hopefully the message gets through and we'll get some more Jackass films. I really do love the simplistic comedic genius of the films, but it's repetitive nature makes anything more than an episode of the show wear on me. Maybe it's just not made for someone in my age group anymore, but regardless of age, Jackass has always been good for a few laughs and Bad Grandpa is no exception.",
