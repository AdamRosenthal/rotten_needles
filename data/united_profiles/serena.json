      "text": "Coming out of a time when the law ruled less than a man's conscience, and a poor man's wages were as valuable as were the trees that the ruling class wanted to protect, so we find George Pemberton and Serena.  Together, they become a rock solid team:  partners as much as lovers, to many men's guarded disapproval,  especially that of Pemberton's old and dear friend, Buchanan, whose life proves to be the first chink in the couple's armor.  The rather alluring and human aspects of this story, is about that armor, and what holds it together.  Each character has their own personal ambitions and demons.  In an opposing yet matrimonial way, they each resemble the other in this way.  Pemberton learns of Serena's demons, full of death and ash, as he watches her ride a horse, looking totally alive and beautiful; Serena learns of George's demon the moment they step onto the North Carolina property, and a rather earthly, somewhat homely woman with a round belly is staring back at both of them.  While their passions collide, there is a foreboding feeling that we, nor they, will ever get a glimpse of Brazil. This tale runs only as deep as the person watching it, that is, you must be in the right space to allow yourself to go down this road.  Taking away from it that no matter how strong you make a bond, that same bond is as weak as the weakest link becomes (and hoping for recovery during the movie), but truly realizing in this that we all, ultimately will live, and die alone, with our very selves, meaning, our choices, our sins, our losses, our gains, and left to wonder which ones were worth the risk and which ones we should have risked more for... I thought of that as Pemberton watches the train holding his child move away from him, separating them eternally.  Finding that narrative within while watching the movie will indeed make it all the richer an experience and leave you thoughtful afterward.  If a movie can unnerve you a bit, of course you must be willing to allow that, then I'm sure the writer, directors, and actors would feel they have done well.  If a movie can become a full discussion over an evening amongst family or friends that widens the scope to real questions about time, life, change, and where our weaknesses lie then it deserves to be commended.  I forgot these were the same actor and actress from \"Silver Linings Playbook\" and \"American Hustle\" as well!  Points off because despite its richness in those 109 minutes, it isn't a movie that I want to add to my permanent library as it is unnecessary to go back and watch again and again in order to find anything a second or third time, nor do I really care to visit those feelings, while very moving, again with the same movie.",
