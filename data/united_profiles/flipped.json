There's just something about the way it ends or the way that its brought out that makes me just want to keep watching and gain an incredible interest in Juli and Bryce's life. This movie will stick with me and be watched for a long time.",

      "text": "Flipped achieved one great thing, and that is to produce a feeling on me. At the end of the day that is one of the most important things that movies should ultimately accomplish and aim for. This movie presents one of the most ironical but true love stories that can touch many if not everybody in some way or another. Granted, it could be a bit heavy at times given its structure. Flipped interludes between the two main character's perspective on each of the several situations that they cross upon, and that opens the gate for a lot of repetition which can be a little frustrating. But overall, Flipped couldn't have been any other way; it successfully reaches so much depth because of this enduring but intriguing concept. At the end, this movie takes you back to the days of the first true love, and also to the days that resembled the meaning of what it was to be young.",

This was one of my best movies of 2010 by far! Rob Reiner done a fantastic job! The movie has the 'Stand By Me' feel!!! It was a really cute love story!

Oh, and another thing, WWWAAAAAAAAAYYYYYY too much narration. However if there is one good thing about this, it's the music. It has a nice 60s soundtrack to accompany it's setting, but other than that it's terrible. Open your minds, people. This is junk!",
