The film is interesting, not too heavy, but delivered a healthy good news. Dolly has been a long time, I like, I almost forgot how much fun she can. Hope for the whole family can take away the noise from the joy of the message. Who knows the Queen Latifia can sing so wonderful? This is an all-star cast of talented young people, a witty twist, a great, from start to finish optimism.",

It is more cliche than anything I've seen from Disney.  A 3 minute song that simply says \"fix me Jesus\" is nauseating.  Dolly's corny remembrancewith Kris made me roll my eyes.  The voices in the movie sing wonderfully.  However, the camp and cornball littered with an obvious plug for churches made even the heartwarming moments Gravol-ready.  The voices keep this movie from being rated a 1.  Wait for late night TV for this one folks.",

It was REALLY loud in my theatre and this also took away from the enjoyment.  On another note, I just could not get past the vast amount of cosmetic changes in Dolly Parton's face and her inability to show basic emotions, especially during close up shots.  She has had one too many botox injections and lip stuffings.  It really took away from her performance and could have added so much to the sensitive plots if she could have really acted. On another note, some of the music was nice but seemed a mix-mash of different genres.  Dolly had to get a few of her songs in the movie so this did not necessarily mesh with the gospel theme.",

Queen Latifah and Dolly Parton make for formidable opponents, but their clashes never go for the throat and come off as subdued. The plot is also really predictable, almost groan-inducing.
