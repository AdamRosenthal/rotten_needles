      "text": "I'll be honest, I only bothered watching this movie because of Rachel Bilson. However, it was not at all the chick flick I expected it to be. Actually, I would say that it's not a chick flick at all. What it is is one of the saddest movies I've ever seen. Not sad in the \"Hachi\" or \"Green Mile\" sense where it's a tear-jerker because it had incredibly sad scenes. It's more sad in a depressing and realistic way where the foundation of the movie is essentially how life kinda sucks and is very hard and isn't all \"peachy\". Is there a love story mixed in? Sure, but there's a love story mixed into a lot of movies, TV shows, and even video games so I don't think \"love story = chick flick\" automatically. I thought the acting was solid, the story was very original and well told, and the development of the characters and plot was outstanding. The story was incredibly slow and I thought the ending of the movie went against what the purpose that the plot was all about so they kind of sold out there but it was still a solid movie. It's not great by any means of the imagination and most people might not have the patience to allow themselves to get wrapped up into the film but it's a much better movie than all of those soulless critics made it out to be.",
