It's also at least partially a mumblecore film, which I didn't even realise. Wiley Wiggins looks a lot different when he's not animated and 10 years older. So if you don't like that, you're probably not going to like this. And I think you'd have to know something about chess to get it, but probably not much. I'm not sure how much the director knows about chess, but he has one of the characters perform a knight tour, so I'm guessing at least something. (Actually the closest thing I'd probably compare it to is Look Around You, but slightly less surreal  at least at the start)",
