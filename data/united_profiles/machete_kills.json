This time around Machete is more like a super hero. He is sent on a mission to Mexico by the President (excellent choice of casting Charlie Sheen, using his birth name of Carlos Esteves). But other than that, (and of course Danny Trejo and Michelle Rodriquez), the rest of the cast just didn't fit. The schizo Mexican revolutionary didn't fit, Cuba was completely out of place, wasn't really feeling Lady Gaga or Amber Heard (even though she is gorgeous) and the gorgeous Sophia Vegara was just a little too manic. But it really wasn't that.. the film just was kind of flat, even the action scenes weren't clicking. Maybe because they gave away too much in the previews. Maybe its because they made Machete inhuman.. All I know is that when I was in the theater, 3 people around me fell asleep and 4 people walked out a hour after the film started...

They just don\u2019t kill Machete (Danny Trejo), whom you\u2019ll recall from the first film survived a shot to the head when the bullet was blocked by another bullet, already lodged in his skull. Machete Kills continues director/co-writer Robert Rodriguez\u2019s penchant for outrageous plot developments performed by \u201cwhat-the?\u201d casting choices. Mel Gibson plays a villain straight out of a Bond film  Moonraker, to be precise. Charlie Sheen (listed in the credits by his birth name, Carlos Estevez) follows in his father\u2019s footsteps as the U.S. President. And Lady Gaga is introduced as \u201cwhoever she wants to be.\u201d Name your box-office poison. If Fatty Arbuckle were still around, he\u2019d have a cameo for sure. Yet somehow, the results work. That\u2019s probably because Rodriguez takes nothing seriously. The plot  which could fit on the back of a cereal box, but only the really sugary kind  involves a Mexican madman (Oscar nominee Demian Bichir) who wants the U.S. to clean up the corruption in his country, or he\u2019ll fire a nuclear warhead at Washington. (Apparently he\u2019s been reading Madman Tactics for Dummies.) President Sheen, or Estevez, or whatever, calls on Machete to help. \u201cYou know Mexico,\u201d he tells the taciturn strongman. \u201cHell, you are Mexico.\u201d Helping him will be a government agent played by Amber Heard. Her cover identity is beauty pageant winner Miss San Antonio, but has the operative gone too deep into character? In one scene she texts Machete: CU There!   More about the story I cannot reveal. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m against spoilers; I just wasn\u2019t sure what was going on most of the time, although whatever it is, it\u2019s as funny as a roadrunner cartoon and only about 2.5 times as violent. Machete faces off against La Camale\u00f3n, a shape-shifting assassin played by a bewildering array of actors (Cuba Gaga Banderas Jr., etc). He crosses paths with Desdemona (Sofia Vergara), whose 32F brassieres pack a 38-calibre punch. (You\u2019ll never guess where she keeps her backup firepower.) He hooks up with former partner Luz (Michelle Rodriguez), who sports a sexy eye patch and has a feminist revolutionary poster on her wall that reads Sh\u00e9. And he makes use of a road-tunnel under the U.S.-Mexican border, stolen directly from 2009\u2019s Fast & Furious. The movie runs for 107 minutes but features a ticking-clock timeline that allows it to pack more into 24 hours than, well, 24. And it opens with a fake trailer for Machete Kills Again  In Space! At least, I think it\u2019s a fake trailer. You may recall that the first Machete sprang from just such a bogus teaser, attached to 2007\u2019s Grindhouse. So while Machete likes to say \u201cMachete don\u2019t\u201d lines  Machete don\u2019t smoke, tweet, joke, etc.  the one thing Machete seems destined to do is return.",

He's usually good at making B movies that poke fun at themselves but here B, stands for bad. Machete Kills is over the top goofy throughout. Even a kooky Mel Gibson with a Mad Max tribute scene can't save it.",

The deaths are fun the action is fun and luckily the film doesn't take itself seriously but simply not taking itself seriously doesn't make it good. Some of the characters are too irritating for too long and overshadow the action. But hey if you're looking to watch a film with a lot of cool gory deaths this movie is for you. If you're looking for anything else then not so much.",

      "text": "Isador Cortez, a.k.a. Machete, always had Danny Trejo\u2019s face since his first cameo in Robert Rodriguez\u2019s \"Spy Kids\" (2001), and has always been portrayed as an over-the-top caricature of the infallible action hero. His first sporadic appearances in different films were intended as Easter eggs and nod to the fans: the best known reference of all is the fake trailer included in \"Grindhouse\" (2007), by Tarantino and Rodriguez himself. It took Quentin\u2019s genius (but most of all his reputation) to raise the funds for a project that had been their forbidden desire for a long time: a so called \u201cb-movie\u201d, a low-budget exploitation film as in fashion in the \u201870s. Rodriguez jumped at the chance to give depth and notoriety to Machete, laying the foundations for what would later become the 2010 feature \u201cMachete\u201d, a critical, public and box office success.",

      "text": "Let me start off by saying love love love the first Machete. I can watch it anytime... This one, not so much. Robert Rodriquez swung for the fences with this one and it missed. Some people will never ever say anything bad about the guy and some will genuinely like it, but to be honest.. it just didn't have that X factor the first Machete did. This time around Machete is more like a super hero. He is sent on a mission to Mexico by the President (excellent choice of casting Charlie Sheen, using his birth name of Carlos Esteves). But other than that, (and of course Danny Trejo and Michelle Rodriquez), the rest of the cast just didn't fit. The schizo Mexican revolutionary didn't fit, Cuba was completely out of place, wasn't really feeling Lady Gaga or Amber Heard (even though she is gorgeous) and the gorgeous Sophia Vegara was just a little too manic. But it really wasn't that.. the film just was kind of flat, even the action scenes weren't clicking. Maybe because they gave away too much in the previews. Maybe its because they made Machete inhuman.. All I know is that when I was in the theatre, 3 people around me fell asleep and 4 people walked out a hour after the film started... AND it wasn't that many people in the theatre. Gosh I wanted it to be so much better.. This is a rental, at best.",
