It was a stupid idea to make a movie focusing on abuse, rape, sexual harassment, and acts of violence. There's nothing new to the party including a bland script, weak characters, a dose of a slasher flick meets a undetermined thriller movie, and nothing else comes close. I'm really sorry but don't see it. Women who were abused doesn't need to see this gruesome and sometimes disturbing movie alone.",
