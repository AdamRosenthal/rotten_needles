Plot aside, the structure, filming and acting were so low quality it would have shelved before airing by the Lifetime/hallmark channel  if it was made for TV . As for the \"plot\" , it is nothing more than \"I am a victim\" fetishism.  There is no Christian message . With all the places in the world where people are persecuted, fueling paranoia about a non existent threat is a waste. I hope and pray that anyone who liked this movie examines their life, and seek help.",
