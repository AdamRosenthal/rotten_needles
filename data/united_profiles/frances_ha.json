How did Francois Truffaut tackle the same terrain of sexual politics, as portrayed in Kissing Jessica Stein? The narrator, in Jules and Jim, recalls how \"people called them Don Quixote and Sancho Panza,\" and that \"rumors circulated behind their backs about their unusual friendship.\" Although Jules puts the kibosh on Jim's pursuance of Catherine, whom we presume to be his lover par excellence, we later learn, after both men return from war, that their marriage is marked by celibacy. Sabine looks nothing like her father, Jim notes. Catherine's satiation, Jules admits, comes from other lovers. When he hands over Catherine without any hesitation or qualms, it's because the cuckolded husband apprizes his best friend's platonic love as being on par with his wife's feminine powers. Bi-curious Jessica, ultimately, doesn't covet women, and yet, bawls her eyes out over Helen's departure as if she did. Whereas Jessica, and Jessica alone would subscribe to the notion that \"Jules' and Jim's friendship had no equivalent in love,\" Frances and Sophie take delight \"in the smallest things\" and accept \"their differences with tenderness,\" a shared sensibility that transcends love of all persuasions. Manhattan settings both, essentially, Frances Ha picks up where Kissing Jessica Stein leaves off, but here, there is no analogue for Helen, since both Frances and Sophie are randy heterosexuals. \"The coffee people are right. We are like a lesbian couple that doesn't have sex anymore,\" Frances says, sharing both cigarette, and inside joke, in regard to the careening apogee of their avowed sexual orientation. Modern love, indeed. Only David Bowie can explain them. When Frances' laptop light goes out, like a lover, Sophie stops the aspiring dancer from adjourning to her own room, and like a lover who nags about a partner's annoying little habits, she softly chastises Frances over her bad decorum, regarding socks in bed. Socks are the only piece of clothing she removes, which may surprise the viewer, since all of New York can see the uninhibited pair carrying on like Don Quixote and Sancho Panza. Alas, so who is Jules? And who is Jim? The film, it would seem, casts the titular character as Jules. Akin to the scene where Jim gives Catherine to his closest confidant, Frances, in a bequeathing of sorts, suggests that Sophie hook up with Lev, a roommate(one of her \"two husbands\", a Jules and Jim reference), which would reunite the Vassar graduates, turning the Manhattan apartment into something resembling her counterpart's crowded Austrian chalet. But Sophie, like Jim, already has a partner, and this is where Frances Ha diverges from the Jules and Jim template, since Frances' bespectacled friend remains loyal to Patch, whereas the German can't choose between Catherine and his fiancee. Frances, ever the martyr, rebuffs Lev's advances, because, perhaps, thinking ahead, she sees him as the key to luring Sophie back into her life, even though the Sacramento native thinks he's \"magic\". Back home for Christmas with family and friends, this transplanted New Yorker, now signified by tract housing instead of skyscrapers, and churchgoers instead of artists, seems less like a persona than a person, and more like a woman than a man. In NYC, she adopts the masculine role by paying for Lev's dinner, and also, Benji draws attention to her \"weird man walk\", suggesting that Frances is in drag, albeit less visibly than Catherine, who with chapeau and painted mustache, passes herself of as a man, one sunny day in France among the boys. Arguably, the scene where Frances teeters along the river Seine, the same river where Catherine jumps into, is not the first direct steal from Jules and Jim. While Frances' mother pounds on the bathroom door, the daughter lies down in the tub, more or less, underwater, which abstractedly recalls Catherine's drowning, when she drives, with Jim riding shotgun, off the dock. Like the similarly-themed Superbad, porn-lovin' Seth declares, \"I don't know what I'm going to be into ten years from now,\" the same ambiguity imbues itself in this familial exchange: \"Frances, how much longer?\" asks mom. \"I'll be out in a second,\" responds her adult child, or, maybe give it ten years. From an objective distance, Jules and Jim lock eyes, and for emphasis, the mis-en-scene freezes. What do the eyes say? In Frances Ha, the filmmaker instead employs close-ups and a shot/countershot during the climactic staring, following Frances' first show as a choreographer. We can see. What are we seeing?",

This is a witty character study about Frances Frances Halladay (Greta Gerwig), a 27-year-old dancer who lives with her best friend Sophie. When Sophie decides to move out, leaving Frances low and dry, Frances is forced to figure out how to live her life. Not to take things too personally, but as 20-something year-old I can\u2019t help but relate with some of the difficulties faced by the titular character and that struggle to get started on life. While this is clearly a Noah Baumbach film, I think equal credit should be given to star and co-scribe Greta Gerwig. Her contribution to the indie-film realm these past few years have been felt and her presence here couldn\u2019t be any stronger. The shear level of wit, sincerity and (most of all) charisma that she brings to her character was truly something special; and should not be taken lightly. Drawing from the French New Wave and Woody Allen (mainly during the 70\u2019s) Baumbach crafts a deliciously stylized film that tells the story in an utterly unique fashion. The black and white cinematography does so well at setting the bleak tones that comes with a quarter-life crises, and I could listen to the soundtrack all day long. Sometimes funny and sometimes heartbreaking; I\u2019m really hoping this gem doesn't go unnoticed by year end. The film has such an appeal and deserves all the attention in the world.",

However this proves more difficult for Frances as she is an interesting and lovable train wreck. Unlike director Noah Baumbach's previous film, the intolerably boring Greenberg, Frances Ha has a lead character who sure takes some getting used to with her indecipherable rants and her illogical sense of self, but isn't an insufferable presence who only gets more despicable. It's a film about self awareness and the ability to know your own self worth and therefore it has a wonderful yet lifelike conclusion anyone who watches will be happy with. While the first act is all over the place, its only to highlight Frances' hyperactive personality and her inability to be still and settle down. The film really comes into its own when Frances is forced to make plans because Frances in trouble is both hilarious and tragic making for a compelling watch. Gerwig is fantastic and understands the effervescent nature of Frances as if it was her. Something this film makes very easy to believe. Peppered with interesting side characters to round out Frances' surprisingly large friend circle (especially for someone as high maintenance as she is), the film is equal parts unusual comedy and sombre drama as we cling to the words coming out of this self destructive yet brilliant woman.",

      "text": "Frances Ha is a charming little comedy-drama from director Noah Baumbach that certainly is easy to identify with given the struggles of the main character. Though she is certainly flawed, she has a feeling of being entirely real and authentic. Great Gerwig is fantastic, as is the rest of the cast, but Gerwig soaks up the screen and kills it the entire time. Truly plotless, Franches Ha could certainly be seen as being a touch pretentious by some, but I enjoyed it very much. It never drags and always engages you and makes you feel invested in the life of this girl who is in a bit of a rough patch of her life. However, as I said, it could certainly be called pretentious and you would have a leg to stand on. Making her attend Vassar College does not help this cause. However, on the whole, Frances Ha is a cute little film that really sweeps you in and charms you the entire time. This is the first film I have seen from Baumbach and it certainly underscores that I need to watch more.",

The black and white doesn't really fulfill the purpose and there's reason to believe it was chosen for budget rather than artistic value; anyway it's not annoying and Greta Gerwig's bulky, awkward character feels real notwithstanding the small plot holes (the mystery of how she can pay anything at all is left unveiled). Actually, I didn't find any of the characters to be very likeable, but I assume that's another take on recreating reality.",

I had no empathy whatsoever for Frances, who was annoying, if not depressing, to watch. There's no story here, really. So she ends up as a choreographer for a pretty embarrassingly bad dance scene at the end of the movie? Who cares? I wanted her to give up on her dream 20 minutes into the movie. What's the message here: we should all get sentimental over mediocrity? There were no depth to the characters, either. So surprised this came from Noah Baumbach!",
