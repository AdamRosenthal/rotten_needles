However, the incredibly strong character work, especially the central relationship between Arlo and Spot, carry the film over these rough patches and make it all work on a visceral emotional level without ever tipping into manipulation. It doesn't hurt that this is the most visually stunning work that Pixar has ever done. So, it won't live along side Toy Story, Up and Inside Out, but it's better than Cars.

On the one hand, it is one of the most technically impressive films the studio has done, with near photorealistic environments and incredible attention to detail in the characters. Furthermore, the characters are all, for the most part, quite memorable, and there are moments of excellent visual storytelling that match the studio's typical high mark in quality. At the same time, The Good Dinosaur has almost as many frustrating moments, where the plot falls into cliches, where the storytelling becomes on the nose and rushed, and where the bad parts often times stand out more, unfortunately, because of the glimmers of brilliance throughout. The Good Dinosaur still lives up to the name of being \"good\", but in a movie where it had the potential to be \"excellent\", I cannot say that I'm not slightly disappointed.",

As can be expected from a Pixar film, the animation was stunning. I'd even go as far as to say, it just might be one of their most visually amazing films to date. It wasn't as deep or groundbreaking as \"Inside Out\" but when you think about it, few movies are. The protagonists, Arlo and Spot were both very likeable and Sam Elliot gave a solid vocal performance as Butch the T-Rex. Speaking of T-Rexes, I think Pixar deserve some recognition for making him a good guy rather than a villain or an obstacle, like most dinosaur movies do. As well as visually stunning, the movie was quite emotional- which isn't surprising for a Pixar movie. So overall, while it lacks the complexity of previous Pixar films, The Good Dinosaur makes up for this with beautiful animation and heartfelt emotion.",

Presented in colorful photorealistic sets, it is visually stunning and there are certainly some beautiful scenes without any single dialogue, which effectively works well just like Wall-E, together with satisfying scores from academy awards winner Mychael Danna (Life of Pi). The adventure of grow and learn, cherishing family bonding and appreciating the value of friendship are the three major elements of usual Pixar's trademark, not only adorable, charming and family-friendly, but also emotionally engaging at certain times that might challenge audiences tear holding power.",

The film feels very formulaic and I became generally disinterested in it about 45 minutes in. It also has very simple themes which don't stand up, even in comparison to Pixar's worst films.

Thunderclap and his team of \"rescuers\" want to eat the caveman boy. That's pretty stupid, they have thousands of stray animals and just want to eat one. And 3- the designs of the characters they don't fit with the beautifusl and realistics backgrounds. Why they didn't do betters designs and look realistic as Dinosaur (2000)?. and I thought it would be the worst of Pixar, but it is not so bad. The backgrounds are beautiful, the voices are decent, the animation is good and the music is beautiful, but the problem of The Good Dinosaur is that don't feel like a Pixar film is more Disney.

The detail in the animation is jaw dropping.  Water has never looked more realistic.  There is great detail in all aspects of the film.  That brings up a dilemma with animation.  If you make a film too realistic looking, does it take away from the animation experience?  The characters throughout the film had an animated look which was a stark contrast to the realistic landscape.  The movie felt like Roger Rabbit at times, which used animated characters in a live action film.  The plot, overcoming and facing your fears, has been used in many animated films before, but it had another good storyline as well, not jumping to conclusions before you know all the facts.  Overall, I really enjoyed the movie.  I did not enjoy the short film that preceded the feature, however.",

My expectations were so low, in fact, that at times during the showing I was willing the film to be bad just so I didn't have to be the one with the unpopular opinion at the end of it. As many people have pointed out, the visuals of the movie are indeed beautiful, with vast rocky landscapes that could easily be confused for real live-action video footage from Canada were it not for the colourful jarring cartoon beasts roaming through them. Not long into the film, however, these landscapes quickly become the backdrop for our very likeable protagonists, Arlo and Spot.",

Overall, the story is touching and takes you on a (mostly) predictable ride, where the settings look extremely realistic.

However there were some unnecessary elements in the film, that would have made the film much more simple if taken out. Also, the film felt different to most other Pixar films, possibly because of the lack of Comedy. The main character (Arlo) also felt slightly clich\u00e9d.

This movie does not have the innovation that the other films do and it is really just a kids movie. Its still solid but this feels a bit more like a DreamWorks movie. The relationship between the dinosaur and the boy is really cute but the story feels recycled. I've seen it before and in better movies.

Arlo (Raymond Ochoa), the titular Apatosaurus, is animated in such a fashion as to suggest a tossed-off pencil sketch that's been filled in with fluorescent green paint. He's an anonymous blob with round, white, bobbly cartoon eyes, rendered with pointedly little of the painstaking detail that often abounds within even the most fleetingly glimpsed of Pixar's creations. The other dinosaurs are similarly basic in design, sometimes amusingly so, as is the case with a T-rex (Sam Elliott) with a huge, rudimentarily square head that juts out from its neck like the front of a tractor trailer, its body trailing behind with a dainty reserve that memorably contrasts with the character's fulsome western manliness.",
