Having said all that I just loved Amber Heard ( she is one beautiful girl ) and enjoyed Johnny's performance. They had some nice chemistry between them that wasn't used to good advantage. I think that the movie would have been better if they had more Amber and Johnny scenes. In fact, I would have re-written the final scene with Johnny sailing off and then cut to him knocking on Amber's door in NYC and them looking soulfully and lustily at one another. Then, I would have mentioned that he'd married Amber in the typed aftermath. Perhaps, in the end, I am just a hopeless romantic at times?

His writing can repel and enchant with equal measure and has a breakneck spontaneity which is rivaled by its frazzled incoherency. Incoherency would be the best word to describe this film. The story lacks any kind of focus jumping from a love story, a corrupt land deal, drunken antics, workplace politics and racial tensions. Watching \"The Rum Diary\" was liking talking to a drunk grad student; little flashes of genius may linger but after what seems like four hours you realize you're talking to a drunken idiot and looking for the door.
