In fact, I would have re-written the final scene with Johnny sailing off and then cut to him knocking on Amber's door in NYC and them looking soulfully and lustily at one another. Then, I would have mentioned that he'd married Amber in the typed aftermath. Perhaps, in the end, I am just a hopeless romantic at times?

      "text": "The Rum Dairy was an excellent film. No, it may not have been as crazy a drugadled experience that was Hunter S. Thompson's \"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\" but it was not meant to be. That's why I feel its received such low score by critics. Yes, it is a similar feel with Depp at lead followed by his adventures \"partners\". Paul Kemp (Johnny Depp) travels to Puerto Rico for a free lance journalism job at The San Juan Star where he becomes co-worker/ associates with 2 other strange and eccentric drunkards Giovanni Ribisi as Moberg & Michael Rispoli as Bob Sala. The three end up rooming together as the adventure unfolds and become somewhat of a team to bring back the failing San Juan Star as it begins to fail. During his time in Puerto Rico Pual Kemp becomes entranced by his new business partner Aaron Eckhart as Sanderson, a businessman trying to cook up a new money making opportunity and he believes Paul Kemp to be the right man to do some colorful writing for him, but things come to a grinding halt when Paul becomes entranced by Eckhart's mitress Amber Heard as Chenaul. I enjoyed it, kept me interested and gave me more then a few chuckles and as a fan of Hunter S. Thompson and Johnny Depp I felt it more exemplified their true values.",

Then there are issues you want to see evolve that are tossed aside or resolved off screen.  I was just left with a \"Meh...\" feeling when I walked out of the theater.",

Cant make up its mind if its a comedy or something else. If a biopic, I think it misses the mark by some way. A few good scenes, but never really takes off & aside from the back drop of Puerto Rico to add a sense of glamour, it sadly left this viewer somewhat underwhelmed.",

The book is nothing short of a masterpiece. Right after I finished the book I watched the movie to compare while the book was fresh in my mind. It's as if whoever made this wanted to ruin the book. They took out a WHOLE character in the movie, Yeamon. Chenault isn't with Sanderson in the book, she is with Yeamon. Who the hell changes the book that much. Not too mention all the other parts they left out and the bullsh*t parts they added such as the eyedrop drug and the chicken fights. This is an absurd travesty of The Rum Diary and Hunter S. Thompson is probably turning in his grave because of it.",
