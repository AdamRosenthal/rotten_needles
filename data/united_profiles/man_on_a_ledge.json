I thought it would be really dumb, but I work at my local movie theater and the majority of the people who saw this movie said it was pretty good. So i became intrigued. I finally decided to just go see it. Going into it with low expectations I was a bit surprised. It was good, but obviously not Oscar material or anywheres near that. With a pretty solid cast all around, including Sam Worthington (Avatar, Terminator Salvation) Anthony Mackie (The Adjustment Bereau, The Hurt Locker) Ed Harris (Alot of movies) and Kyra Sedgwick (The Closer). The cast made the movie look better than it actually was. Although Sam Worthington seems as though he just does any movie he can, hes still a pretty good actor, at least in the 2 movies i listed. The plot obviously is all around weak and very predictable. Everybody with a brain knows what is going to happen in the end. They were some very unrealistic factors in this film such as Sam Worthingtons character making a 25 story leap of faith jump, and just so happens to hit this 15 foot wide cushion thing right in the center, no whiplash or anything, he hops right back up and chases after Ed Harris. I mean, we don't always go to the movies expecting 100% realism, but come on, thats just a bit ridiculous. So overall, I enjoyed myself during this movie, but only because I went in with low expectations. There are very many holes in this movie that just can't be filled, even with a solid cast. If you go in expecting a perfect film you will be very disappointed, so i suggest you go into the theater open minded and you will be entertained. This movie gets an ok from me. 4.5/10",

Action movies are by nature unrealistic, but most of the time, at least some of the story is believable and makes sense. Man On A Ledge is a film that is all over the place, filled with scenes of unbelievable stupidity. The combination of corruption, theft, ridiculous moves, and lines that sound like their out of a comic book make this movie close to unwatchable. The man on the ledge has an agenda and asks for a beautiful negotiator to talk him down. Even she can see that he's stalling for time, but to what end? It leads to a totally unbelievable story with a horrible ending. I watched this film because I thought it would be different and I love both Elizabeth Banks and Jamie Bell. The cast was talented and the previews were good, but this movie is not. Man On A Ledge is just one of those movies that makes you question how stupid  like this even gets made in the first place.",

Two characters with the most prominent roles are probably the most irritating characters in recent memory. The plot is highly improbable and the action is dull. Sam Worthington can't be blamed for how bad the movie is, but he does not do much to salvage it. His back story? Same story as the one in Terminator: Salvation. I've seen this movie before, with all its cliches and dull twists. I promise you, it is not worth it.",

About five minutes in is how long my attention was kept. The majority of the plot is milked so thin that, I bet if all ideas had been thrown on the table and executed fast enough to keep us on our toes, the movie would only have been about 40 minutes long. It's like drinking a soda that is heavily watered down - it tastes mild, with only a few traces of the original drink caught on the taste buds. There is a lot of acting talent wasted here too. Sam Worthington, Ed Harris, Elizabeth Banks, Jamie Bell, and Kyra Sedgwick are all unable to save the movie from sub-mediocrity. In short (I shouldn't have devoted this much time to writing a review on something I despise so much) 'Man on a Ledge' is basically what you would expect from a January release. It might even be a little worse.",

How a desperate man steps out on a ledge of Manhattan Hotel to commit suicide. Why, what and who are told by flashback storytelling. Four! There are four key characters. First, Sam Worthington is the man on a ledge himself. Yes, we still hear his Australian accent, but it does not matter. He delivers a good and believable presence. We have been sweating along every time he moves around on the thin edge of the building. Elizabeth Banks is the police negotiator who interferes in thiz circumstance. Jamie TINTIN Bell is the brother who conducts a heist on next building, with his girlfriend Angie (Genesis Rodriguez). And Ed Harris is a powerful multi-billionaire who has a covert secret purpose. It reminds me of those simple movies that keep you entertain until the last minute, e.g. PHONE BOOTH (2002), CELLULAR (2004), RED EYE (2005), you named it! I always love thiz kind of movie. Three! Yeah, there are three possibilities to end thiz situation. One, finally he does not jump and the end. Two, he jump and the end, or there will be unthinkable surprise for the ending, one way or another. And yes, you know in your heart it wont end so easily, there are lots of twists and turns waiting for you. You bet! The mystery will keep you guessing until the end. The movie is presented by first-time Director Asger Leth. Two! There are two reasons to watch thiz movie. First is Sam Worthington. Two years ago, I told everyone that someday thiz man will be a great iconic Star. And hey look now. It is the future! He sells the movie only by his name! People will easily cherish him, Woo hoo, the man from AVATAR (2009). The second, if you have watched the trailer, I am sure it would tickle your curiosity about what will happen next. One! Jump! Jump to thiz movie immediately, thiz one is the movie that you want to see.",

      "text": "It's apparent not too long into 'Man on a Ledge' that the premise of it is more than it seems, as Nick Cassidy (Sam Worthington) takes to a ledge on one of the highest floors of a New York hotel, but it's immediately clear  that he doesn't have much intention of jumping, that a sleight of hand is in place. Without giving too much away, it's pretty clear that Nick Cassidy isn't up there for the view, or to leap off to his death, but what follows is aiming too much above its weight to the exhausting point of this steak being overdone.  We are lead down a path of conspiracies and ulterior motives, this is when it's easy to realise that the movie acts a lot more seriously than it should, a preposterous twinning of two stories leaves the film fun and cheerful, but not as dramatic as it is trying to be.  What irritates me is the fact that we start off with Nick climbing to the ledge, where we then see a month before where he is in prison, what could have been set up here is a simple dramatic piece of a man seeing error in his decisions, but instead a thriller with many shady characters and money falling from the sky to create diversions, this turns into a heist, to mask a thievery that didn't, emm, actually happen. Elizabeth Banks plays the negotiator who attempts to talk Nick down, she has her own regretful past as she sees that Nick isn't who he says he is. As a thriller, this certainly isn't a a dull affair, with plenty of pulsating action and several twists and turns throughout, but it's also entirely ridiculous and over the top, trading what was a good thing. The lead characters each bring something to the table, but in the grand scheme of things, they get lost in all the flashy ideas that we are given and they must settle for playing second fiddle to an over-arching story. Worthington plays a calm and collective individual on the ledge, but he is much more interesting on the ground when we learn about his past, but the chemistry between himself and Banks feel real and worthwhile. Supporting cast members Anthony Mackie and Titus Welliver deliver solid albeit limited performances, they have significant roles yet small appearances throughout the film. This sums up just how big and serious the film attempts to be, but everything is too co-ordinated to the point where the heroes never seen to be in danger, it's a fun thrill, but one which is playful and entertaining, not one which is too convincing in its execution.",
