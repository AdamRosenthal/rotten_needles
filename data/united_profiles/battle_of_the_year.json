I love Josh Holloway from Lost, but who in the hell did they sign him up in the movie?  This is a Step Up rip-off. If anybody that could teach incredible moves like this, it would have to be Michael Jackson. Bottom Line: Save it for the Razzies because this film is a dud.",

Also there are some a bit weird dialogues and it feels like the dancing (b-boy stuff) is the most important thing in the world at some points and they exaggerate about everything a bit. The ending was a bit unexpected maybe, but still it wasn't that interesting to watch. Only reason why I gave 4 out of 10 was because it felt like there might be something interesting going on at the beginning and it wasn't like I switched it off completely, plus if you want to see Chris Brown act or really liked LOST (one of the actors plays in the movie), then you might actually see it",
