This movie was neither mindless action nor space opera. It had ideas, which were worked out in a coherent way.

The film is smart, the plot is both simple and complicated in different levels. The performances are good. The photographic visions are mind blowing. And the scripts idea and conclusion, is challenging in both intellectual and moral aspects. So while the film may not be the sci-fi masterpiece of the year, it's definitely not as disappointing as many critics have claimed. It mostly looks like there's a negative atmosphere around this movie between film critics that looks ugly, whatever it is. Suggestion for sci-fi fans or anyone who enjoys smart ideas and intelligent movies: Ignore the damned critics, don't miss this film.",

This topic would be best served via television mini-series, maybe 6-eps.

When Caster is in the program he controls way way way way way way to much that goes behind our universe that's what Kate Mara was trying to stop. Director Wally Pfister (cinematographer of Christopher Nolan  since Momento, Insomnia, Dark Knight, Inception), his first directorial debut is this \"thing.\" Pfister has the potential of showing majestic cinematography and significant effects. But the way he visualizes characters is pathetic  and uninteresting like Morgan Freeman or Cillian Murphy.  Screenwriter  Jack Paglen has described something that does not make sense story, but the story is entertaining it's magnificent. Rebeca Hall's character is so idiotic that's why this movie is stupid. Grade B-",
