I think one or two things might have been done differently-but that is only a small thing I suppose. I do wonder if it is possible to make a self aware computer system but I think chances are you would only get a copy of a persons mind-but you never really know since the brain is basically just a computer anyway-but it is driven by pain avoidance whereas computers don't feel pain-its funny-if you made a computer work more like a person it would only be a computer that makes more mistakes and therefor be less effective as a computer. Nice work on this film-nice to see Johnny Depp doing something interesting-thought he was lost to the world. Best to see it with someone as opposed to going alone.",

This movie was neither mindless action nor space opera. It had ideas, which were worked out in a coherent way. My friends and I debated these ideas within the context of the film long after the film was over. But even though it had ideas, this was not a boring film. I fall asleep easily at the movies, even when I have had a good night\u2019s sleep, and this movie held my attention on all levels \u2013 ideas and story \u2013 throughout.  Maybe this film will turn out to be an \u201cAlien\u201d \u2013 a movie a lot of critics hated when it debuted (including Leonard Maltin and Roger Ebert), but came to consider a classic many years later.

It'll probably do poorly in the box office, following suit with other clever sci-fi movies like The Matrix, because critics and movie goers fail to comprehend and therefore appreciate it first time around. There are some very  profound messages in this movie, which includes many biblical references, the end being analogous to the creation story, when humanity rejects God's love and is cast out of the garden of Eden, which is where Rebecca Hall and Jonny Depp's characters end up in the end (the sanctuary), which could raise questions to whether or not this cycle has occurred already or not, when technology reaches the point where total harmony is produced, but is then rejected by us due to our fear of the unknown.

The main problems here are, to me, the dumb dialogue (which is filled with probably misused technical terms to make it sound smart) and the focusing, in the plot, on uninteresting folds of the matter, such as the conflict between Depp and Rebecca Hall, and the righteousness of the terrorist organisation. I think it would have been a more interesting film if it had focused more on the skills of the machine, maybe expanding its healing power to the outer world, rather than have it closed in an underground laboratory.",

      "text": "Johnny Depp plays a intelligent scientist who is  trying to  make technology better, he and his wife Evelyn advance AI (basically they are trying to make technology better, then they all of a sudden make a break through), when Will Caster is at the university talking to the people in the auditorium, he basically describes what he is trying to do with internet/technology also he describes \" Transcendence\" then something happens to a lab (which morgan freeman was in the lab). Then caster gets shoot! by someone who is part of Kate Mara's group then his consciousness gets put in a hard drive in one program, then extinction and the world at stake! including extinction;  Rebeca hall ( Caster's wife)  after she programs Will , Kate Mara's group tries to go after Evelyn cause they hate Caster's ideas, and when Evelyn takes off with Will into a small town that has a science lab.  When Caster is in the program he controls way way way way way way to much that goes behind our universe that's what Kate Mara was trying to stop. Director Wally Pfister (cinematographer of Christopher Nolan  since Momento, Insomnia, Dark Knight, Inception), his first directorial debut is this \"thing.\" Pfister has the potential of showing majestic cinematography and significant effects. But the way he visualizes characters is pathetic  and uninteresting like Morgan Freeman or Cillian Murphy.  Screenwriter  Jack Paglen has described something that does not make sense story, but the story is entertaining it's magnificent. Rebeca Hall's character is so idiotic that's why this movie is stupid. Grade B-",

It's worth a rental, a cheap rental but a rental none the same. It will not make it into a true Sci Fi Geeks VHS/DVD/Blu Ray collection. Just not worth the shelf space.",
