      "text": "Seated at a cafe table for one, a beautiful, young woman, unaccountably lonely, peruses and pines over a comic book, and its handsome male hero. The music video for A-ha's \"Take on Me\" is the ultimate geek fantasy: the blond seems to have a fondness for an illustrated world over the real one, just like any introverted fanboy. The protagonist, as it turns out, a Norwegian protagonist, without explanation, blinks at the Londoner single, as the comic panel loses its static purpose, when the graphic hero reciprocates the customer's **** of the crush object with a crush of his own, and extends an open invitation to the startled reader, who nevertheless, grabs the hand protruding from the ephemeral page, and enters the diegesis of pencil sketches, suddenly made fluid by the alchemic properties of synth-pop music. In 1985, every sad, maladjusted boy wanted to be A-ha frontman Morten Harket, because that's how a wallflower could be heroic, by saving a damsel in distress from rival motorcyclists armed with pipe wrenches from the safety of a debauchery-free bedroom, alone with his Martha Quinn sex fantasies. Wallflowers get older. Some survive their awkward teenage years, and bloom, like Charlie undoubtedly will, in The Perks of Being a Wallflower, while others, such as Jorge, a morbidly shy dishwasher, will not, ever, in Steve Barron's Choking Man, a micro-indie that shows how ostracized children grow up to be ostracized children. Barron, the filmmaker who helmed \"Take on Me\", references his music video past, in a scene where Jorge's enemy, the restaurant manager, who delights in torturing the monosyllabic dishwasher about his aloofness, breaks into a mocking rendition of Kajagoogoo's \"Too Shy\", another early MTV classic. Again, animation is employed, but this time, the optimism, in regard to love, found in \"Take on Me\" has given way to resignation, and finally, vehemence. No wallflower, struggling through his adolescence, would want to co-opt Jorge's constipated ideas about love. His cartoon bunny rabbits won't even rub noses. Jorge doesn't dare, perhaps, since he knows the cute Chinese waitress could never love him back. For sure, the schizophrenia doesn't help, but the real reason that prevents him from competing with Steve for Aimee's heart is his ramshackle appearance, whereas Charlie, despite being saddled with PSTD, earns Sam's love because the unformed freshman more than offsets his emotional problems with an appealing visage. Charlie is less a nerd than unathletic. At the outset, he suffers the indignity of eating alone in the school cafeteria, but you're never worried for him. That's why the budding writer comes off as whiny and disingenuous when he expresses a concern about not making friends to his teacher. He's good-looking.. Soon enough, Sam, and her half-brother Patrick, take Charlie under their wing, and introduces him to people, self-described as castaways on \"the island of misfit toys\", wallflowers all. He finds his tribe. The film, and the Steven Chbosky novel it's based on, thankfully, avoids the shortcut of outfitting the nerd with glasses, like, for instance, Dawn Wiener, the president of the Special People Club, in Welcome to the Dollhouse. Whereas the misfits find each other and stick together at Charlie's school, in the Todd Solondz film, the estranged outcasts at Dawn's junior high estrange themselves from each other, choosing to go it alone rather than garner strength in numbers. Here, the weak pick on the weaker, like when Troy, pinned against his locker by the resident 7th grade bullies, lashes out at Dawn for defending him. \"Leave me alone, Wiener Dog,\" he grumbles, humiliated, doubly, since the girl who saves him is perceived as ugly. But even the consensus school pariah, the plucked to death wallflower, has a cruel streak, evoking Groucho Marx's famous quote: \"I don't care to belong to any club that will have me as a member,\" when Ralphie, a charter, and only member of Dawn's social organization, hears himself being called an \"a**hole\" and a host of other obscenities, as Missy tries to get her older sister to take his phone call. Unlike Charlie, there is no midnight screenings of The Rocky Horror Picture Show\" with friends, or being told by a girl that your first kiss should come from somebody who really loves you. Dawn has to settle for a sad night in her clubhouse with a boy, who in the way of introduction, tells her that he's going to rape her, as they stare at the night sky while Debbie Gibson's \"Lost in Your Eyes\" plays on a cheap tape recorder. Sam kisses Charlie because he has a naif-like animal magnetism. His predecessor, Lucas(from the 1986 film starring Corey Haim), does not, and as a result, Maggie, a cheerleader, rebuffs the younger boy's clumsy attempt at romance, by turning her lips away from his. When you're a wallflower that often gets confused for a weed, there are no perks.",

The film was adapted and directed by, none other than, Stephen Chbosky, the author of the cult novel of the same name. He successfully captured teenage angst, the bohemian culture of the unpopular and more personally, the trials of a terribly introverted youth; in ways that only he could accomplish. Such a fresh script was written for this memorable indie film, there was no way the three principal cast could stumble. Logan Lerman, Emma Watson and Ezra Miller all give moving performances, and fill the screen with characters you can\u2019t help but root for, whether or not you agree with their lifestyle or choices. As brief as this review may be; I really enjoyed this film, down to its awesome soundtrack and its hazy conclusion. Brisk and to the point, I highly recommend this tale, set in the early 1990\u2019s, to all.",

Written and directed by Stephen Chbosky, The Perks of Being a Wallflower is an exceptional coming-of-age film, even one of the best I have watched this year. Why do I consider it one of the best? Film's storyline, its characters and their brilliant performances, the narration and those funny, emotional and uplifting moments spread throughout the film. Talking about the characters, the main characters include Charlie Kelmeckis (played by Logan Lerman) who is a shy, socially awkward and unpopular high school student who lost his best friend recently but he is also sensitive and a serious thinker which makes him different from others. Logan Lerman has played the role really well, regardless of your age, you can feel connected to him and feel his emotions, making it the best peformance of Logan so far. His friends Patrick (played by Ezra Miller) and Sam (played by Emma Watson) are the ones who change his life in a certain way. Both of them give wonderful performances, Watson never disappoints me, whatever role is given to her, she does it extremely well. Ezra Miller's performance is also quite strong, I liked it a lot. He is funny, he makes everyone laugh but deep down, he is depressed and not a lot of people know about it.  All of the characters in the film are likeable, whether they are positive or negative, the film's environment is wonderful, I felt really great while watching it. I haven't read the novel so I don't know how much both the movie and the novel vary from each other but I'm completely satisfied as a movie lover, it did the magic for me, it moved me emotionally, it is powerful and soft at the same time. I have decided that the Perks of Being a Wallflower is one of the best films of the year.",

      "text": "Per un adulto e visto da fuori, \u2018Noi siamo infinito\u2019  un lavoro da prendere con le molle. I film sui liceali sono sempre a rischio di scatenare l'orticaria, basta vedere quelli che ammannisce Italia 1, e il fatto che alla regia ci sia Chbosky che, praticamente all'esordio, segue la sua sceneggiatura tratta da un suo libro, pu\u00f2 solo acuire i sospetti. Beh, non  necessario attendere la conclusione dei cento minuti di durata per rendersi conto che, questa volta, i pre-giudizi sono del tutto infondati: la storia dell'introverso Charlie e della sua amicizia con i fratellastri Sam(antha) e Patrick conquista da subito grazie al disegno preciso e delicato dei personaggi e a un ritmo che non viene mai meno pur raccontando un'evoluzione psicologica che si sviluppa attraverso i piccoli fatti di ogni giorno. Tra lezioni, feste da ballo e azzardate reinterpretazioni del \u2018Rocky horror picture show\u2019, Chbosky segue con affetto i suoi personaggi che, per un modo o per l'altro, sono figure ai margini del loro piccolo liceo di provincia: per questo, appena arrivato, Charlie si trova subito in sintonia con Sam, che ha fama di ragazza facile con la tendenza a mettersi con l'uomo sbagliato, e Patrick, omosessuale innamorato di uno dei giocatori della squadra di football, che sono invece all'ultimo anno (uno dei pochi difetti del film  che la differenza d'et\u00e0 non si nota e, infatti, Lerman e Miller sono quasi coetanei) e insieme cercano di darsi una mano a superare i rispettivi problemi. Oltre alla naturale ritrosia e a una passione per i libri alimentata dal professor Anderson (immancabile \u2018Il giovane Holden\u2019), il protagonista si porta a spasso anche un trauma infantile: il rapporto con la zia Helen  un po' pretestuoso in verit\u00e0, tanto che la sua assenza avrebbe reso pi\u00f9 omogeneo il racconto, ma viene utilizzato come catalizzatore della crisi che, dopo lo spavento, aiuta tutti quanti a crescere, adulti (forse) compresi. Con tali premesse,  quasi superfluo sottolineare come tutto il film sia permeato di una diffusa tristezza, che  del resto una caratteristica costante nelle migliori opere legate all'adolescenza: risulta perci\u00f2 assai azzeccato che la prima svolta nel racconto sia legata ad \u2018Asleep\u2019 degli Smiths, le cui splendide perle pop sono immancabilmente immerse nella malinconia che evoca gli \u2018anni importanti\u2019 della crescita. Del resto, tutta la colonna sonora  molto ben curata, inanellando una serie di brani per la maggior parte di provenienza \u2018indie\u2019 come quelli che i ragazzi si scambiano con insistenza su cassetta (l'ambientazione  all'inizio degli anni Novanta): ci sono la contagiosa \u2018Come on Eileen\u2019, gli Xtc  in principio sorge un sospetto di anglofilia poi dissipato  i Pavement, i Cracker e altri che elencare sarebbe troppo lungo, ma tra i quali trova posto persino Joey Ramone alle prese con la spectoriana \u2018Christmas (Baby please come home)\u2019. Si riesce cos\u00ec anche ad accettare che, in quel periodo, dei diciottenni appassionati di musica non conoscessero \u2018Heroes\u2019 di David Bowie, canzone che, da parte sua, conferma ancora una volta la fascinosa cinematograficit\u00e0 nelle belle scene del tunnel. Queste ultime sono le uniche costruite allo scopo di aggiungere pathos al momento, mentre il resto del film si mantiene allineato alla semplicit\u00e0 delle situazioni in modo ammirevole, caratteristica che, assieme a una fotografia che predilige i toni caldi, amplifica l'empatia dello spettatore: il resto lo fanno gli interpreti, con i maschietti che forse si fanno preferire trascinati dal faccino pulito del bravo Lerman e al pi\u00f9 problematico Patrick di Miller, ma anche con una Emma Watson capace di regalare a Sam le giuste sfumature a testimonianza che forse c\u2019\u00e8 vita oltre Hermione Granger.",

This movie is great for all ages especially students.  This movie displays touchy subjects such as severe depression, bullying and suicide.  These subjects in the movie don't encourage these behaviors like other movies, they simply show people that these do happen but being a good person and being kind to people helps.  This movie is great, it was brilliantly done, I highly encourage everyone to go see it.",

This movie brilliantly directed by the author of the original novel but it doesn't stop short of giving you the moments that you loved from the book and allowing you to live them yourself,  whilst still keeping the persona's of the characters true. Their stories never felt cheesy. Just real, touching and moving. The Perks of Being a Wallflower is best if you can actually relate to the lead character or have experienced the struggles of being an adolescent. When it's not depressing, the film goes to those blissful moments that make us remember the good times in high school. Overall, The Perks is an amazing film. It's a film adaptation that replaces the cliches with some painful realities of adolescence and high school and simply lets you understand the whole point of it. In the end, it's quite a remarkable film.",
