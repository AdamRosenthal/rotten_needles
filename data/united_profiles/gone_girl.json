      "text": "Gillian Flynn's book 'Gone Girl' is one of the best novels that I have read in years. It has great characters, intrigue and a bold ending that would definitely not be to everyone's taste. It's a real intelligent page turner that once started can't be put down. The problem with 'Gone Girl' the film is that it has been so faithfully adapted, too faithfully even, by Flynn herself that there are no surprises to be had. I acknowledge that this sounds churlish when there are so many book adaptations that are bad, but the lack of surprise unfortunately dulls the movie experience. The film is well cast. The setting feels right and the score sets an appropriate tone. However, David Fincher's unfussy direction does nothing to add an extra visual dimension to the story. As a result I felt somewhat disappointed by my own reaction, even whilst rationalising the reason for it. As already stated the actors are almost perfect fits for their roles. Ben Affleck is better than I had expected and really carries the film. Rosamund Pike, although over praised, is still good and the supporting cast are pretty much spot on, with a special mention to Neil Patrick Harris. The sequences that involve him are amongst the best in the film.",

The story itself was well thought out, well written and well paced making the 2hr 20mins run time entertaining and enjoyable for the most part. The reason i haven't given this film a 10 is because of the ending. Again without revealing anything i can't give specifics but there are a few things that don't add up and the reaction that the policewoman gives to the out come seems to be there just so the director could get the ending he wanted.

At really no point does it lag and while it is certainly very slow at times, it never becomes boring and leaves you hanging on the edge of your seat for much of it. Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike are stellar here, as are Neil Patrick Harris and (oddly) Tyler Perry. The cast, on paper, seemed odd, but in practice, David Fincher shows why he is one of the best around and got the best out of everybody. The general feel and mood of the film is also brilliant and entirely chilling. However, beyond the whole murder mystery type deal, the most interesting part to me here was the total indictment of the media and the 24 hour news cycle, which Fincher does a great job showcasing throughout and how the media will believe just about anything and then jump to conclusions based off of what small information they may have. The twists and turns here are also very interesting and the script from Gillian Flynn is very strong. The way the story was told at times was odd, but that would be my only complaint really and it was nothing major. As a whole, this is certanly not Fincher's best work (Seven, Fight Club, and Zodiac, would be my top three from him), but it is certainly not his worst (excluding Alien 3) and is overall, a very well made, well acted thriller that will leave you wanting more. Would be surprised if Affleck and Pike are not major contenders at the Oscars.",

First of all, the characters and their relationships are very well developed, establishing the moral of each one, representing their own stereotypes and then breaking them; second, the narration style is preserved, immersing the viewer in the game/conflict between Nick and Amy, creating a serious reflexion about how marriage changes people or how people change for their marriage; and third, the twists in the storyline that mess with your mind. David Fincher definitely was a great choice for directing this crime novel, and we see him in all its glory, such as Se7en or Fight Club. The problem is that Gone Girl is more than that, is a combination with a psychological thriller (characteristic more distinguishable in the book), and is here where Fincher fails; the torment and questioning that invades not only the protagonists, but also Go and Amy's parents, its not so clear in the film. Another huge problem is Ben Affleck, he makes Nick a static character, its impossible to empathize with him, though same parts of the movie requires it, others not. Nevertheless, Rosamund Pike is magnificent as Amy, which compensates everything.",

The characters perpetually evolve and morph before our eyes and perceptions (which, ultimately, becomes the prevailing theme the film succeeds to get at with a particular eye towards the \"shock value\" ideology of a 21st century electronic media). The premises of overwrought suspenseful machinery coupled with perspective flashbacks and, above all, a sardonic sense of humility within very clever and with great wit and verve human dialogue. Notwithstanding a few plot holes near the end- the film stands out in its gorgeous (Hitchcock gothic) cinematography, adroit acting, and compendious execution of deep subject matter (namely, marital and communal knowledge; the epistemology of identity of the self and the other; irrationality and truth).",

Gone Girl is a treasure hunt that may have gone too long, and gotten too ahead of itself - but the overwhelming sense of dread and atmosphere is enough to tip me over to the other side.

As I said this movie looks beautiful. The cinematography and lighting are both excellently done. The writing contains a surprising yet fitting amount of humor. The narrative unravels in an intelligent and unique manner. The acting in this film is top notch. Everyone in this movie was truly outstanding. Rosamund Pike is the standout performance here though. She absolutely becomes the character of Amy Dunne. She is on point with every single thing she does in the movie. Affleck's performance as Nick Dunne has to be touched upon as well. His character is very mysterious and unclear in his motives. His awkward personality causes people to become suspicious of him throughout the movie. This awkwardness is something that Affleck does excellently. This movie touches on themes of marriage, social norms, economic hardships, and the behavior of the media; all these themes are brilliantly intertwined throughout the movie's narrative. Gone Girl is strangely hilarious, intriguing, and disturbing. It is a perfect movie.",

This hitchcock like mystery defies the viewers expectations again and again and executes every plot twist masterfully. the film also has an excellent cast; ben affleck does an excellent job portraying a border line idiotic average joe who becomes the prime suspect in his introverted wife's disappearance, this is a potentially career changing role for Rosamund Pike who plays Afflecks wife whose disappearance quickly spirals into the scrutinizing eyes of sensationalist media and even becomes a murder investigation , this film even made Tyler Perry look good! TYLER PERRY! the only issue i had with the film was that the final act felt a little sluggish and drawn out, otherwise this an intriguing and memorable mystery that you should definitely see",

The film also manages to be a very entertaining thriller that has you gripped from the first scene as our protagonist Nick, portrayed by Ben Affleck, tries to figure out what has happened to his wife Amy, played by Rosamund Pike who absolutely steals the show. Gone Girl is smart, slick and enthralling psychological thriller that i recommend everybody to watch.

Without giving away any spoilers, I think we've come across the best cinematic villain since Hannibal Lecter, and the best shower scene since Psycho. Whoever below said it was like the most Hitchcockian example of modern filmmaking: I think that observation is spot-on. Fantastic. Even after knowing the plot I was totally riveted.",

It's a faithful and expertly paced rendition, in-keeping with that book's uniquely nonlinear style, unreliable narration and clever use of red herrings, even if it is perhaps too cerebral for its own good and somewhat overpraised and underwhelming given the hyperbole. Nonetheless, Rosamund Pike and Ben Affleck are perfectly cast - this is a breakout role for Pike and a career-best performance by Affleck. Neil Patrick Harris, on the other hand, was miscast and his character doesn't have the necessary development in the film as he does in the book. Likewise, Tyler Perry is underused. But this still another worthy entry to David Fincher's repertoire which includes similarly good adaptations of \"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" and \"Fight Club\". It's certainly a must-see for fans of the book.",

Best-selling author Gillian Flynn's debut as a screenwriter is just chilling and effected craft. We have Ben Affleck playing a desperate dick husband, he tries to make the media and everyone us believe that he did not kill his wife (or had anything else to do with the disappearance).  Rosamund Pike is even slightly better than Affleck's character. Kim Dickens character was really amusing as the detective. Carrie Coon's character \"Margo\"  was had a good comedic presence to the screen, but at times the stuff she says sometimes can be at the wrong time so that's what  i guess. I am not sure if this film is gonna impact Perry's career, but it'll get the guy a better role. Neil Patrick Harris' character  is awkward and lovely at times. But the ending is stupid! Grade A-",

In 2014, that film is Gone Girl, Gillian Flynn's adaptation of her own best-selling novel brought to the screen under the capable guidance of A-list director David Fincher. Fincher, who's no stranger to dark material (Seven and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo being examples), understands how to get the most out of Gone Girl and the result is 145 minutes of riveting drama and surprises. And, although the movie doesn't represent a page-by-page recreation of the book, it captures key aspects including multiple (sometimes unreliable) narrative perspectives, commentary on what \"guilt\" and \"popularity\" mean in today's media-saturated culture, and (of course) a Hitchcock-tilted storyline seeded with twists and turns.",

The story slowly sinks you in and while it is so long, you still want it to go on even when it ends. Affleck gives his best performance to date, (pre Batman, I'm writing this review after seeing batman). and Rosemund Pike is so crazy its terrifyingly awesome. An Absolute allstar cast, leads this suspenseful mystery that leaves you on the edge of your seat.",

At least then I could have forgotten about it and moved on just a hangover.  Ben Affleck's portrayal is (I assume) supposed to be an idiot or the movie wouldn't have gotten as far as it did.  I'm glad i watched it at home but it was at my wife's suggestion.  Just completely implausible at the end.  What a waste of 2 1/2 hours of my life.",

He's also one of those who likes to keep twisting your perspective of each character around and around until you don't even know how to feel. The ending really was tormenting in both the good and bad way. While it tied the story up nicely, it left a bad taste in my mouth. Rosamund Pike does well with the psycho crazy and Ben Affleck is pretty good at playing Ben Affleck.",
