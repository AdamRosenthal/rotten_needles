At the end, when Gringo gets out of that building, the effects are so unrealistic! The event in Chile is real but the Eli Roth and Nicolas Lopez spin off of this disaster is unrealistic! It's like Lopez and Roth were eating cake and Lopez is like- what if we made mega garbage to destroy thingamajigs and include a hell a lot of f**king gore. It didn't look like I was watching Aftershock. I looked like I was watching Finding Nemo. No story, no point and no real environments- that is why aftershock sucks. Selina Gomez sucks at acting. Really, Lopez took beggars to act in his film. Except Roth who is ruined and worst actor of the year for me. Yet. We'll see what s**t comes for us in the coming years.",
