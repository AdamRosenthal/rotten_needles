When Bobby (Washington) and Stig (Wahlberg) rob a bank filled with forty million dollars they find themselves hunted by multiple parties keen on getting their hands on the exuberant payday. Making matters worse is the fact Bobby and Stig aren't exactly being honest with each other about who they are. A fast paced, unrelenting joy ride through a simple but entertaining story that uses played out action tropes to tell its tale but manages to keep the proceedings thrilling despite some of the generic pratfalls. Washington and Wahlberg share some great chemistry as they sink their teeth into witty dialogue that Washington proves he is more than willing to take advantage of. The film doesn't take advantage of all its assets as Paula Patton is underutilized as Bobby's ex partner despite an interesting introduction filled with some completely unnecessary nudity to boot. Sure the films key demographic is young males but the film seems to be begging somewhat with the addition of dick jokes aplenty and the prerequisite pair of jubblies. That being said, 2 Guns is damn good fun, a breezy crime caper that while not entirely harmless is light on real consequences. Finally its a film worth watching for the shocking fact that Bill Paxton, an actor written off by most (including myself) gives a stellar performance as Bobby's adversary and CIA spook, a cruel sleazy and all around disgusting wretch of a human being  so wonderfully repulsive he bring the film to life whenever he appears and Paxton nails it. Ultimately its a smooth ride worth a watch not only for a taste of Washington as a comedy actor but also for Bill Paxton (Never thought I'd say that.)",

The only reason I decided to watch this film is because I am a huge Denzel Washington fan, however my expectations for it were extremely low. It's rare, but occasionally, a preview can harm the reputation of a film, and that's what happened here. The previews make this film out to be nothing for than a big gun fight with the occasional cheesy line, but it's so much more than that. In a unique twist, two undercover agents, from two separate agencies, wind up going after the same man. Looking for a way into his organization, they find each other and assume the other works for the bad guy. Both Washington and Mark Wahlberg create characters and put on a good show for the other, having no idea that they're actually working towards the same goal. What really makes this film work is the chemistry between Wahlberg and Washington. Denzel is plays his usual level headed, super intense character, while Wahlberg's playing a laid back, reckless guy, who actually does have some pretty funny lines, that they weren't about to show in the previews. Together they go through on an amazing adventure, full of good guys and bad guy crossing and double-crossing each other. There are at least a half dozen factions tied to this evil man, in different ways for different reasons, and each representative is more unique than the other, leading to some amazing interactions. 2 Guns is the story of 2 agents caught in the middle of a huge conspiracy, that seemingly involves every one. While that may be confusing to some, I found it refreshing, because the truth is you never knew what would happen next. When one side struck, it could have been anyone, for any reason. The unique story and large supporting cast, paired with the terrific chemistry between the two stars, made for an absolute classic that fell under most peoples radars. If you're looking for a good movie, that will have you on the edge of your seat, then you should check out 2 Guns! I can't recommend it enough.",

In addition, to their chemistry, I did not mind the script. The plot was terrible, but I thought the script was largely pretty well-written and really served as a good foundation for Wahlberg and Denzel. However, in saying that, the plot was indeed terrible. Outlandish and completely unrealistic, it sucked all the fun out of the movie watching this preposterous plot unfold. Baltasar Kormakur is better than this, as are Wahlberg and Washington.

Each of these organizations betrayed their single agents because they stood to reveal their bad nature. In turn, the \"2 guns\" went rogue and committed acts that would be deemed 'terrorist.' Of course, the audience is supposed to root for them, so everything they do is ok. This was just one of the political topics hit out of many I saw, including the debate on welfare (The ridiculously long and unneeded scene where they argue over tipping), and the morality of betrayal in relationships (Denzel and the Latino chick.) I saw others, but they don't come to mind. Maybe I'm just flipping out over a whole lot of nothing, but I still don't see the point in having a plot that tries to carry so many different things in it.

Icelandic director Baltasar Kormakur, who worked with Wahlberg on 2012's Contraband, knows how to move action along. He's so good at it that you believe the tired old B-movie plot might actually spring to life and relevance. No such luck. What can I say about the story? That Washington's Bobby Trench and Wahlberg's Stig Stigman rob banks together. I could say that, but it wouldn't be true exactly. And if I say any more I'll be pilloried for being a spoiler sport. So I'll say this: the supporting cast, especially Bill Paxton and Edward James Olmos as baddies, comes up aces. So does Oliver Wood's sleek cinematography. But you can't tell me a B-movie can't be exciting and smart. Why? Because Washington and Ethan Hawke proved it could be Antoine Fuqua's Training Day. Washington has a nice, noirish line to his romantic interest, a cop played sexily by Paula Patton: \"I really meant to love you.\" Hell, I really meant to at least like 2 Guns. But I couldn't.

Playing bank robbers with a hidden agenda \u2014 a classic cake-and-eat-it scenario that allows the audience to root for the bad guys \u2014 Wahlberg and Washington prove yet again why they\u2019re among the most beloved male stars today, as they bro-out and bang-bang their way into our hearts and each other\u2019s.",

There's violence, but nothing gratuitous until the finale, there's swearing without it taking over the script. It's all a bit like a Lethal Weapon re-boot.",
