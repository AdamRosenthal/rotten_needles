The acting was dreadful, the story was cheesy (i know its Nicholas Sparks so i expected it) but this movie was just terrible.

By the way Taylor Schilling has to be the worst actress i've ever scene on the big screen. She couldn't even fake cry, and when she started laughing while crying, she sounded like a retarded baby. This movie was just awful. Not enjoyable what so ever. The best acting in the film came from the little boy for christs sake. For once in a blue moon the critics actually got one right.

Rarely does a director improve on a book (Horse Whisperer and Robert Redford is an example) and so I think that the director failed when he didn't stick with the book.  Nicholas Sparks has great ideas, and sometimes not so great endings, but the beginning and middle of the book were better than this movie.  I am not a tween nor a 20 or 30 something, but have had to take course work for art in pursuit of a BA and MA.  I love sometimes stupid movies just for the laughs, but this movie was a total disappointment.  I gave it two stars for the effort of the performers.  The director shoulders the rest of my disgust with his freedom of interpretation.",
