It's easily the worst horror film i've ever seen, and I'm a fan of horror movies, having seen all the cheesy ones like 2001 Maniacs and Return of the Living Dead up through all the classic ones like Halloween and Friday the 13th. The dialogue in this film, particularly towards the end, just starts to crumble with lines like 'fly away Condor' or eagle or whatever it was that the pathetic imagery was supposed to evoke. The film really unravels after The Stepfather-esque opening and just gets worse from there. There are no 3D effects to speak of in this movie, so if you wasted your $13 or so on the 3D version, please accept my humble condolence. I remember a few years back there was this horror movie called One Missed Call, which was a remake of an earlier film, where there was this housekeeper named Rosa. That movie, too, was a real stinkfest, but at least at one point in the film when Rosa gets the knife, an audience member said loudly 'Poor Rosa' and we all laughed because we knew we'd been suckered into a slick marketing campaign for a terrible film. In My Soul to Take, there's no such luck. There are no laughable audience-inspired dialogue moments. The whole movie is just a complete tank. Go see something else instead and wait with baited breath for the critical trashing of this movie to commence. It's well-deserved. I give this movie a 0 simply to honor the $13.50 I lost at the box office on it. At least the popcorn was good, though!",

I walked from the theater smiling, while slightly jaded by the totally unnecessary use of \"3-D\" in the film (jackass 3d used it more effectively, ha), i was impressed and deeply entertained by the self-referential and retro feel of this silly sleazy slick horror film. It's a given that every cliche in slasher-film history is at dispense, but Craven has damn fun with this. I immediately felt like I was watching an 80s slasher with a modern production aesthetic and a smirky, nearly slapstick attitude. The unknown cast confidently portrayed a delicious slew of campy horror cliche characters in a manner that felt fresh and well timed. I laughed more in the theater (as did the thin audience) than feeling any true sense of dread or nervousness, but that seemed to not be the focus of this 'scary' movie. If you appreciate 'B' horror films (mainly from the 80s slasher variety) Craven's direction will tease and delight you with its silliness, but tantalize you with its freshly cut violent scenes. Seriously though! I was shocked to see how negatively this film has been discussed. Come on people, open up to the true fun of camp. And not camp by way of poor piss acting, uneven pacing, asinine storytelling, and just bad production values... this is creamy classy camp love project from Wes Craven... it's silly cast is quite quotable to boot! It seems like most reviewers/critics of this film have missed the point, and disregarded the slick, fun production Craven crafted for this popcorn experience. 3D was added after filming and was totally unnecessary though, but the movie was worth my $12.50, maybe another.",

It may actually be the malevolent spirit that inhabited his body coming back in the form of someone else to kill. Okay, a little muddled but okay. We set up the premise that the group of potential victims are seven kids born on the night of his death sixteen years ago. Okay, getting a bit more convoluted than I like and not completely understandable but I'm on board. All of these are acceptable because I know that Wes Craven is enough of a skilled hand at this genre that he will make them clear and work within the confines of the picture. Right? Guess again.",

From there on, the movie turns into a gorefest lounging by a pool of blood, as people are gutted, slashed, and smashed in brutally graphic scenes. And yet, the movie still maintains some horror, though it could do a lot better if it just chose a genre already (Slasher flick? Horror movie? Make up your damn mind!). And the ending, god the ending just sucks. Instead of ending it in a dreary, dark tone (Which would've made the movie much better.) Craven decided he wanted it to be a happy, great ending scene. It'll have you shaking your head and walking out feeling disappointed. Also, there are a ton of loose ends that never get tied up. For one, what was up with this demonic crap anyways? At times in the movie people start talking all creepy and deep, like any other horror flick possessed person, yet that is never mentioned.

Perfect film to get you thinking also as it's a mysterious Thriller where you need to guess who the killer might be, similar to 'Scream' films. A great group of young actors and characters, as well as having some jumpy moments. The best thing was it held your interest the whole way through, and if you have the DVD check out the alternate endings!",

Wes Craven made this?  I don't get how you can be the man who supposedly tore clich\u00e9s apart with Scream,  I haven't seen it yet), and still make crap like this.  Every single moment which is supposed to be scary is hilarious, and you can tell it wasn't purposefully done that way either.  The two leads could have been good in a well written movie, but no one can emerge from this unscathed.  I can go on forever about how bad this film is, but that would be a waste of time.
