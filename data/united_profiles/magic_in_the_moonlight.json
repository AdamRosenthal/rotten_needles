Dunno about Woody Allen's personal morality (and I had some misgivings about seeing the film because of that), but it was an entertaining and compelling rumination on life.  In short, if you like movies that make you think about big existential questions (and you're bright enough to infer the deeper meaning), I think you'll enjoy the film.

As for me, I found this to be without a doubt the worst Woody Allen film I've ever seen. It's maddeningly slow-paced, trivial, predictable, derivative and dumbass to its core. There's no humor; no interesting ideas are explored; there's nothing emotionally touching; and there isn't even any clever plotting. I didn't laugh once, and normally I love Woody Allen's humor.

This film transcends the nay sayers and the hoorayers and can be judged on its own merits for by so doing, the viewer will experience a beautifully written and well directed work of theatrical art. Mr. Firth is fine in the role of the arch magician out to prove or disprove the abilities of Ms. Stone\u2019s character as alleged seer and psychic. The movie sails along at an easy pace as it relates the story in a well edited and interesting manner. Add to this a soundtrack of great songs of the early 20th Century and you end up with a positive audio and visual theatrical experience. Kudos to Mr. Allen who has once more brought his \"magic\" into the theater. I give the film a well deserved 8.5. Bottom line: this is a good film to see and one that I think most people will enjoy..",
