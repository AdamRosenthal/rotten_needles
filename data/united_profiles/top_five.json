I was expecting a raunchy comedy, unashamed of it thirst for laughter and comically respectful in its view of the black community; although free from strict restrictions to realism.  With that genre in mind I found Top Five to be a great movie.  The comedy is top notch (I'm even smiling as I think of some of the scenes now) and it's success at blending so many cameos by top comedians was a true treat for the audience.  I don't give it an excellent rating because (1) Chris Rock can't act (2) My excellent rating is reserved for \"smart\" not \"raunchy\" comedy and (3) the decision not to play out the ending may be creative to some but I found that to be lazy.  But other than those things I thought this movie was great and I'm looking forward to seeing it again.  But, for some, the sex scenes can be disgusting and the language could be offensive.  I found them to be funny but I can understand and appreciate someone who disagrees.  This isn't a movie I'd be comfortable viewing with my mother and I'm 45 years old :-)",

Let's be brutally frank and open up the discussion.  If a white man wrote this movie and stereotyped the way Rock did, he would be blasted.  Deadbeat dad; money hungry, star seeking, empty headed ho for a fiance; jewish friends who literally talk and throw money at strippers;  (Seinfeld shows true arrogant, self absorbed, narcissistic self); ghetto acting friends stuffed into the projects filled with fat wives, kids running around and more deadbeat dads drinking in the middle of the afternoon expounding on their talents are a few of the stereotypes but there are too many to mention all.  Apparently  it is OK if Rock is doing it,  its not stereotyping, its keeping it real.  To add insult to injury, the audience is supposed to believe that Rock, in the course of a day, bears his soul to an interviewer (who yes is an alcoholic too) and in a faux Cinderella moment runs back to her at the end of a day with a Satin shoe to seal the deal.  The crap the audience has to sit through to get to this fairy tale ending is outrageous, but not funny. There is  an orgy with two hookers, Cedric and Rock himself, complete with visuals and sound effects,   It is not pretty and pointless.  Rock, like his comedian friends is completely self absorbed and is affronted that his movie release about Hatian rebels is not taken seriously.  I guess this is a parody on  the idea that black entertainers need to be making a political statement to appease their own.  Anyway, it is a sham of a movie that seemed carelessly thrown together.  It is sad that in this day and age, we still need this kind of \"in your face\" insult of a movie to get a point across.  It is true that the black voice is missing.  However, if Shondra Rimes can do it, so can a person of Chris Rock's stature and talent.  I felt cheated at the end of this movie.  Chris, it was a cheap trick. I expected a lot more.",

Rock gives an often times funny and honest performance as a comedy star trying to make it big as a dramatic actor all while under heavy press due to an upcoming wedding. Rosario Dawson also gives one of her best and most honest performances to date as the reporter assigned to interview him. Overall, while I did wish I could 've gotten a few more laughs out of the film, it was still undeniably entertaining and it also felt like one of those rare comedies nowadays that has a little heart to it compared to most comedies that are made purely to be silly and gross.",

The film really captures what is like to be famous and adds a little humor to it. Both Rock and co-star Rosario Dawson were great and there are a lot of other really funny character that we will recognize throughout the movie like Tracy Morgan and Kevin Hart. We also get some really funny cameo appearances that I will no spoil. Top Five is not the funniest movie I ever watched nut its composition is original and it is just a down right good film even there was no humour. I would really enjoy another film with Chris Rock at the helm again.",

You can fell when watching the film that Chris really cared about the Subjects/Themes covered and wanted to get his message threw to people. Top Five follows Chris Rock playing a character extremely similar to himself who's stuck dealing with people wanting to see him play the same rolls in movies over and over(Sound familiar?), but Chris wants to move forward onto bigger things in his career.The film also touches on dysfunctional Hollywood couples and Critics/Reporters that will say truly horrible things to get a story. Those darker themes aside this film was hilarious, Chris Rock and the rest of the casts chemistry was pronominal and at points it doesn't even feel like they are acting for a camera but just hanging out like old times. The humor isn't for everyone, if your not well versed in Classic Hip-Hop jokes may slip pasted you.",

But do a friend a favor, and bring a buddy. I'm going to now, because I have to see it again. I haven't laughed as hard or been this surprised by a film in a very long time.
