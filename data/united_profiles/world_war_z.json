Secondly, the first half of the film was extremely good especially as things in the world were going to hell. But it seemed to fall apart a little when Pitt started just flying all over the world. Finally, I think the movie suffers from a lack of identity because it wasn't really a thriller or horror and it seemed to try to do a little of both to no real success.

What brings that down is that the story is basically focused on the zombies, they don't utilize a great actor, the story is frankly dumb sometimes, and there aren't any characters to delve into. I like Brad Pitt, but for being the lead and the most focused character, there simply isn't much to him or anyone else in the movie. With that in mind there are definitely some enjoyable scenes that are shot very well. I left the theater just not caring about anyone that I saw, there is no human connection to the film other than Gerry (Brad Pitt) and his family. The action is good, the scares are present, and overall the movie is focused on the zombies and finding a cure. At times it's a pretty generic story set up, but there is a light at the end of the tunnel and some scenes shine.",

      "text": "When Romero made Night of the Living Dead in 1968, he introduced a horror that was akin to the haunted house of a theme park.  Zombies were a slow, marauding, creeping dread.  When his movies were remade in the 90's and 00's, the dread of the haunted house was replaced by the adrenaline rush of a roller coaster ride.  Suddenly zombies were fast.  Critical scholars might point to the exponentially quickening feeling of society and its developments and problems leading to the shift.  On television people are bombarded by endless waves of information and propaganda, tickers scroll by in all corners saying this or that.  We've become conditioned to need things to be moving fast, lots of moving and shiny parts, to be appealing on a large scale.  I can't think of a movie in recent years that has done this part better than World War Z.  Its special effects are almost flawless, we see zombies behaving as a hive species, using their bodies to create more efficient means of transportation, much like ants do.  The technical achievement is stunning, as are the visions of a world thrown into explosive chaos.  My eyes darted around the screen constantly, trying to process as much that was going on as possible.  The sheer pace of the movie never allowed my adrenaline to completely drop.  This was a roller coaster ride.  I'm actually surprised it didn't garner an 'R' rating  it's a very aggressive, shocking movie in parts  and although it spares the gallons of blood seen in its counterparts, scenes of people being smashed under cars, having an arm cut off, yanking teeth out  I guess I just find it humorous and telling that a movie with a few boobs would get an R, while this stayed at PG13.  Anyway, that's an aside.  It's a good movie, a total popcorn flick.  Pitt is okay (I never really think Pitt is anything better than okay, for an example of why I think he'll never be a 'good' actor just see his reaction to his daughter at the beginning when she asks him what 'martial law' means).  But he's eye candy and he does carry the movie with a certain soulful charm.  Direction, great  set pieces  phenomenal, action  almost unprecedented.  Which brings me to story.  Despite liking this movie quite a bit, it bears no real resemblance to Max Brook's infinitely superior book of the same title.  An indie movie like 'The Bay' did a better job of segmenting contributing storylines into a coherent whole, and I would have loved to have seen a more literal interpretation of Brooks' book.  I think they could have done wonders with it and truly made the zombie movie of zombie movies.  Instead, they went a different route, opting against the slow dreadful creeping global menace, captured by individual stories of survival  and, well, they went for the rollercoaster.  They manage to have Pitt globetrotting, so they do capture the 'flavor' of different regions of the world, but in the movie it's really all one flavor, while the book had very different 'feeling' settings, accentuated by interesting cultural-specific nuances and behaviors.  That's what made the concept work for me, and they didn't pull it over into the filmed version.  Had they called this movie something else, I would have been more impressed, because the remaining links to the book are mere strands.  Plus, I'll personally always be more frightened of the menacing dread of a lumbering zombie, to the adrenaline rush of a fast one.  So this movie is a mixed bag.  It's a good action flick, it'll keep you glued to your seat, and you'll feel you got your money's worth.  It's a decent addition to the zombie genre  turning zombies into swarm predators isn't new but it's never been done on this scale or with this much style.  But as an interpretation of Brooks' book, it's pretty sad.  I can't imagine the author is happy with where this went.  The masses will love it, fans of the original will wonder what happened to their book.  The absolutely blatant foreshadowing of sequels means Brooks' already-classic zombie yarn will likely continue to be raped for years to come.  I will be in the front row,  and moaning the whole time while I get my guilty jollies.",

Marc Forster's film is a zombie based action film led by Brad Pitt with occasional references to locations (Israel) or terminology (Zeke) from the source material. The term 'based on' has never been so loosely used. Being a massive fan of the book, I lowered my expectations for the film to match my disappointment after finding out that the screenplay was not staying truer to the spirit of the book.

Their were a lot of cool scenes from the movie, like where the zombies were climbing on the barricade, all this scenes were cool and big, but their was this intense where Brad Pitt and his companions were trying to sneak past zombies without tracking any attention, for me they could've showed us more of that scene throughout the whole movie. Sometimes the movie lacks an identity, sometimes it's action-packed and sometimes it's horror, but it's just a little gripe that didn't affect the movie experience. Some people didn't like the ending, because for them it was a bit rushed, for some reasons I agree on that statement but for me it was a decent ending  World War Z is decent zombie movie and I am going to give it a 7/10.",

And had our complete attention with the crazy action scenes. My favorite part is hard to choose. It made me sad, afraid, and happy all in about 2 hrs. The zombies looked great, the graphics were great. The story line made sense. And It had a satisfying ending. The Scene in Israel with the gate was awesome,  So was the plane scene, and ending scene in the Research facility was awesome. BRad Pitt played a loving husband and father,  striving to keep them safe.  Along with saving  lives  of many others. and i liked that he was just a regular guy, who observed the zombies behavior to come up with a solution  GREAT MOVIE  A MUST SEE",

I mean sure there are zombies and the world as we know it ends, but when the whole movie theatre laughs when a zombie gets a close up, it kills the essence of the theme. The movie attempts to be character driven but the acting and plot are just plain weak. On top of that, the story literally gets no where. Every new scene seems to be completely disconnected from the previous. I honestly cant think of a moment in the movie that awed me in any way. The positives to this movie are so minuscule. There really are no similar movies to compare this to, but if you have seen the show, The Walking Dead, the quality of screen play and emotions provoked from a zombie apocalypse do not even come close. 3 seems like it may be a rough score but as a fan boy, this movie was a true let down.",

      "text": "I wanted to see how powerful Marc Forster's World War Z was, what I got was 2 hours of good, bone crunching, zombie horror fun. Sometimes a movie surprises you. Something you thought was going to be a mid-summer slog or an underwhelming riff on familiar themes turns out to be something more. Familiar tropes are reinvented, a tired villain gets new life, and presumed lines of safety are crossed. You find yourself in the middle of a relentless rush of anxiety, fear, and exhilaration, and when you walk out of the theater you can\u2019t wait to tell someone what you just witnessed. World War Z is that kind of movie. The adaptation of Max Brooks\u2019 best-seller has been best known up until this point for its production problems. Last year Paramount delayed the film\u2019s original 2012 release date to allow for extensive reshoots. Much of the blame was laid at the feet of director Marc Forster (Quantum of Solace, Monster's Ball) and a script that hadn\u2019t been ready to shoot. Writers like Damon Lindelof and Cloverfield\u2019s Drew Goddard were brought in to completely rework the film\u2019s third act in an effort to salvage the big-budget tentpole from disaster. The finished film starts off by mercilessly throwing the audience into the deep end of the zombie apocalypse. There\u2019s a brief scene where Brad Pitt\u2019s Gerry Lane makes breakfast for his wife Karin (Mireille Enos from The Killing) and their two daughters. Then the family find themselves stuck in city traffic and all hell breaks loose. Explosions strike, fast-moving zombies swarm, and everybody starts running for their lives. A former investigator for the United Nations, Gerry is able to get his family to safety on an aircraft carrier with the help of his colleague Thierry (Fana Mokoena). Whatever struck the world struck fast, Gerry learns  the president of the United States is already dead  and with the entire globe infected the only hope is to find Patient Zero. \"Mother Nature is a serial killer,\" a UN doctor tells Gerry, but she does leave clues behind. To ensure his family stays safely aboard the ship, Gerry agrees to lead the investigation into the origins of the plague. It\u2019s such a quick progression of events it makes your head spin. In fact, it\u2019s almost too fast; at a certain point, it feels like somebody left out the requisite moment when everybody looks around and wonders just what these crazy zombie creatures actually are. But by then the movie is already off to its next action set piece. And what set pieces they are. World War Z is a string of unrelenting, harrowing sequences that continually manage to top one another  spanning multiple countries, the ground, and air. When attacking en masse the zombies are an overwhelming tidal wave; one-on-one they\u2019re a vicious mix of tics and snarls. Imagine the undead from 28 Days Later, make them twice as fast, and combine them with the swarming fury of fire ants and you\u2019ll get an idea of World War Z\u2019s creatures. They make the zombies from The Walking Dead look positively cuddly in comparison: lightning-fast biters straight from the subconscious that simply do not stop. The movie shouldn\u2019t be confused for a Romero-style zombie flick, however. World War Z is a disaster film in the classic 1970s sense  think The Towering Inferno or The Poseidon Adventure  serving as light allegory for our indifference towards nature while also bringing a lot of smarts to the table. Early on, Gerry gets zombie blood in his mouth and runs to the edge of a building, realizing he may have to throw himself off should he transform. He clocks the 12 seconds it takes for people to turn upon witnessing his first transformation, putting the pieces of the puzzle together quicker than what we\u2019re used to seeing. Pitt carries the entire movie, as both its star and emotional core. Gerry\u2019s mission is simple and basic  he wants to keep his family safe  and when he says goodbye to his daughters you believe it. Forster thankfully takes the time to focus on these small character moments, which could otherwise get lost in the face of the film\u2019s larger sequences. Gerry\u2019s wife Enos isn\u2019t given much to do other than furrow her brow and stare at a satellite phone, but together the pair provide just enough of an emotional hook for the story to work. The film\u2019s ending also feels like it\u2019s missing one final note. It certainly works, but given the emphasis on family and Gerry\u2019s emotional drive it\u2019s hard to escape the feeling that it could have gone just a touch further. It\u2019s as if Forster and his creative team were able to get the ball to the 1-yard line, but couldn\u2019t quite punch it into the endzone. Of course, with so many summer movies fumbling at the 40 it\u2019s a mild complaint. There\u2019s tremendous joy in watching a movie like World War Z that just works. Too many films this year have seemed more concerned with showing the audience how clever they are  either though misdirection, callbacks, or faux gravitas  instead of just telling good stories.",

And what fallowed is probably the most fun I had watching a movie this entire year, with the Jerusalem sequence deserving special mention. If you are looking for a deep plot, complex characters or even the kindergarden-level social commentary of the Romero movies you will not find that here. But if you are looking to spend one afternoon watching a movie with action, tension and (mostly involuntary) humor, World War Z is perfect.

Employee, Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt), is out with his family when a recently discovered virus hits the United States and all hell breaks loose. The first 45 minutes of this film were literally like the pilot of The Walking Dead. No one knows what's going on, people are panicking, it was all very predictable. The film does go into a different direction after that, but how many different ways of doing a zombie film are there? Lane starts traveling the world seeking a cure for the disease, while at the same time trying to avoid being attacked. The unfortunate fact is that no matter how good the acting or the writing, there is very little you can actually do with a zombie film. The zombies and the circumstances behind the outbreak are always a little different, but ultimately it becomes about survival or the race to find a cure. Brad Pitt is terrific, and as I have been saying for year, it doesn't matter how good looking the guy is, he belongs in action films! This is the genre where he excels and even though World War Z was painfully predictable, Pitt makes it worth watching. He is the focus of the story and it takes a lot of quick thinking and tremendous stunts to keep him alive. For me that was the best part of the film. There was a lot of hype behind World War Z and it was a very intense film, but like I said, there is very little you can do with an end of the world/zombie film that hasn't been done over and over again.

All of the other characters whinge dramatically at the camera in hushed tones about the horrors they've witnessed in a manner that has become par for the course in zombie fiction, but the problems with this film lie not with the actors, the effects, or the direction. The good things about the film are bogged down by the fact that the plot is absolutely abysmal. Almost every single action that drives the \"story\" forward is predicated entirely on human stupidity.

That is absurd.

Unlike most zombie genre films the plot isn't about getting somewhere, gathering resources or simply trying to ride out the apocalypse, instead it focuses on some important guy rather than some average Joe and seems more about finding the cause and cure of the outbreak. The film focuses on Gerry '(Brad Pitt) and his kind of forced mission to get to the bottom of the mess the world is now in. Pitt is good for the most part but seems to ironically struggle in the scenes with his on screen family. the plot is fairly repetitive: go here talk run repeat and this got on my nerves after the first time even with the fairly short run time. The special effects look good compared to in the trailer and convey the idea of a horde of zombies on screen. If there was a gaping flaw in this film it was the lack of scope in the film. The plot was almost totally revolving around Gerry with little else; survivors or zombie outbreaks even being mentioned in passing would have been nice.",

I have mix feelings about the new movie because the film is been delayed after they have huge problems to make a big zombie film for redoing the script, take time with the story, and making a realistic event just like the novel. The new story takes place in the United States where UN investigator, Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt) and his family are having a good time in a road, unfortunately the crisis of mad zombies taking over the world and of course the entire nation was corrupted by fast zombie diseases. Lane and his family escape from the apocalyptic world, until the crew wants Lane to find someone who has a cure to make the zombies go down or save the entire people in each country. The zombies are fast and blood eating monsters and they capture the people in the fast CG effect including one scene where zombies are climbing the top of the hill like a large ant hill. The scenes are pretty scary to look at and zombies scare away from the screen. The characters are alright, but not closely to the book, but they stay focus on the protagonist to fight over zombies. World War Z is an okay film, but the film is pretty lacking like how the zombies climb on the wall, how does the zombie affect the entire world, or does the book explains about real events of tragedy or survivors. The film is rated PG-13, but it goes down of making this movie pretty decent and we can't sure if the movie is safe for teens and we might quite to make this movie for an adults like putting into the R rated.

Things happen because the script demands they happen, the dialogue is goofy and sometimes hard to understand, characterization is non-existent, and the way the zombies work in this movie is frankly stupid. No tactics are used by the military to combat the zombies (something that was prevalent in the novelization) and people act functionally retarded in survival situations. The logic behind the infection is parasitic in nature, despite the nature of the infection being viral. No hive intelligence can be born out of a viral infection, no matter how hard the writers to try to convince us or how hard they crap all over the source material. Apparently, all it takes is a serious infection via a deadly but treatable disease to become \"invisible\" to the zombies... because they don't want to infect hosts who are seriously sick. Yes really. First off, they say a virus wouldn't kill a zombie. Okay... so why would a zombie care if the victim is infected with H1N1? Why would it care? Flesh is flesh. There supposed to be ZOMBIES, NOT rabid humans. 28 days later already did something similar to that guys.",

The trendy \"constantly moving camera\" that is so in favor with directors these days must end!

      "text": "Based on the book by Max Brooks, World War Z tells the story of a zombie outbreak and a fathers quest to keep his family safe. The film ultimately thrives thanks to director Marc Forster's grasp of tension and wonder and how to bring them both out simultaneously in his shots. The film follows Gerry Lane (Brad Pitt), a stay at home father who was a UN investigator before his kids were born. When an outbreak occurs, Gerry is sent to discover the source of the outbreak, patient zero, which sends him all over the world as he tries to find a way to save humanity and by extension, his family. World War Z really does feel like 2 films due to its highly publicized re-shoots. There are famous actors (Matthew Fox) reduced to bit parts thanks to story retooling, differences in dialogue from the trailers, World War Z just shifts about halfway through the film from political thriller to all out thriller. The overpowering politics of the first half effectively vanish in the new material in favour of a tense final set piece that is incredibly well made. That doesn't mean the first half is bad, in fact World War Z is smart, cleverly constructed and well filmed. The script however is cliche ridden in the first act of the film with the outbreak being unique but often times sullied by cheesy dialogue or unclear action set pieces (a particular scene on a apartment block staircase is really hard to watch). Pitt makes Gerry a likeable lead but at times it comes across as slightly unbelievable, his ability to escape situations even the strongest people couldn't. The film lacks the feel of an apocalyptic event at times as the film is restricted by its 12A rating but it doesn't take much away from the experience. To be honest, this is a zombie apocalypse I will happily watch again.",

The feeling of hopelessness is on par with the 70's remake \"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\", as their is literally almost no place safe on the once life filled planet we all love. The movie is scary to bet, but the most surprising aspect of the story is how emotional it is. The characters almost always react at how they would in certain situations. The expressions and emotions are felt as the characters themselves understand the horrifying situation they are in. It's what the world would be like in the middle of an apocalyptic crisis such as this. My only problem with any failed reaction is the little boy the family picks up early in the film. This kid narrowly escapes the bloody massacre of his family and is even chased by his undead parents and yet you hardly see any fear or state of shock from this poor kid whose life had just been completely destroyed within a day. While I am at it I should point out the ridiculousness this film has offered a few number of times. The so called \"spectacular\" zombified wall climb isn't impressing to me at all. This is where CGI get's overdone in many movies. The way they make the zombie break in scene is absolutely ridiculous. Their is no way sound would make the zombies attract themselves to the walled structure so much, that they would be able to pile on top of each other and scale a 200 ft wall! There could have been many more logical problems that could have arisen for the zombies to overtake the city. Things like these are what makes the movie slip whenever the tension that drives the story forward, come off as overdone and cheaply slapped on. The clumsiness of the zombies massing over each other like marbles are sometimes dumb as well.  Still I praise the originality this movie has to offer. Brad Pit does an excellent job acting as the father of a desperate family trying to survive the terror. Now I have heard many people critic over the amount of violence in this movie. Well if you want to see an over the top blood and gorefest (their's enough horror movies made every year), than you came to the wrong place. You don't need to see everything and frankly it's what you don't see that will scare you the most in this film. Wherever you go you can almost feel the infected are going to pop up anywhere at anytime. Granted the INTENSE and violent nature of this film will leave you on the edge of your seat. The zombies are absolutely ruthless, doing whatever it takes to kill you. Just at how they hurl themselves at the characters and the speed at which they do will make you jump. Without a doubt, the last scene in the movie the most pulse pounding. Truly one of the most tense driven times I ever experienced in the cinema. It's really at the end where it all comes down to for originality. I love how ending is played out and it's uncertainty is faced. Give this flick a look.",

Because the all feel the same if you have seen one zombie movie you've seen them all. You know what? World War Z is no different. It's your standard zombie movie that we already have too much of. This movie is based off of the 2006 book of the same name. I haven't read the book because, well, I can't care. Not that it matters seeing as this movie has nothing to do with the book it is based on. But whatever. I would talk about the story, but again standard zombie flick. What I will say is plot holes a plenty. The biggest problem I have is how pointless all of the characters really are. They are nothing but a bunch of read shirts whose only purpose is to appear give out exposition and die. Even characters who seem important will die quickly and be forgotten even quicker. The only character who survive the zombies beside Pitt and his family is an Israeli soldier whose name you won't remember so you will just call her Israeli soldier. The only thing quicker than the red shirts' deaths is the poor pacing of the movie. the character will spend only seconds in a scene before it ends. There are important scenes where you think something will happen or be explained, but instead it is over within seconds. I find this really lazy as it takes up the films entire running time almost two hours, leaving an unsatisfied feeling from the watcher. Also there is a lot of things that just happen to happen, like when Pitt gets to Israel and the zombies get through the wall. Why? Because the peoples chanting, because as we know Israel is known for how quiet it is. The actors bring nothing to the table. Alonso Duralde of The Wrap put it best when he said, \"For all its effectiveness at portraying the horror of possible human extinction, the film's actual humans are so soulless that this could just as well be the movie version of the video game Plants vs. Zombies.\" If you see the actions of the zombies you will find it just as funny. Finally the ending, I will say I am one of those who was surprised and impressed with how they defeated the zombies as it made total sense. However, Brad states, that despite this, that it isn't over yet. Which makes no sense as literally the next scene has some guys setting a mountain of zombies on fire. All Paramount is trying to do is give a reason to make a sequel. No. Really. They have confirmed that World War Z will be a trilogy. I look forward to nothing changing in the future. As for this movie, it has to be a 3/10. This was a lazy movie even by zombie standards and to think that a movie like this warrants a sequel just increases my annoyance with the capitalism in the movie. Disagree comment below.",

Second act is where to many holes open in the story, why did the \"best chance for humanity\" only have a couple of half baked military guys in their unlimited range cargo plane?  Gerry Lane should have fallen on his gun here, load up the troops from Camp Humphreys who seem to know what they were doing and move out.  While visually stunning the Israel portion makes no sense with streams of still living refugees and ignores the political implications of the wall they are already building.  The third act is tolerable but a let down, Gerry should have been long dead by now since the UN & WHO would have collapsed in the first minutes of this disaster. The last screen shot of the happy family reunion is pathetic.  So if a sequel is to be made remember that this is first and foremost a zombie war movie and forget the gee whiz Lost ending.  Take a lesson from Battle for Los Angeles or Aliens and let us see a good cathartic war/horror film with zombies vs. hard core military on an epic scale.",

Yes, it is plagued by the same exaggerations all zombie films suffer from. However, World War Z is actually a genuinely good movie, zombie nonsense aside. The acting, led by Brad Pitt, is fantastic and the plot develops well. The intensity in the movie starts up right away so there's no lag time to deal with while they develop the setting. The setting is already familiar... it's America today. The discovery of the zombie outbreak is part of the joy in watching the film and the initial sequence where you're first introduced to the situation is one of the most intense segments in recent memory. The action itself feels very realistic, aside from the aforementioned exaggerations that is. Pitt isn't made out to be some superhero or anything so he feel real too. The only real flaws for me were the exaggerations and that the ending felt like it was rushed. The entire two hours builds to this culmination that just ends right away and doesn't give you much closure. I suppose they were going for that with how they set the scene in the closing moments but from a viewer's perspective, I would've liked it a bit differently. Overall though, this is a great movie that most people will almost certainly enjoy.",

The climax, unfortunately, dragged the tempo to a halt. Where it was epic in scale before, the movie decided to draw inward and concern itself with a petty WHO facility. That wasn't a very important event in the face of the worldwide pandemic. It should have been resolved quickly and the scope once again returned to epic. That event, even if it was very difficult to resolve, was not worthy of the climax and should have not been afforded more than ten minutes. The climax should have been something more in tune with what had happened before it. The production values are of course brilliant and it shows. The zombies, in my opinion, have not been done better than this. Brad Pitt plays his usual suave self, unflustered by anything going on about. It could have been better.

He goes to one place it all goes wrong he escapes and that is basically the film so it gets repetitive. Despite this the mass amounts of zombies and chaos is fun to watch and means you sort of forget about the repetitive nature of the story. Towards the end the film goes for a more calm suspenseful take which kind of makes it feel disconnected from the rest of the film but it still works. The idea that to make our troops invisible to the zombies by giving them a disease is interesting but I question how effective it would be i mean you cant expect an army of sick soldiers to fight the zombies it will be interesting to see how the idea works in the sequel. the ending is a bit abrupt but it works.

There is plenty of suspense rather than simply relying on gore and zombies popping out of nowhere at easily predictable moments.

      "text": "This was one of the movies I was really excited for, I was looking forward to seeing a zombie movie of this scale be on screen for the first time. When I finally got a ticket and found my seat, I was a little disappointed. I couldn't think of anything this movie could do wrong, but it's amazing how amazingly unremarkable this is. World war Z fails to leave any lasting expressions; at least with the other action movies I saw (Man of steel and Pacific Rim) they had something that made me remember it, but here I can't remember anything spectacular other than the effect of the zombies. Speaking of which, the idea of zombies doing some of the acts they do in this film is pretty cool to look at, but that can be said about a lot of zombie movies. This does however have a good lead, Brad Pitt is pretty good in the position of a man with a family going into these hordes of zombies to find a solution. What he finds is actually the only thing that I remember that's interesting; conceptually, that by being infected already with a disease can prevent the zombies from seeing you. That said, it in my opinion ruins any ideas for a sequel; which is the most infuriating part in this film, because there's nothing to worry about. I haven't talked much about the novel of the same name because I did not read it, and I really should because my friends highly advise it. I best wrap this up, overall this is just a fun zombie thrill ride; I really wanted some more political talk and more substance, but is just so dependent on it's lead who doesn't carry the whole film when I don't care about anything else.",

Simply massive hordes of zombies, that cant really be fought. The film was predictable, but the story itself was different than other zombie stories. The way they get infected, they attack, spread, and fight is much different than any other story I've read or watched. The one great thing about this movie, is the fresh style it brings to zombie films. It strays away from the normal, small hordes, occasional big hordes type world. Because the story was predictable, i didn't care too much what happened in the end, which obviously will bring the Angel Beats score down. The story didn't leave you feeling empty, as Angel Beats did, so very well. Even though billions of people died, all across the globe, the ending didn't make me feel empty inside. Again, as Angel Beats did. It would have been so much better, if they made a larger impact on you. I felt they didn't push the epidemic, mass death side of the story too much. As they only focused on the cure, even though the scene in Jerusalem put the world into perspective, the Angel Beats rating, was still not very high. If you are thinking of watching this film, just know, it wont leave you as satisfied as Angel Beats. So overall, only 6 Angel Beats, out of 10. A sad score, for such a hyped film.",

With all the production problems this film had id have to say i was actually pretty surprised by how much it didnt suck. Sure i would have loved a different director i just dont think Marc Forster can do action movies i think we all remember how bad Quantum of Solace was. Another thing is the fact that its a PG-13 movie makes it a hard sell there was barely any gore in the movie and thats what zombie movies thrive on even the uncut version they released was weak. Watching the trailer though i thought the CGI was going to be crap esspecially the Israel part but i was wrong and it ended up looking pretty decent. The editing was a mess and it felt like we would go to one place kill some zombies then go to another place and do the same thing it was pointlesss. The ending was crap though i see that they opened it up for a sequel but id rather hope this film doesnt get one.",

It's amazing though, that outside of that one problem, everything in WWZ is good enough for it to get a 9 out of 10. WWZ is very different from other zombie flicks. It's not filled with gore, and it's not like The Walking Dead where they try to survive in a post-apocalypse world. It basically is, well, a world war with zombies. In terms of acting, WWZ's only shining star is Brad Pitt. Everybody else is basic. WWZ mixes up genres, too. It is a thriller, horror, and action movie. However, if you are a true die hard horror fan, you might be disappointed (wasn't a problem for me). WWZ's action is hard to describe. It is definitely intense and has good fear building, but it's not the kind of violence you'd expect. I loved the zombie action, but it's not exactly what Transformers fans would want. That's okay. It's beautifully shot, too. Some of the best parts come from when thousands to millions of zombies are piling up on each other to wreck havoc. I loved every single part of WWZ except....THE STORY AND ENDING. It starts off fairly good. As it progresses though, it just becomes so jumbled and convoluted. The plot can get dumb at times, too. It was a big problem as it went on. The conclusion leaves so much to be desired and it's one of those types that just screams \"SEQUEL!\". I hate those kind of endings. Besides the story and ending, WWZ is constantly entertaining.",

      "text": "World war z follows he story of a UN employee (brad Pitt) on his mission to halt a zombie pandemic. The film starts off great and gets abit dull in the middle but towards the end it picks up. It is tense from start to finish the only thing I would heavily criticise is the fact they barely go into detail as to how the outbreak started, they could of added a whole new layer to the story but instead they just used the main character as the focal point without adding anyone else into the fray. The film has got some bad press but generally I'd say its worth watching as it's not your usual zombie movie, it's actually believable and the zombies actually seem intelligent rather than walking around aimlessly. The acting as a whole is pretty bad imo, the only actors that really deserve credit are the kids, as brad Pitt barely says anything and all his wife does is look into the camera looking **** scared. I would of gave the movie a much higher rating if they would of just built on the plot, which I have heared the book does very well.",

World War Z doesn't really establish anything creative, its just the same old zombies that we've had in movies for the past 40 years, all the same characteristics and weaknesses. George A. Romero established all this before with all his films. Save yourself some time and watch Dawn of the Dead or Night of the Living Dead instead of World War Z.

I did like the realistic tone that was present throughout, making me believe that a zombie outbreak could really happen. Unlike I Am Legend, I thought the way World War Z solved this global catastrophe was believable and eye-opening. Of course the star of World War Z is Brad Pitt, and he does a great job in my opinion portraying the character. My real problem is with the actual character itself. It seems as if this guy is invincible and can overcome any obstacle that comes in his way. I didn't read the book so I'm not sure if that's how the character is written, but it did draw me out of the movie at times. The ending felt very rushed which did affect my grade of the movie; however this is a solid film with more style than substance.",
