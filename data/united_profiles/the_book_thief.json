Each actor nails it as their characters perfectly, and delivers the perfect amount of emotion and dialogue. It's some of the best acting I've ever seen in a film. the writing does a great job of sticking to the book. While there are obviously differences, and things outright taken out, the majority of the writing keeps true to the book. Even though I don't deduct points for accuracy, I was impressed with how well it did towards the original novel. Even without the book accuracy, the writing and script were excellent. When it comes down to it, my only problems with the film is the safe approach and inconsistency. The film does decent with its Nazi Germany setting, but plays with it way too safely. It seems like they tried not too mess with such a setting, and because of it, it feels like the Nazi setting is approached a bit too brightly, except for a select few scenes. But the biggest problem is the inconsistency. Death narrates the movie, just like he does the book, but the problem here is that he's used a few times, and at random. It makes me wonder what the point of bringing Death into the film was, because his random use feels seriously off. Aside from this problem, The Book Thief does excellent thanks to its strong acting and great direction, and I'd definitely recommend you see it.",

      "text": "An air of artifice hangs over 'The Book Thief' like a heavy fog and not even seasoned pro's like Emily Watson and Geoffrey Rush can save it from being a stultifying bore. This Second World War story is based on a best selling novel but its adaptation here is protracted and bloodless and must be classed a major disappointment. Young Sophie Nelisse, as the titular character, looks the part but her line delivery at times comes over as phonetic. The production itself looks immaculate, but again this is also a big problem. as everything is just so pristine. At one point Emily Watson berates the girl as being 'filthy' when in fact she looks as if she is on her way to a photo shoot. A bogus in-authenticity pervades and prevents the film from generating any true emotion or pathos. John Williams' pretty score adds to the detrimental effect and actually feels as if it belongs to another type of movie in another era. A couple of scenes do ignite. The cellar search grabs one's attention temporarily and the ending, coming as it does from left field, causes one to stir in a way that the rest of the film never does. I also have to mention that the scene where Geoffrey Rush plays his accordion whilst everyone is hiding in an air raid shelter, made me think that the cast were going to start singing Oom Pah Pah a la Carol Reed's musical Oliver!  One thing I did like was the unusual narrative device which is intrigueingly employed at the beginning and used to devastating effect at the end.",

Although the story can be a little too predictable and trite at times, it still delivers a strong impact and generates much sympathy for the characters.

The book thievery happens in a 15 minute span of the whole 2 hour movie. As a historian, it pains me to view their feeble attempt to cover WW2. The chronology of the war is all screwed up. They had Germans still deporting Jews in 1942, which all deportation had been dealt with. Lezeil and Rudy's fathers had been drafted into the war. Let us take the time to note these two gentlemen are in their late 60s or 70s. Now men like this were drafted into the war, but later in the war like 1944/45. The drafting for these men happens in 41. The movie tries to give the viewer a notion of time passing, BUT ALL THE CHARACTERS LOOK AND ACT THE SAME AS THEY DID IN THE BEGINNING OF THE FILM.

There's a constant sense of dread, but never much real drama. So many plot points are predictable and the whole things feels manipulative in a Hallmark Movie of the Week style. While it's competently made, it's slight on emotional impact. On a side note: It also observes one of those silly Hollywood traditions.

The first flaw is that it the entire movie was fairly slow, which may or may not actually be a bad thing. The main flaw is how they leave so many details out as well as some of the aesthetic details. More than a few years progress in the story and yet the only thing that changes in the main character is her hair style ans maybe a bit of makeup. Many story details are left unresolved such Max's story and the girl's mother.",

It has some pretty heavy political commentary throughout, but really, the story of Lisel, her foster parents, and her friends is an interesting and engaging one. Its moving from time to time, and equally enjoyable. If you like this sort of movie, WW2 movies not focuses on the fighting, then this one is a must-watch, If your looking for something to watch with your parents, or your kids, then the same applies. Just don't go in expecting the best movie in the world.",

If the story is good...which it was...and the acting is exceptional then naturally us as audience members will enjoy the ride.  I highly recommend everyone of all ages to watch this masterpiece.",

It makes you wonder about who we are.... how can people became so evil and so blind... what makes us do the things that will hurt others beyond repair. It is definitely movie to watch again. You will not find answer to those questions, but you will think and ask yourself the same things over and over again.. it is also a movie about unconditionally love and good in the evil times of the third Reich. At the time of fear their is a love, laughter, joke, people who don't judge others by religion, skin color.  There is an light of hope for humans. I will definitely read a book. :)",

They have told the story through the childs eyes hence the lack of blood and gore some critics crave. Sophie nelisse will be a major player in the film industry in the future, demonstrating a natural talent for the big screen, appearing to carry her role with seemingly effortless ease. It was not my type of film as i prefer a more gritty, hard hitting retelling of world war 2. It is aimed at children and for that i believe it was perfectly produced and entirely believable.",
