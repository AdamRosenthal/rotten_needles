Looking to escape the insanity of their every day lives, the boys decide one summer to build a cabin in the woods, where they can live off the land like men. Nick Robinson stars as Joe, and gives a performance that is out of this world. In a film that stars three kids in the woods, it would be very easy for things to turn stupid very quickly, but as the leader of the pack, Joe not only keeps the group together, but keeps the story together. No matter what this young man does over the course of his career, he will have a hard time duplicating what was easily a career defining performance. Robinson is paired with Disney star Moises Arias, who until now I thought was just this weird little guy they used to guest in their shows. Arias plays Biaggio, easily one of the funniest characters I've seen in a very long time, some of the things that come out of his mouth are just fall on the floor funny. As the kids enjoy their time in the woods, their parents really start to show their crazy, as they go on a hunt for the lost boys. The characters were all unique in their own way, but Joe's father, played by Nick Offerman, was far and away the best, leading the parents the same way, his son lead the boys. From gigantic wontons to turtles on kites, The Kings of Summer is an extremely enjoyable film and the rare instance of a film that I wish was longer. I truly loved every second of this smart coming of age comedy, for it's uniqueness and young exciting cast. Blending dramatic and comedic elements, The Kings of Summer is that perfect mix that takes you from laughter to tears and back again.

The writing is pretty good, not great, but it works well throughout and the direction here is pretty good and the story winds up being told well. The acting is really good. I loved Nick Offerman here, he really played the role of the father really well and brought a certain aura to the role that worked really well. In addition, the characters throughout were really well-developed and their stories made sense. They felt like real human beings everyone knows, rather than just cardboard cutouts of teenagers. However, my main problem here deals with some highly improbable things happening in the plot. I do not want to spoil at all, so I won't say it outright, but for coming of age films, they need to be grounded a bit in reality and not overly outlandish. In this case, this one seems highly unlikely at times, which is odd since the characters and problems are so real and well done. Yet, the plot itself just throws it off a bit at times and really needed to be more realistic.",

The film starts losing steam halfway through, probably because the premise is not that strong. One of the three characters (one of the boys) seemed to have much more potential but it did not go anywhere too interesting either. Still, a nice watch if you are not asking for much or if you are a fan of this type of stories.",

It's crazy that it has an R rating  due to some language and underage drinking (OMG people use words like  'sh_t' and 14-year-olds drink beer at parties!).  Overall, I thought that while some of the characters (the cops and parents) were overdrawn in a zaney way, the circumstances and feelings were totally relatable.  And anyway this is from the viewpoint of 14-year-old kids  who often view their parents as absurd.  To my mind, it lent itself well to the type of humor.  Overall, this is a solidly good summer movie and well worth the price of the ticket.  Grab some popcorn and sit back and enjoy yourself!",

However, the last section got a little too bittersweet and lost it seemed and the characters resolutions with each other seemed pretty forced.

The awkwardness of all the interactions with the parents are just so perfect, and it brings back all kinds of memories.  I also found it easy to sympathize with both the parents and the teenagers, which makes for a more interesting viewing experience because you can see the enormous divide between them.  Nick Offerman's character in particular was intriguing--he had the typical Nick Offerman crankiness, but it seemed toned down to the point that it was believable, and in his moments of doubt he became a fully humanized character.",
