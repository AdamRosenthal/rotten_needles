      "text": "Pegg and Frost have done it again, they've created a hilarious movie which is worth your money. Paul is the story of two friends, Graeme (Simon Pegg) and Clive (Nick Frost) who are going on a tour across america, from Comic-Con to all over america's alien hotspots. Along the way, they come across an alien named Paul (voiced by Seth Rogen) Let me get this out of the way: Just because the two main characters are \"nerds\" doesn't mean anyone who isn't one will be alienated. The jokes are crude, often come flying fast and there's enough within this movie so everyone will be entertained, including car chases, romance subplots, star wars (amongst other films) references and explosions. The jokes can often be crude, yes, but there's no doubt about how many laughs inhabit each joke: they're full of them. From probing gags to tri-titted aliens, this film is certainly a barrel full of laughs (there are better jokes, but its hard to speak of them without spoiling parts of the movie). There are a few jokes where you just have to give yourself a second to process what the character just said, and when you have processed what they just said, trust me, you'll be laughing. This film proudly bears its inspirations, by homaging some films which, trust me, once you hear them, you'll get the homage. The best homage? Listen to the background music when the characters enter the redneck bar, you'll see. Also, once Sigourney Weaver makes her on screen appearance, wait for a certain line to be referenced. I can't talk about this movie without mentioning the films title character: Paul. Seth Rogens voice doesn't bother me in any way, in fact, his voice seems perfectly suited for the CGI character, who does not stick out like a sorethumb like certain cgi-characters *cough*ScoobyDoo*cough* In fact, all of the characters are quite well done characters, none feeling like merely one dimensional characters, whether its Jane Lynch's alien enthusiast waitress, or David Koenchers redneck who severly dislikes the title characters, they also manage to pull of some brilliant laughs. A great deal of the laughs have to come from the Goverment agents, played by Bill Hader and Lo Trugillo. The duo give us some big laughs, whether its about 'Spacemans balls', searching the main characters RV or within a comic book store, you can expect big laughs from these two. Paul manages to go in a direction that i'm glad it touched upon, the creationism VS evolution debate. With Paul suddenly here, it fuels the debate (not through the whole movie though) and ponders the idea of what to do when you're beliefs have been shattered. So basically, Paul is a film filled with non-stop laughs, a brilliant cast who could act their way out of a prison and homages that are guarranteed to leave a smile on your face. Definately a contender for funniest film of the year",

Some blatant references to Star Wars, ET, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, etc., but then some subtle ones, like the country jamboree band playing the Star Wars Cantina theme ala Western style.

Don't think he wrote this but if he did, it got shredded -- could have been a lot funnier and more insightful, with a lot fewer unbelievably obvious cliches that make a big deal of being obvious so that it's like kitchy obvious as \"cool\" obvious... but totally fails in that sense, like the evangelical thing.

      "text": "Deep in the recesses of an Area 51 warehouse, a CIA-employed \"little green man\" has none other than Steven Spielberg on the line, discussing with the filmmaker, hot on the heels of his first Indiana Jones movie, what he should film next. Seated at his regulation government desk, Paul(Seth Rogen), the driving force behind all the important scientific and sociological achievements of the past fifty years, gives Spielberg the idea for \"E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial\", the 1982 classic that turns out to be, not a work of fiction, but a biopic about Paul's first contact with earthlings upon his arrival from the skies beyond. Clive Gollings(Nick Frost), a British sci-fi writer on nerd holiday with his fellow Comic-Con conventioneer Graeme(Simon Pegg), had no doubt seen \"E.T.\" as a tiny lad in some rundown London bijou, but it's the Spielberg knockoff \"Mac & Me\", the 1988 Stewart Raffill \"commercial\" that took the marketing practice of product placement to a whole other level, which inspired him down the road to write speculative fiction and sci-fi based comic books. Considering that Paul has such a prodigious grasp of the American popular culture(he takes credit for creating Fox Mulder), the savvy moviegoer would expect the hyper-urban alien to be outraged when Clive speaks of him in the same light as the \"Mysterious Alien Creature\", Mac for short, whose caretakers keep alive by supplying the co-opted alien with Coke after Coke after Coke. With his mouth fixed in a perpetual \"O\", Mac has the unintended look of a stroke victim. Hillariously, since Mac can't move his mouth, the furnished soda cans are always equipped with a straw for easy sipping, as a means to help offset the considerable limitations of the completely manual puppet. Unlike Mac who can't talk(you need facial gestures to do that), and most conspicuously, eat(ditto), Paul, on the other hand, yet another triumph of CGI technology, acts and sounds like your typical American male beset with arrested development, and in a wicked send-up of the titular character in John Carpenter's \"Starman\", eats what he regenerates. Paul may be a little on the crude side, but he never forgot his first love, Tara, whom the alien tried to make amends with over the intervening years through the cinematic arts. (In a bit of fun, fictive movie revisionism, Elliott was supposedly based on Tara.) Although Paul couldn't save the dog his ship landed on during that long ago crash landing, the alien brings the hound's memory back alive, so to speak, through the redemptive powers of film. In the final moments of \"E.T.: The Extra Terrestrial\", Elliott's dog trots up the ramp to the departing spacecraft, then thinks better of it and turns around. When Tara(Blythe Danner), the little girl who nursed Paul back to health, traverses the same sort of steps(toward Paul's ship) as that celluloidal dog, the seemingly accidental movements of a restless animal in the Spielberg film now takes on a less spontaneous appearance. Turns out the whole damn thing was scripted, a personal aside, from Paul to Tara, as an apology for taking her cherished pet away with his reckless piloting, by foregrounding the dog for a brief moment amidst the tearful goodbyes between E.T. and his humans. \"E.T.\" is a very personal movie for Paul, thus Clive's childhood fascination with \"Mac and Me\"(co-starring Ronald McDonald as himself) must stick in his crawl, but he remains respectfully quiet, perhaps even, suspiciously so. That's because \"Mac & Me\" was his idea too. It's the only explanation. He's just too embarrassed to own up to it. At the end of the Christine Ebersole vehicle, the family of mysterious alien creatures gets sworn in as American citizens, therefore choosing Earth over returning back to their desert-like planet. Paul, who probably could have quit his bureaucratic job anytime he wanted to, decides that he prefers his adopted home, as well. These two movies: \"E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial\" and \"Mac & Me\", reflect the breadth of Paul's earthly experiences; starting off as a stranger in a strange land and ending with a successful transition into fruitful assimilation.",

However, this is supposed to be a comedy movie, But it's better that there weren't any stupid laughs than had there been. It was not a very Seth Rogen-like film thank God. I'm not a Seth Rogen, I was expecting some pretty stupid stuff. It was kind of uncomfortable, there were kind of shots at religion, and it sort of made religious people seem stupid, and that hurt a lot, I am a Christian, now that doesn't really affect my views, but it could very well be taken offensive, and it got really uncomfortable. I didn't really take it seriously, and you really can't be a hard core religious nut to like it. The movie gets a 5 because the humor wasn't really there, and the constant religious strikes were not necessary. You could've easily cut it out of the movie, and it would've been a much more solid showing. But otherwise, I think  Simon Pegg and Nick Frost did a great job in it, they were very good in it.

It's not a bad comedy it's just not as good as what you'd expect it to be given their record it has his funny moments throughout but it just lacks the sophistication their other other films had and therefore at times leaves you wanting more. The story focuses upon two British geeks travelling to USA on a UFO pilgrimage however on their path come across Paul, an Alien who enlists their help to assist him in returning home, however its not long before trouble arises and their insane roadtrip see's them in a struggle against time to return Paul home. Pegg and Frost are dependable as ever but the true stars here are, first, Seth Rogen who is awesome as Paul, the twist with Jason Bateman was a great idea and Bateman's performance itself was great as was Kristen Wiig who turns in a hilarious performance.  A cameo from Jane Lynch was also very well played and for big geeks theres even a cameo from a sci-fi legend in Sigourney Weaver. All in all, Paul is at times great fun that will provide moments of laughter however its not going to live long in the memory like Shaun of the Dead or Hot Fuzz, nonetheless its certainly worth a watch and will have Sci-Fi/Alien fans in hysterics, otherwise don't expect to much.",

They play two British comic book fanatics Graeme and Clive who are fish out of water as they visit America for Comic-Con, we realise its a dream they have always wanted to happen, but their journey becomes a lot more lively when they'd happen across Paul, a foul-mouthed and socially in touch alien, voiced by Seth Rogen, he kills all the clich\u00e9s that we are told and believe of extra-terrestrial life, he swears, smokes and convinces everyone most of the entertaining sci-fi adventures of the past 60 years. The film ticks along as a comical history lesson, with Seth Rogen being the real comic force in the film as Paul the alien, while the men chasing down this other life form also hit some hysterical high notes with the serious and typical formation of what we would expect of a 'government agent' in Jason Bateman, but his two bumbling sidekicks played by Bill Hader and Jo Lo Truglio who are treating their job like first timers, and their comedy is juvenile but brilliant. This all leads into an explosive finale which combines everything we've seen and adds in a few surprises to keep it fresh and interesting.",

      "text": "\"Paul\" is unfortunately a \"nothing-special\" kind of comedy, but that doesn't mean it was \"bad\" per se. It's sporadically funny, it's well acted, and it has a solid plot and serviceable writing overall. It's not going to wow you or reinvent the comedy genre, but I would definitely say that, as a whole, it works. It's a fun watch, just nothing I imagine you'll want to go back to time and time again. Even so, \"Paul\" is a decently entertaining film that's worth one watch.",

      "text": "It feels great to sit down to movie that you can't stop laughing at and Paul is one of those movies. Paul is a great Sci-Fi Comedy with a story that you can recognize instantly, it also has a great all star cast. Now for a Sci-Fi movie, it dead one perfect, for people who grew up throughout the 60's to now will get Star Trek and Close Encounters reference that are let loose in the film. For the comedy, it wasn't perfect, and most of it came from Seth Rogen, he kinda goes all the way with his jokes, which would be alright if they weren't used so much. Now the cast of this perfect, it couldn't get any better with Simon Pegg, Nick Frost, Kristen Wiig, Jason Bateman, and Sigourney Weaver. The entire cast make the best attempt at being at their maximum performance level, and that attempt made it very great. Seth Rogen was great as Paul, but jokes like I said were very overused, but he was still great, besides I could watch this movie over and over again.",

'Paul' is also fairly exciting and nerds will love it.",
