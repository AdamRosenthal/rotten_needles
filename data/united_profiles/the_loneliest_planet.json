There are essentially two moments of drama to the film, followed by some weighty emotional repercussions, and that's it!  But hey, I felt like i was there, it made me think of my boy scout backpacking days, and in that sense, I enjoyed it.  But a great film scoring at or near perfect scores from some of these critics?  No.  I will say that it's better than another critically acclaimed film with the same pacing - Meek's Cutoff.  That sucker bored me to tears.  This movie is not boring - it just rolls at a meticulous pace, as if you're walking with the trio through a very beautiful museum.",

One climactic event in the whole story was mildly interesting and a little funny, but nothing interesting happens as a result of it. The resolution takes forever to get to and is fairly ridiculous, yet predictable. The movie gives the viewer no reason to care about any of the characters. I gave it any points at all because the scenery is beautiful. The Georgian landscape fills the screen and we're treated to some amazing, stunning shots. If the entire movie was just shots of the landscape it would've been great, but the two main characters managed to be at once obnoxious and pathetic. They made a visually stunning homage to Georgian geography into a boring and drawn out story about a couple of petty tourists.",
