Two of my boys (ages 6 and 4) found the non-graphic and relatively bloodless hunt-for-dinner scenes a little intense but they still ended up loving it (and, most importantly, sitting still for a 90-minute documentary).  I'll celebrate Earth Day by not burning Styrofoam in my driveway if you celebrate it by taking your family to see Disneynature's AFRICAN CATS.",

Anyone who watches this film is lucky to experience the incredible close-up view of these animals in the wild.  Because I am an avid animal lover, I did have to cover my eyes once or twice.  But I know that confrontations between the animals are just the unfortunate reality of the situation.  Thank You Disney.",

Jackson was a perfect narrator for this film. This movie definitely does not deserve a 61 as the critics average out on. I didn't see a negative thing about this film, it wasn't long, and it wasn't incredibly short, it got its point across and it did it well. Lions and cheetahs are beautiful creatures. This was an amazing film, disney nature keeps on delivering, Earth was great, Oceans was excellent and African Cats was captivating. I can't wait for next years Chimpanzee, monkeys are my favorite animals too haha, I give African Cats an overall 10/10. This is definitely worth a blu-ray purchase when it comes out.",

Plus, the proceeds from the movie's first week go to a good cause. There is a little too much personification and attributing human values to the animals, but I still found it quite entertaining.",
