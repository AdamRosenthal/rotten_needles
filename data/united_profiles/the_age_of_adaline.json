Age of Adaline is a fun idea with a talented cast that's hindered only by odd narrative choices, both in story and in spoken form, that force too much scientific explanation into what's happening to her.  Without spoiling any major parts of the plot, I think the story would have been better served with a more impactful ending, instead of the more upbeat one found.  The pacing was also of some concern for me - too often I asked my friends \"how far are we into this movie?\", because it felt longer than it really was.  If you're not a stickler for film and enjoy a more drama-geared movie, Adaline is not a wasted viewing experience, but for the more critical crowd, especially those that appreciate a good pace of progression, this movie will more likely leave you feeling \"meh\".",

One pleasure of this film was how well Harrison Ford looked and acted. He appeared younger than he has in some other recent movies. Sometimes he's brilliant, as in Indiana Jones. Sometimes he's very good as in Witness, and sometimes he falls totally flat as he did in What Lies Beneath or Expendables 3. Luckily here he does a great job. And the guy who portrays Ford's character as a young man was eerily spot on. The entire cast came across as comfortable with each other in a way that's rare in films. I don't know if that's due to the particular collection of actors, the director, or just really good catering, but it helped a great deal to persuade me of the credibility of the story in the face of its impossible premise.",
