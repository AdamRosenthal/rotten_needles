I mean, I'm seriously starting to think that this man picks his scripts by throwing darts at a wall. Anyway, knowing the aforementioned full well before entering the theater, \"Season of the Witch\" wasn't THAT terrible. Maybe they could have shaved off 15 minutes in the middle due to a few boring scenes... But other than that, there's some entertaining, wacky, and explosive fun to be had. And the bad acting is so bad, it's good. Try to notice the completely discordant use of accents (or lack thereof) throughout the movie. For instance, Nick Cage (the most guilty actor of the bunch) has a classical English accent in some scenes, yet no accent whatsoever in others! Brilliant... In conclusion: yeah, it's a bad movie. But you KNEW that walking in the door. So have a sense of humor, and enjoy some butt-kicking crusaders take on the supernatural.",

      "text": "Tituba's \"Barbados songs\" are best left to the imagination, but in Nicholas Hytner's adaptation of Arthur Miller's 1953 play \"The Crucible\", we see the black woman conjuring spells over a cauldron; we also see her disciples, languishing New England schoolgirls, who have gathered in the woods by moonlight for this secret assemblage with the expressed interest of quelling their unrequited passions, once and for all. Into the pot does each girl make her contribution to the love potion, mostly harmless fauna and flora, except for Abigail Williams(Winona Ryder), who brings a live chicken to the estrogen-heightened proceedings. Abigail smashes the bird on a rock, then smears the fowl's blood on her lips. In \"Season of the Witch\", a principled knight who leaves the Crusades(along with his pal Felson, played by Ron Perlman) after ruminating over the morality of killing innocent women and children(it finally hits him: hey, it's wrong!), dreams about his last victim(a woman that he speared in the chest), and in this delirious reenactment, she feasts on the blood gathered around her mouth, just like Abigail. Did the conscientious objector conjure this image on his own, or did the girl in the cage(Claire Foy), the alleged witch, put it there? John Proctor(Daniel Day Lewis) didn't believe in necromancy, and neither does Behman, which is how he allows himself to be manipulated by Anna, who convinces the runaway knight that the priest, Deblezar(Stephen Campbell), is the enemy. In this world, fourteenth century England, the church's hysteria, concerning the devil and the threat he poses to the inhabitants of the material realm, is warranted, because unlike the Massachusetts of 1692, magic exists; witches walk among the English people, many of them, victimized by the Black Plague. \"Season of the Witch\", as a result of having studied \"The Crucible\", plays topsy-turvy with the two camps: the accused(the women, the supposed witches) and the accusers(the church), when the film defies expectations when one of the sentenced women(in the film's opening scene), a confessor(unlike the Miller play, divulging one's guilt doesn't result in an automatic reprieve), turns into a demon after she is dragged out of the icy cold river water, the surprising aftermath of a public execution. It wasn't a senseless killing, after all. Whereas the prologue in the Hytner film(written by Miller himself) suggests the possibility, however slight, that the devil did reside in Salem, which to a certain degree, justifies the micro-proselytizing of the theocratic officials, the church in this \"Lord of the Rings\"-meets-\"The Exorcist\" mash-up is seen as totally in their right to round-up potential occultists for their kangaroo court. The witch hunt, with its allusions to McCarthyism, makes \"Season of the Witch\" a sort of apologist film for the red scare tactics plied by the U.S. senator on many Hollywood professionals in the nineteen-fifties, since the woman in the opening scene, and Anna, indeed do have something to hide. The church, so often portrayed as a patriarchal construct whose sole purpose is to keep robed men in power, in this otherwise forgettable and routine film, is seen as a heroic institution, vital even, since superstition(the root cause of all that goes wrong in John Proctor's world), in this cinematic domain, becomes almost indistinguishable from empirical observation. The devil isn't a psychological entity, something conjured up in the mind's eye of Abigail Williams, but rather, it's a physiological one, as seen in the monastery, home to the Key of Solomon(a book of incantations that contains a spell to break the plague), when the devil breaks loose from the girl's body.",

Most of the people who criticized the movie boldly stated from the get go that they hated Nicholas Cage. My question is, \"Why Go?\" If you want to see a neat story about witch slaying and demons, go, but if you don't like Nicholas Cage, don't bother, you will be picking it apart from the start, so why waste your money?

Nicolas Cage, and his not very admired choices of movies, played a very strong role, as a protector, a crusader, and I might add he did a fairly good job, even though he can do a lot better. As an example \"Face to Face\". In general it's a history type movie showing the crusades, combined with magic and death, this is the very short version. See it, and you'll find out that if you enjoy films having the characteristics mentioned earlier you will be impressed, at least in two or three action phases. Not incredible special effects, but well and off a movie which will probably be forgotten sooner than you can say. Underestimated from every aspect, but as a conclusion not that bad. Not much more to say, see it, rate it, and move on.",

I would call it a supernatural thriller that is not that thrilling. It looks cheaply made, you can tell by how Nicolas Cage is speaking, he always seems to be shouting. I'll put it this way; costumes production and design are good. Editing and visual effects are definitely not. The cinematography was crude with the film being dark, dusty and foggy in almost every scene. The dialogue wasn't bad but the fact that it changes from Let's drink to Kill her doesn't really make it well played out. It has a B movie aesthetic to it. The film was pieced together terribly with bad cliche's. They put the genre of the movie in between horror and historical thriller, a mix that doesn't go together really well. They made the movie too long by putting unneeded dialogue and bad special effects that delay the overall story line. Cut out all that and it might just catch somebodies eye without them leaving the movie theatre with a frown on their face.",

The only thing that  felt forced was the character introductions, and the pacing was moving along so quickly. The part where the new comer alter boy joins the quest, was so cliched. Just fight with blandly arranged choreography and go. Anyway the ending was flat-out horribly cheesy, I don't seem to take the main antagonistic demon to be taken seriously.

The premise seems thrilling enough, but SEASON OF THE WITCH is sabotaged by its incompetent special effects and unworthy cast. The period setting which director Dominic Sena tries to convey is drowned out by poorly computerized environments that generate a sense of artifice on screen. What makes matters worse are the laughable performances by Nicholas Cage and Ron Perlman, who can't be bothered with simple things like diction or accent when it comes to creating a convincing 14th-century character. Sena doesn't allow for much suspense when we are quickly given glimpses into the witch's powers, leaving behind a long and perilous viewing experience instead. For a superior take on the same theme, be sure to check out Christopher Smith's BLACK DEATH from 2010.",
