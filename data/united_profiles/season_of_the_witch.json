I mean, I'm seriously starting to think that this man picks his scripts by throwing darts at a wall. Anyway, knowing the aforementioned full well before entering the theater, \"Season of the Witch\" wasn't THAT terrible. Maybe they could have shaved off 15 minutes in the middle due to a few boring scenes... But other than that, there's some entertaining, wacky, and explosive fun to be had. And the bad acting is so bad, it's good. Try to notice the completely discordant use of accents (or lack thereof) throughout the movie. For instance, Nick Cage (the most guilty actor of the bunch) has a classical English accent in some scenes, yet no accent whatsoever in others! Brilliant... In conclusion: yeah, it's a bad movie. But you KNEW that walking in the door. So have a sense of humor, and enjoy some butt-kicking crusaders take on the supernatural.",

      "text": "Tituba's \"Barbados songs\" are best left to the imagination, but in Nicholas Hytner's adaptation of Arthur Miller's 1953 play \"The Crucible\", we see the black woman conjuring spells over a cauldron; we also see her disciples, languishing New England schoolgirls, who have gathered in the woods by moonlight for this secret assemblage with the expressed interest of quelling their unrequited passions, once and for all. Into the pot does each girl make her contribution to the love potion, mostly harmless fauna and flora, except for Abigail Williams(Winona Ryder), who brings a live chicken to the estrogen-heightened proceedings. Abigail smashes the bird on a rock, then smears the fowl's blood on her lips. In \"Season of the Witch\", a principled knight who leaves the Crusades(along with his pal Felson, played by Ron Perlman) after ruminating over the morality of killing innocent women and children(it finally hits him: hey, it's wrong!), dreams about his last victim(a woman that he speared in the chest), and in this delirious reenactment, she feasts on the blood gathered around her mouth, just like Abigail. Did the conscientious objector conjure this image on his own, or did the girl in the cage(Claire Foy), the alleged witch, put it there? John Proctor(Daniel Day Lewis) didn't believe in necromancy, and neither does Behman, which is how he allows himself to be manipulated by Anna, who convinces the runaway knight that the priest, Deblezar(Stephen Campbell), is the enemy. In this world, fourteenth century England, the church's hysteria, concerning the devil and the threat he poses to the inhabitants of the material realm, is warranted, because unlike the Massachusetts of 1692, magic exists; witches walk among the English people, many of them, victimized by the Black Plague. \"Season of the Witch\", as a result of having studied \"The Crucible\", plays topsy-turvy with the two camps: the accused(the women, the supposed witches) and the accusers(the church), when the film defies expectations when one of the sentenced women(in the film's opening scene), a confessor(unlike the Miller play, divulging one's guilt doesn't result in an automatic reprieve), turns into a demon after she is dragged out of the icy cold river water, the surprising aftermath of a public execution. It wasn't a senseless killing, after all. Whereas the prologue in the Hytner film(written by Miller himself) suggests the possibility, however slight, that the devil did reside in Salem, which to a certain degree, justifies the micro-proselytizing of the theocratic officials, the church in this \"Lord of the Rings\"-meets-\"The Exorcist\" mash-up is seen as totally in their right to round-up potential occultists for their kangaroo court. The witch hunt, with its allusions to McCarthyism, makes \"Season of the Witch\" a sort of apologist film for the red scare tactics plied by the U.S. senator on many Hollywood professionals in the nineteen-fifties, since the woman in the opening scene, and Anna, indeed do have something to hide. The church, so often portrayed as a patriarchal construct whose sole purpose is to keep robed men in power, in this otherwise forgettable and routine film, is seen as a heroic institution, vital even, since superstition(the root cause of all that goes wrong in John Proctor's world), in this cinematic domain, becomes almost indistinguishable from empirical observation. The devil isn't a psychological entity, something conjured up in the mind's eye of Abigail Williams, but rather, it's a physiological one, as seen in the monastery, home to the Key of Solomon(a book of incantations that contains a spell to break the plague), when the devil breaks loose from the girl's body.",

For instance, some of the acting is just horrible(the supporting characters were just really, really bad. Also, during many parts in this movie, they are just talking, which I'm fine with, but there isn't a point to anything they're saying! If they actually had a point to what they were doing, it would be OK, but they don't. One more thing that was extremely stupid was if what happened was supposed to happen, then this whole journey they take could have been avoided.

In one comment that I read, a critic stated that Nicholas Cage transitioned back an forth between his own voice and an English accent, but I never heard this happen once. Most of the people who criticized the movie boldly stated from the get go that they hated Nicholas Cage. My question is, \"Why Go?\" If you want to see a neat story about witch slaying and demons, go, but if you don't like Nicholas Cage, don't bother, you will be picking it apart from the start, so why waste your money?

It's a quest/journey story too... So, not a Hollywood blockbuster at all, but a low key twisty indie horror road trip with tension and some complexity that worked for me.  I don't usually like supernatural movies, but this one felt genuine to me.  I feel like this was marketed to blockbuster or dragon-slayer audiences, and it isn't that.  It is more about the mixed feelings you have about the witch.  I thought it did a better job than the much better rated \"Witch\" 2016 at that.",
