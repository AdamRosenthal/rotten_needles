After \"Spy Kids 3D: Game Over\" and \"The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl\" were poorly received, Robert Rodriguez was determined to give it another go with \"Shorts,\" but unfortunately, he didn't really do a great job with it. While the idea of a number of short films combining into one story might seem like a great idea, the film itself just isn't very charming, funny, or entertaining at all. And while the film seems to be aiming at children, I'm sure children might even find themselves getting bored by this film. In all honesty, I really hope that in 2009, if your kids really wanted to see a live-action \"kiddy film,\" you took them to \"Aliens in the Attic\" instead, because at least that movie was competent. \"Shorts\" is incredibly bland, and unless you feel like torturing yourself a lot, or need some kind of kid's film for \"Bad Movie Night,\" make it a point to ignore this film.",
