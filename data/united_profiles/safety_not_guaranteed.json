It's all the \"you're stupid\" blank stares you've come to love from her character in Parks and Rec...only for way longer. The same goes for Jake Johnson, who makes you think he is going to be hilarious for the whole film until you realize he's really just the cliche alcoholic **** writer with a silly story arc of his own in the film that has literally no payoff or relevance to the overall plot. With that being said, Mark Duplass as the paranoid time traveler is just really fantastic. His character distracted me from Plaza and Johnson's super indie, first world problematics and gave me a reason to stay awake for the entire film. He even performs a beautiful song somewhere near the end. But then there's \"the end.\" I've heard other critics give the ending of this movie a lot of praise. To be frank, I don't know why. It has a good ending the same way The Sopranos had a good ending. It just ends. So if you're looking for the heartfelt, dramatic comedy romp with a wild storyline and goosebumps-inducing ending...you're not going to get it. But I suppose if you have an hour and a half to spare, you can start this film up and enjoy Duplass being a stupidly good actor.",

The acting from Aubrey Plaza, Mark Duplass, Jake Johnson, and Karan Soni, is great and very authentic. These people truly feel like real human beings and because of that, you can really identify with them. This is in large part thanks to the very good acting and the very good writing. The story really strikes a chord with you and the way it is presented is very good. I also like the the combination of comedy, romance, and sci-fi here. All are very well done and provide enough to keep your interest high. Overall, Safety Not Guaranteed is a funny, charming, touching, and exciting, little film that is worthy of the small amount of praise it got, though it may even deserve a bit more. It is not one of the best films ever, but it is a fun little watch that makes the hour and a half fly by like nothing.",

Ultimately however, the film descends into the sort of hipster drivel that we are seeing more of lately and the final product just seems to lack cohesion. It's one of those movies where after seeing the trailer you don't know how they could possibly make a full film based on what you've seen. I should probably start trusting my instincts when I feel that way about a preview, instead of deciding to watch a film based on the reviews and/or out of curiosity after seeing a head-scratching trailer.",
