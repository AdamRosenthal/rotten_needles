Ms. Travers was obviously an unlikeable, thankless character in real life, and her entrance into the sugary sweet Disney Studios is mostly fun to watch.  She insists on being part of the creative process of putting the film together or she won't sign over the rights to the film.  Her demands are exasperating (\"No Music\") or ridiculous (\"No color red in the film\") and she drives the creative team crazy.  Tom Hanks does a nice job as Disney, and even looks a little like him in the eyes.  Overall it was fun but not something I would want to see again.",

      "text": "La genesi di \u2018Mary Poppins\u2019, film amato da generazioni di ragazzi in tutto il mondo (ma non dal sottoscritto), fu lunga e travagliata: non tanto perch\u00e8 fu il primo lungometraggio disneyano con attori in carne e ossa, quanto per i bastoni messi tra le ruote da P.L. Travers, la scrittrice britannica autrice dei libri dedicati alla supergovernante. Il corteggiamento per avere i diritti richiese molto tempo e i paletti messi dalla scrittrice per la trasposizione \u2013 no al musical, no all\u2019animazione, no al rosso \u2013 furono infine forzati da Walt in persona vincendo la scommessa commerciale, ma assicurandosi il risentimento a vita della donna. Il film racconta questo lungo lavoro di convincimento (e un po\u2019 di coercizione), concentrandosi principalmente sulla trasferta hollywoodiana di Travers, che si ritrova catapultata in un mondo che non capisce \u2013 o che si rifiuta di capire \u2013 con quasi solo l\u2019eccezione del rapporto che nasce con l\u2019occhialuto autista Ralph. In parallelo, c\u2019\u00e8 la narrazione della genesi autobiografica di \u2018Mary Poppins\u2019 attraverso i flashback che illustrano il tenero rapporto dell\u2019autrice con il padre durante la di lui discesa verso la rovina e la morte nell\u2019Outback australiano: la rivolta del signor Banks \u2013 il padre dei ragazzi affidati a Mary \u2013 \u00e8 la rivincita regalata al proprio genitore per interposto personaggio. Questo doppio binario \u00e8 il punto debole pi\u00f9 evidente della pellicola: il dramma che si svolge nei ricordi mal si combina con il tono in prevalenza di commedia del filone principale anche perch\u00e9 la rappresentazione \u00e8 di maniera, malgrado la fotografia da cartolina (John Schwartzman \u00e8 il responsabile della parte visiva) e le sentite interpretazioni di Colin Farrell e della giovane Annie Rose Buckley. Lascia poi perplessi che la sceneggiatura (di Kelly Marcel e Sue Smith) tratti in modo cos\u00ec frettoloso la figura di zia Ellie (Rachel Griffiths), che sta alla base della figura di Mary Poppins, anche se non riesce a \u2018mettere a posto le cose\u2019: ben diversi sono il ritmo e la godibilit\u00e0 della narrazione al \u2018presente\u2019, dove la bravura degli attori e la possibilit\u00e0 di giocare con le situazioni pi\u00f9 contrastate aiutano ad alzare il livello in modo considerevole. Il lavoro quotidiano della costruzione del film \u2013 le musiche, l\u2019animazione, le caratteristiche dei personaggi (dal signor Banks alla discussione sul nome da dare a sua moglie) \u2013 si scontra con i dubbi di Travers, ma \u00e8 costantemente supportato dall\u2019incoraggiamento e dalla partecipazione di Walt in persona. Ovviamente il tutto \u00e8 edulcorato, ma sarebbe anche stato difficile pretendere che un film disneyano parlasse male del padre fondatore, e c\u2019\u00e8 qualche forzatura che per\u00f2 migliora la resa drammatica (Disney non and\u00f2 mai in Inghilterra per convincere la riottosa controparte,  ma la telefonata reale avrebbe avuto molta meno efficacia sullo schermo), ma in questa parte il film sa coinvolgere fino a culminare nella scena madre della prima proiezione. Lo stesso Hancock che filma in modo abbastanza banale il segmento australiano sembra trovare qui un\u2019altra sensibilit\u00e0, come se fosse pi\u00f9 in sintonia con questi momenti: di certo, come gi\u00e0 detto, lo aiutano una scrittura pi\u00f9 serrata e un cast di notevole sicurezza. Circondati da impeccabili professionisti fra i quali spicca l\u2019umanit\u00e0 dolente che Paul Giamatti regala a Ralph, Thompson e Hanks interpretano con grande finezza i personaggi principali interagendo con classe ed evitando di prevaricare. L\u2019attrice inglese riesce a restituire appieno la figura di una donna scorbutica e fragile (scorbutica perch\u00e9 fragile), mentre Hanks si cala a fondo nei panni di un Walt non si sa quanto vicino a quello reale \u2013 l\u2019attore \u00e8 riuscito per\u00f2 a imporre un accenno al fumo che il vero Disney neg\u00f2 sempre in pubblico \u2013 ma che, con quella voce calda e suadente, avrebbe convinto anche i sassi.",

      "text": "Saving Mr. Banks is an excellent film. It contains a lot of heart and soul and I really liked it. I liked the acting and locations in this film; Tom Hanks did a great job playing Walt Disney and Emma Thompson did a great job playing P.L. Travers. The only problem I have in this movie were some of the errors in this film like there are a few things you'll see in this movie that may have been after it's time like in the Disneyland scenes, I may have seen an attraction or two that may have not been open yet. But if you ignore those errors, you will find Saving Mr. Banks to be a very good movie that tells the story of the making of Mary Poppins.",

It tells the story of how the making of the movie took place, as well as the backstory behind the original Mary Poppins book. With a healthy mix of humor and emotion throughout, it manages to be a consistently enjoyable experience. It's also exceptionally well-cast. Emma Thompson, Tom Hanks, and the rest of the cast give fantastic performances.",

My other objection is that the real life situation has been significantly altered, which isn't a bad thing unless you can really notice it while watching the movie, like I did.",

And most essentially, she is at the top of her game in depicting a quite unlikeable character, the high and mighty spinster P.L. Travers, the author of Mary Poppins books.",

No matter if your young or old this is a great movie to watch, and the acting is spectacular.  I have always loved Paul Giamatti every since Cinderella Man and in this movie he puts forth another great piece of acting, too what can you say about Hanks that hasn't been already said he is top notch in his portrayal of Walt Disney.  Great flick and one if you haven't seen that will give you your money's worth of entertainment!!",
