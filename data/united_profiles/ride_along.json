Alright i think we all know Tim Story has directed some crap movies his worst of course being the two Fantastic Four movies but this movie is actually the first movie i like of his also i wonder how much Jason Mantzoukas had to do with the script because that guy is freaking hilarious. Okay most of the time i like seeing John Leguizamo in movies but this time i just found him to be  annoying also i totally wasn't expecting Laurence Fishburne to be in this movie and i was surprised when he walked into the scene and while his character is \"the bad guy\" he never really seems convincing.",

The chemistry between cube and hart was pretty good but with a so,I'd script and director I think they could be great together.  It's very formulaic in the story structure, characters are not too deep (doesn't need to be in a comedy but depth still helps) as with most movies, especially comedies dumb things people say or act  that would never happen in real life do happen in the movie for the sole sake of moving the story forward. There's no real tension and I think it just comes from a weak script and the directing could have been miles better.",

Although the chemistry of Ice Cube and Kevin Hart is good, Hart's manic demeanour becomes overbearing sometimes. The buddy cop genre is terribly cliched but a little more effort in story and characters would have gone a long way to making this a better film.

Ice Cube, however, sounds as if he's a franksenstinian amalgamation of cliche'd overworked cops that we've seen time and time again. The plot is clustered and unfocused, the relationship between Hart and Ice Cube makes little sense, starting off rough, as was intended, and follows through with that until the very end, with little to no form of development in between barring the insane amount of slapstick humour. The plot is clustered and non-sensical, and, unfortunately, even though the entire focus of the movie is the jokes, it fails at that miserably.
