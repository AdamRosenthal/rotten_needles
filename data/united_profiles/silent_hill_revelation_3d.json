My favorite part was how they intertwined the First film perfectly and still kept the film true to silent hill 3. I.e. Happy Burger, the mall, theme park etc. The only negatives for me were the portrayals of Vincent and Douglas. Vincent was too Good as opposed to the game. And Douglas was simply cut down to a minor character. Also I understand alot of fans will be angry because of Pyramid Head being in the film, but they need to understand, PYRAMID HEAD WASNT A MANIFESTATION OF JAMES SUNDERLANDS FEARS, THE CREATOR SAID THAT HIMSELF.

Of course their are some plot holes that make you wonder if the writer was writing a script or a jumbled mess on paper but the major selling point for this film is obviously for the fan service and this film really delivers. The monster effects mixed in with the 3D effects will blow you away and certain scenes will leave you amazed and thirsting for more. Unfortunately, the real killing blow of the movie is it's length.

I thought the trailers looked more like a parody of silent hill, but upon seeing the movie it's even WORSE than I thought it would be. Not only does it completely massacre the content it's supposed to be paying tribute to, the movie is one of the worst I've ever seen in my entire life. The acting is terrible, script is phoned in, special effects are mediocre at best. It's not even remotely scary or suspenseful. The characters' roles are all rearranged, some characters who were important in the game were killed off within 5 minutes of first seeing them, with no lasting impact on the viewer whatsoever. Fan service was shoehorned in all over the place and with the exception of one moment toward the end, it always felt out of place. I seriously felt like I was watching a really bad fan fiction come to life. Probably the most common defense I see of this movie is that a movie adaptation can't hit all the exact plot points of what it's based on, or it wouldn't be interesting to people who've played the game already. That's true in some cases but definitely not this one. The reason people complain about the plot changes is because they don't add any new dynamics to the story, they just water it down and strip any meaning they once had or any purpose they served. The result is a mess of a bunch of different things that don't make sense together, and whatever does make sense turned out pretty damn insipid. Evil clowns eating flesh burgers?

Honestly I think the reason that it did so badly was because I had no idea the movie was even coming out because I never seen a preview on TV or in the theatres, and the movie opened on the weekend that everyone is out celebrating Halloween. Lets face it... Video Game fans most definitely take advantage of the Halloween holiday! I think you should see the movie and decide for yourself.

Yes it follows the 3rd game and yes it changes aspects, the main characters and some of the plot elements, but the main bulk of the story is there. Visually Michael Basset has made a stunning movie, with some clever directing and ingenious set and creature design. (red pyramid always being a highlight) I found the plot self explanatory (with a little too much exposition) i feel there could be a better, longer directors cut somewhere, (i feel a extra 20mins  which enables the first 3rd of the movie to breathe a little better. Some of the dialogue was clunky but this is mainly because of the exposition, however it doesn't ruin or detract from the experience. The music is outstanding as ever with direct music cues from the game (most definitely a good thing) The only real downside was Vincent who didn't really work that well and to be honest wasn't needed, but again this does not ruin or detract from the movie. Tension is well handled and some of the scenes graphic and chilling. The 3d is handled well, with a few gimmicky bits but mostly bringing you into the misty town of silent hill in ways never before accomplished.",

The first twenty minutes were somewhat suspenseful, slightly intense, and pretty much on par with the first film (for the record, I actually enjoyed the first SH flick). After that, it's as if Paul W.S. Anderson assumed filming duties and everything went to complete crap. Hilariously bad monster design, corny dialog, Malcom McDowell's apparent winging of his performance after coming to terms with reality and the film he signed for, and enough 3D IN YOUR FACE moments to induce 4D vomiting- those are reasons enough for me to stop there.  So, after trudging through that mess, we arrive at the final scene in the movie, the excrement on the urine-flavored cake: ***SPOILERS AHEAD*** In just one of many forced plot twists in this film, Heather summons Pyramid Head, who, with all his might, rushes to Heather's aid. I'm aware this reflects upon a scene in the first movie, but in this film they may as well have given Pyramid Head a cape and cowl because they couldn't have made his heroic presence more obvious.",

The 3-D wasn't used as the films selling point. Rather, it enhanced the movie. Making the beautiful sets and characters come to life! It was easy enough to follow, (even for those who haven't played the game) and yet stuck with the games. Not only was the art quality great, you'll fall in love with the main protagonists; Heather and Vincent. (Adelaide Clemens and Kit Harington) The only downfall was the films length. While it deserved at least a 2 1/2 hour time slot, it fell short with 1 hour and 34 minutes. This however, should not keep you from seeing this masterpiece of a creepy thriller. Maybe the resident evil series should just take a backseat and watch how Silent Hill does it.",

The story was NOT supposed to follow the events of the games and that is something that the fans have to understand  all gaming movies do the same  and it's not that bad. The only thing I didn't like about the story was the ending  especially Claudia's role and what she becomes in the finale. The ending was just too...cliched maybe. Also the movie was at least a bit scary at the beginning, but when the Darkness finally engulfs Silent Hill, it has the opposite effect of what the viewer would expect  all the horror is simply gone  which I think was the biggest mistake of the movie, at least when talking about the horror aspect. Then the soundtrack was definitely one of the strongest aspects of the movie  I'm listening to it right now on Youtube. The actors also did a good job, which I didn't expect after seeing some sneak peaks.

The acting is subpar in most of the characters, and there is way too much exposition. The set pieces are excellent, and some of the creatures are inspired, but the climax was rushed and the general pacing of the movie was poor. If you are indeed a super hardcore Silent Hill fan, then this movie will address many canonical issues that are largely unexplored in the games and deal with various fan-based theories. There are also so many references to each game in the franchise, including Downpour, that hardly a shot goes by without one coming in somewhere.

The flaw of the film I think it's the script a bit too simpleminded but still full of surprises. The strength of the film are the sets (very similar to the game) monsters (and many really well done) and the atmosphere. But I must say that I found the special effects a little fake. Then let me tell you that in the end there will be a clash, but can be spectacular, but that did not seem suitable for a film like SH. Great songs Yamaoka. A film that must be seen from without high expectations but that is not bad (even if I consider the first best).",

The plot sort of based around the plot of Silent Hill 3 with Heather Mason, she starts having nightmares about Silent Hill and eventually starts seeing these things in real life. If you know the game, you know the general plot of this movie bar a few minor swaps and changes which may make it more interesting to some people? I don't know, I just kept pointing out mistakes to the people I was with who had never played Silent Hill 3. (They didn't like the movie either, by the way.)  The jump scares do scare you, but it doesn't really build up any kind of suspense as you know when the music starts to go quiet that something is going to scream, or a loud noise is going to attempt to frighten you. It did start to annoy me after a while, because it was less of a horror movie and more of a \"Loud noise, be scared\" movie.    The 3D aspect of the movie wasn't that bad, the fog and ash effects were nice, especially in transitions to the other world, but one scene that stuck out for me was the mannequin monster, the CGI was so bad that I burst out laughing like most of the audience in my showing of the movie, and I think it wins the award for one of the worst CGIs I have seen.    The last few minutes of the movie were pretty terrible, I really disliked the use of Pyramid Head and it just seemed to be queuing itself up for another sequel, with either Travis or the guy from the most recent game, Downpour as the main characters instead of the Masons.    Overall, the movie might be okay if you like jump scare movies or don't know anything about Silent Hill, but if you know about the Video Game, hate pointless jump scares or want a good horror movie, avoid this one. The reason it gets a three from me is because the 3D wasn't terrible, and some of the effects were nice, and while the plot wasn't a complete betrayal, it didn't make much sense in a few aspects.",

If you enjoyed the games, there are ample reasons for you to be satisfied with the movie. For starters, the Silent Hill movies are a rare commodity, they are not created often enough! I saw the trailer and waited three weeks to see the movie in theaters. Paid over $12 a ticket, would have gladly paid more. If I had to drive three hours to have seen it, I would have done so. The movie itself has a large amount of 3D (if you have any doubt, watch it and compare it to others such as SAW 3D and you will see the difference). The monsters in the movie closely resemble those in the games, with a few differences and original creations tossed in. In addition, both the detective as well as heather herself closely resemble the in-game characters. Few movies have done such a wonderful job choosing such incredible matches such as these. Moreover, the music, atmosphere, and various other minor elements (red shoe in the motel, Apt 106 selection, amusement park, mall, et cetera) all contribute to a warm feeling of familarity  to any Silent Hill 3 fan - and who can forget the bus at the end of the movie?! Conversely, the movie does have its weak points. Some of the acting was the best, as well as a bit of a few cheesy verbal lines spoken by Vincent. Also, depending on the theater, the lighting can be quite dim for the 3D glasses causing a difficulty in visuals. Lastly, the movie does take an alternative path on the story plot. However, otherwise, anyone who has played the game will easily have foreseen a possible NC-17 rating slap on the former ending to the game if it was redone in movie format.",

      "text": "I find Silent Hill: Revelation to be just perfect for the movie based on Silent Hill 3 and on the video game on the whole. Adelaide Clemens looks and acts absolutely like Heather from the video game. The setting is horrifying enough, white-gray foggy outside scenes follow rust-bloody shots of the inner side of the most scary and mysterious city. A lot of scenes are taken from the game, that's a nice gift for its fans. The plot is really interesting and twisty and it's understandable for everyone, not only video game fans who know the background of the story (like it happened with the first movie). The script is well-thought out, the dialogues sound realistic, the connection to the first movie is clearly explained. Silent Hill 2 has not come down to just an expensive video clip full of visual effects like what happened to the latest Resident Evil movies where the whole script can be written on just one sheet of paper with the most informative dialogues being: \"I need to recharge ammo\", \"Cover me\" and \"Run. I'll try and stall them to give you time to get clear.\" The monsters are disgusting and creepy, every motion they execute curdles the blood. The unceasing gritting sounds and even piano music create an atmosphere of true horror. I just think Silent Hill 2 could be a little bit longer, the time in the movie theatre passed too fast, but that's not a big bit of complaint. Well, I think it is a must-watch movie, containing a lot of outstanding features of the video game (which can satisfy the most devoted fan of the game), but being a good independent movie for every horror lover to enjoy.",

And for the people saying that the bad reviews are only given by people who didn't play the game, WRONG. I've played every Silent Hill game outside of the arcade game and that has no bearing on the fact that this film is terrible. It fails spectacularly on every level, in fact. The actors feel like they are completely phoning it in, the cgi monsters are so over the top they come off as comic rather than scary, and ya know what, I'm just going to say it, Why is Pyramid Head protecting Heather? Also why is he running rides at Lakeview? Why is Vincent suddenly a 20 something hipster love interest? And last but certainly not least, why on earth is the transition to the otherworld generally denoted here by mass amounts of melted saran wrap?",

The plot is dead basic and I think even the most diehard horror fan would find themselves debating whether to leave or not after the first ten goofy minutes of this hilarious nonevent of a movie. Its a shame that Sean Bean who can be one of the scariest actors out there is relegated to a small support role and isn't onscreen for very long.

The film still manages to maintain the look of the first film despite it's lower budget. And still has some atmosphere present within it. The monsters still looked very much it's predecessor's. The acting was still decent aside from some mediocre accents.The main drawback of the film was forced reliance on jumpscares. Personally I could've done without them.  And it's rapid pacing  which made the film feel rushed. ( The first film was 125 minutes, this film was only 94 minutes. The hugging scene was cheesy and kinda weak. The final battle between pyramid Head and the missionary was entertaining albeit brief and not fitting for horror film. Overall an average horror sequel and a servicable adaptation despite it's numerous changes and retcons. But I'm still hungry for at least one more film. Overall 62/100",
