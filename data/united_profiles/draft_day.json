This movie is just plain fun but totally by the numbers as it shows the gamesmanship in the War Rooms as General Manager's & Coaches livelihood is affected by the decisions they make.  The players are just pieces of meat with a certain shelf life.  The sad part is everyone gets paid except the diehard fans who have to suffer with bad decisions by management and the players whose only purpose is to be a free agent mercenary.as in Show Me The Money.  The higher they're drafted the more money and security they get.  I wish I could say there was some suspense in the movie but the truth is you know what Kevin Costner is going to do 15 minutes into the movie.  Diehard football fans will enjoy this.  Anyone else not into pro football don't waste your time.  As for the ending it is preposterous as no number seven pick is ever worth what they traded it for.  The only thing better would have been to see how the players drafted turned out.  Unfortunately, the movie ends with draft.  Just another propaganda piece for the NFL.",

I don't mind the embellishments or improbability of some of the situations. After all, it's a movie, not a documentary.

The involving of actual drafts and the excitement its creates for its rapid fans helps explain why a non-sport event generate so much interest and passion.
