      "text": "I really wanted to see this movie, and after seeing it, I wanted to like it.  However, this movie is flat out terrible.  It's a shame, because Woody Harrelson is truly amazing in his role.  He's in literally every scene and does everything he can to carry the movie.  After his performance though, there isn't one other redeeming aspect of this movie.  There is basically NO plot, and the little there is doesn't make any sense.  Not because it's complicated, but because it never goes anywhere, and when it does the writers seem to withhold certain aspects of the plot.  They must do this to create some sort of \"mystery\", but the plot is so simple that it's not necessary.  When the movie does end, I still didn't fully understand what the he** happened for what was a very dull 2 hours.  This wasn't the intention of writers, it was a lazy half-a$$ed script.  EVERYBODY behind the scenes of this movie should be disgusted with themselves, for bringing their D game at best, when Woody brought his A game.  What a wasted performance, and just proof that you need a whole lot more than a strong acting performance to make a movie good... or even halfway decent for that matter.",

      "text": "Don't listen to these other \"users,\" who apparently want some simple little story with a clearly spelled out plot and well specified resolution. Instead, this is a great character study of a complicated, many sided, tightly wound sociopath decompensating (a psychiatric term) under the stress of a hundred different things falling apart in his previously well (albeit precariously)-structured life. Harrelson and the director beautifully convey both  these different sides and this decompensation., and it's a joke that he and at least some of the other members of this striking ensemble cast (e.g., Ned Beatty, Robin Wright, Ben Foster. Bree Larsen, to name a few) haven't been nominated for Oscars, particularly given the other nominees. Great direction by Moverman (whose first feature The Messenger was also very moving) and cinematography ny Bukowski.This clearly isn't a movie for everyone, especially those who prefer sleeky, feel good, emotionally manipulative movies such as War Horse (ugh), Extremely Loud..., and The Help; and its exclusion from the Oscar list speaks volumes about the mindset and aesthetic of the average Academy member. There are a few wrong notes and an unnecessary scene taken straight out of Shame; but overall, I strongly recommend this movie for those who aren't easily disturbed and who aren't just seeking out pleasant diversions.",

Woody is excellent in the lead role, bringing wit, humor, and more compassion than I expected, but as a huge The Shield fan, I kept found myself comparing his role to that of Vic Mackie and the strike team.  The key difference is that Date Rape's character is a lone wolf, Vietnam Vet who is extremely intelligent and obviously far more tortured.  I'm not a huge fan of the ending - which seems to be a trend in movies over the last couple of years. I remember trying it in a writing seminar and got destroyed for it.

The subject matter was repulsive and the characters (especially Harrelson's) were entirely unlikable and off-putting. The camera work at times was horrendous. There was one scene where three characters were talking and for some unknown reason they decided to have the camera continuously spin between the characters, which was nauseating to say the least.
