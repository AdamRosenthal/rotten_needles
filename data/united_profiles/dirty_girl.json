I've tried to review the plot and the over the top cartoonish characters to no avail. Nothing I will write will encourage you that this movie has any redeeming values. This movie should honestly be rated at a 1. However there is a genuine warmth to Jeremy Dozier's overweight, quietly funny, decidedly gay teenage character looking for the impossibilities of love or fitting in or escaping his buffoonish father. Jeremy conveys the desire to flaunt his personality tempered by the realistic understanding of what happens if you do. Matching and exceeding his acting chops is Juno Temple. She transcends the writer's ideas of a teen looking for a father she doesn't know to escape a life she hates. She plays the slutish impulsive blonde teen to perfection as the movie opens up . You really just want to loathe her, but where a lesser actress would jump into scenes with whiplash she organically reveals herself as a full realistic character who is more than just an easy score.",

The movie is mediocre at best and after seeing the writer/director, Juno Temple, and a surprise appearance by Melissa Manchester at the Castro I wanted to like it more.  The likely mostly gay crowd at the Castro hootted, guffawed and hissed, but it all felt forced.  The comedy is way to broad and most of the characters are caricatures (the chubby gay boy, the hateful homophobic dad, the school bully).  I too was a chubby (closeted) gay teen in the early 80's right across the Red River in Texas, so should have been able to relate, but the connection just wasn't there.  Although some will find the flour-sack baby cloying, I didn't mind it and thought it could have worked in a better movie.  The two saving graces I found were the 80's songs, some of which were obvious and others more subtle, and Juno Temple.  There was one scene at the end between her and Tim McGraw that was truly beautiful and didn't fit in with the rest of the movie.  I was kind of blown away when she came out and I learned that she is actually British.  I went so far as to pull up IMDB after the show to see if I had sen her before (small parts in Atonement and Greenberg), but her work in this film, and especially that one scene, indicate the girl can act if she is given the right role.",

I didn't love the way this film seemingly used the same few 80's pop hits to repeatedly drive the point home the film took place in the 80's!
