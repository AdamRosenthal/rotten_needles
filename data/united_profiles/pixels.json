The comedy was slapstick as always however it didnt connect very well in this movie. I did laugh about 3 or 4 times but it wasnt like some of the laughs I had in other comedies. The plot was non-nonsensical in that there was no adversary characterization except for a few words that Q-Bert made about his race.

I struggle to even call this a movie, because what it devolves into is one of two things: Adam Sandler staring at the screen blanking thinking its hilarious, and the \"actors\" pointing at things and going \"Oh look, its (insert game character)! Remember that?\" Literally the only thing that keeps this movie from somehow making it into the negatives is Peter Dinklage. I remember him being in this movie alone sold me on the idea. Boy was that a mistake. Him being the standout actor is about as impressive as beating six year olds at chess. My recommendation? Stay as far away from this movie as possible.

It's also got forced relationships between Adam Sandler and Michelle Monaghan and even Josh Gad and Ashley Benson. And Kevin James is just awful as the President. THE PRESIDENT! As far as the action sequences with the arcade games, they are fantastic to watch. The whole Pac-Man scene in particular is just outstanding to watch (if you ignore the idiotic comedy in between). But what's sad about \"Pixels\", a movie about arcade video games, is that they are barely in the movie. They probably only make up about 25% of the entire movie. The other 75% is focused on our terrible main characters, their childishly idiotic humor and their annoying sub-plots that have nothing to do with a movie about video games attacking earth. Overall, the fun action sequences are mostly pushed to the side thanks the movies terrible writing and crappy characters. I give \"Pixels\" a D-!

It doesn\u2019t really hit a market because it\u2019s not Nerdy enough for Nerds, and the humour is way too juvenile so will only entertain fans of Adam Sandlers previous comedies or children and even then it will not appease Adam Sandler fans because the rating doesn\u2019t allow them to do enough swearing or his usual lowest common denominator gags that somehow entertain people.  The 3D effects mean that the 2D version which I saw didn\u2019t really work which will limit it\u2019s appeal on DVD and the cast is either really awful or too over qualified for this film and poorly directed.  It\u2019s just a mess on every level!! I didn\u2019t find it very funny and I didn\u2019t find it very thrilling.  I was just bored by it and I was glad to go.  It just doesn\u2019t work on any level.  I am probably going to forget about it as soon as I have finished this review.  There are several continuity errors, plot holes and a couple of video game characters that were made after 1982 that turn up in the film un-explicably.  They just didn\u2019t care!!",

The references to 80's video games are all over the place and make a video game fan like myself revel in the joy of its immense premise. In addition, the plot involving familiar arcade characters attacking Earth works better than I thought it would; something about Pac-Man eating vehicles provided, for me, some sort of twisted humour. The film has its flaws, and arcade fans may get more out of it than other groups, but for me, it was a blast to watch.",

If the \"critics\" love the movie, I usually skip it because the movie is not very good. This is a perfect example of this. I took my 10 yr old son with me to see it. This movie does exactly what I think movies are supposed to be for. It entertains. It was moderately funny for me, at no time did I have a deep belly laugh, but I did laugh and smile throughout the movie. My 10 yr old though, he loved it, big hearty laughs were plentiful from him. This movie does not have some deep secret meaning of life or supposed to teach you the way of the world. It does exactly what it was meant to do, give a laugh and entertain for an hour and 40 minutes. I thought Josh Gad was pretty good in this as was Kevin James. Sandler and Dinklage were ok as well. I grew up with these old games and it brought back some good memories and actually got my son wanting to find these older games online and play them. He is still playing donkey kong. If you have a free afternoon, take your kid and enjoy a good movie and walk down memory lane. Go see it.",

I am not an Adam Sandler hater, but I am getting sick of the same story that he crafts year after year. The visuals for this movie were great but I was mixed on the characters. Josh Gad was funny from the start but he got old quick. Peter Dinklage was so bad, he was not funny at all, I was expecting him to be really funny but he just became this mess with a terrible accent. Then you have Kevin James and Adam Sandler who are just not believable in their roles. Pixels may be one of the most original stories of the year and I did find it sort of funny at the beginning but the writing for this film is predictable and falls into the same Sandler template. This film is just destined to become a Sunday afternoon cable movie.",

I also feel they could have done better with the transition into action, because I felt they went from 0 to 100 pretty darn fast. One thing as well that really bugged me was the relationship between Violet and Sam, because one minute they hated each other, the next minute they're in love. I personally did not like how they executed their relationship, but if you like relationships like that then its cool. Honestly though the best part comes when the action starts, and boy was it cool! I enjoyed watching the main characters battle it out with some of our favorite classic video game characters, and you really feel the intensity of the situation when VonLichten comes on with their mix of 'We will Rock You.\" so I really enjoyed the climax to the end of the movie. So I feel its definitely worth checking out, but if you're someone who can't handle slow starts to movies, maybe get there later or just wait for it to come out on DVD and fast forward until the good parts.",

      "text": "Pixels is filled with 80's nostalgic aimed for adults but it the film is really mean't for kids and it's a typical Adam Sandler film were he has no charisma it's offensively lazy also he just wants to hang with his friends. The prologue is set in 1982, 13 year-old Sam Brenner (Anthony Ippolito) and his friend Cooper (Jared Riley) ride their bikes to a newly opened arcade, where Brenner comes and shows his skills mastering classic arcade games such as Pac-Man, Centipede, Tetris and Space Invaders. Cut to present day, where Cooper (played by Kevin James who was miss-cast) is a goofy unpopular president of the U.S, Brenner (Adam Sandler) is sad sack who wears a orange uniform and installs TV's and video games. Sam never really gotten over his defeat at Donkey Kong at the hands of showboating Eddie (played by Peter Dinklage) as a grown up, and Brenner can not get over it. Michelle Monaghan plays Violet a soon to be divorced mom, who is a high ranking weapon specialist. Josh Gad is Ludlow, a creepy love able gamer who lives in his mom's basement. Back In 1982, NASA sent a time capsule into space that included arcade games. The aliens misunderstand the videos and that took as a threat and declared war Pac-Man, Galaga, Donkey Kong send them down to Earth to destroy the whole planet. The talented director Chris Columbus (Home Alone 1,2 Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone) has no timing which makes this comedy awkward and not funny, the film does have inspiring action sequences. Sandler's writers Tim Herlihy and Timothy Dowling's script does have laugh out loud moments and pretty cool action scenes but the problems it's their script. Weak female characters and that's not odd because  Sandler has weak sexist characters in his comedies but it's not good. Josh Gad is screechy and thinks it funny if he's high  pitched and screams his lines. You don't buy the chemistry between Michelle Monaghan and Adam Sandler. Kevin James as the president? Wrap your minds around that one. The film can be funny at times but it's a typical lazy zero effort Adam Sandler film, not even the humorous Dinklage in a mullet can save it. Some okay performances and a great visuals. Grade C",

OK that's it for the positives. Even though I laughed at a couple parts it was a pretty big mess from start to finish. The actin was mediocre, the script was bland and the whole idea of using women as trophies when they saved the world. BELCH. I watched this movie because I love old school aracde games and even though Adam sandler does not make good movies nowadays he has had a couple of good ones such as 50 first dates, bedtime stories, billy Madison blended and a few others. However his acting felt very flat and so did the rest of the cast. Predictable with a few entertaining movies does not save this movie from the mess it really is.
