Then in 2013, a bizarre discussion on an episode of Smith's SModcast podcast hastily inspired him to write and direct Tusk, a high-concept movie (in more ways than one, I'm sure) that can be summarized with one sentence: Los Angeles podcaster visits Manitoba and gets kidnapped by a lunatic who turns him into a walrus. Still with me? Smith, during the film's second TIFF screening I attended after its world premiere the night before, joked that he had reached the point in his career where \"I don't give a fu*k anymore\", but just because Smith has reached a bitter crossroads in his career that's resulted in quite literally one of the worst movie experiences I've ever sat through doesn't mean you should also be subjected to the man's lack of impulse control.",

When the inital meeting doesn't turn out as expected, the podcaster finds a letter written by a mysterious adventurer who lives in the middle of nowhere in Canada. From there, the podcaster arrives to the mansion where the mysterious old man adventurer Howard Howe (Michael Parks)  talks about his stories and how he befriends a walrus. The old man is obsessed with everything about walruses. The podcaster drinks tea with the old man and soon realizes that his tea has been posioned.

Not to mention the incredibly apt title of the song, poignantly reflecting a central point of the film.

Without giving anything away, at the point when we see Mr. Parks' finished masterpiece the movie lost steam for me.  I loved it until that point, when it went from being horror to absurdity.
