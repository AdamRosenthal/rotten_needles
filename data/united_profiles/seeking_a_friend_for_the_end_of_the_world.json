Steve Carell is terrific as usual in a very earnest role, and Knightly is a good casting choice.  There are a bunch of great comedians (Rob Cordry, Amy Schumer) that round out the cast effectively - especially during the free-for-all segments.  Finally, a quick note that T.J. Miller steals the show with his role as the host at a TJI Friday's type of restaurant that's still operating amidst the chaos.

The number one thing keeping it from that is it's overall sense of impending doom and Steve Carrell's character's reaction to the coming apocalypse. It's a very emotional film that most people won't appreciate because their expectations will be that it's a comedy. If you can get past that I think there's something to be liked. One complaint I have is with the ending. There was a point in the movie that was so amazing and so cumulative that I begged them in my mind to end it and they didn't. Instead, the movie went on for another 10 minutes and took a different direction. If it had ended earlier, I probably would have been more apt to give it a higher score.",

What may frustrate some is that the film (though consistent throughout) does not reveal its intentions until the last third. It isn't a rom-com. It's a flat out romance. Although there are a lot of really funny comic flourishes, it isn't a comedy. What the screenplay portrays in superbly natural but affecting dialog is the growing intimacy of Dodge (hero) and Penny (heroine) in this horrific situation. Most of this is done in subtext, as the picture depicts the various reactions ordinary human beings have to the impending apocalypse. When the picture finally opens up and reveals that its subject all along has been the relationship of these two, the effect is tremendously moving. The final moments are emotionally satisfying to a degree that few love stories never achieve. I am totally at odds with the critics who found this cliched or trite - what the hell do you expect people to say to each other as the world ends?",

This is a surprisingly sweet movie (an observation from someone who usually doesn't like \"sweet\" movies), and it is precisely the setting of this rather corny but affecting relationship element against the \"dark\" but never-taken-too-seriously background of the \"end of the world\" that makes it so effective. (Apparently some people were expecting \"Dinner with Schmucks\" while others wanted either \"On the Beach\" or  John Paul Sartre.) I don't usually like Steve Carell (too glib) and think that Keira Knightley is somewhat overrated. But here Carell's basic \"sweetness\" (that word again) and decency shine through his deadpan performance, and Knightley proves to be a surprisingly charming comedienne. (Sorry, I didn't see the Pirates of the Carribbean movies.) The script is admittedly uneven, but there are nevertheless some great moments (esp., the lame boyfriend, but also the cop who insists on giving the tickets despite the impending apocalypse and the employer asking the  few remaining employees who wants to be CFO). More importantly, it is the evolving (albeit not entirely believable--though Scott's \"copping a cuddle\" seems misanthropic in the extreme) relationship between the two opposite \"losers in love\" and the fact that, once again, the writer never takes herself too seriously (unlike, for example,  Lans von Trier) that makes the movie both likable and fairly touching.",

However that doesn't mean there isn't great humour, joy and warmth in this wonderfully crafted movie by first time director Lorene Scafaria. Seeking a Friend for the End of the World is the story of Dodge (Steve Carrell), a man living with regret that his life has had no meaning. This regret is magnified by the fact his wife has left him and he has possibly the worst friends ever. Oh and there's the fact the world is going to end in 3 weeks thanks to a giant asteroid. This puts Dodge in a reflective mood and he thinks of his past love and whether he can see her again. Meanwhile free spirited Penny (Keira Knightley) living underneath him is torn up over the fact she missed the last flight to England and will never see her family again. Through various hijinks the two collide and vow to help each other. It's an unusual film in that the premise is so incredibly depressing and upsetting but the result is down to earth, clever and heartwarming. The film handles some serious themes but never lets them overburden the film as a whole. The discussion of mortality in the film is incredibly moving as Dodge wishes he had made the most of his life but always knew he wouldn't live long where as Penny wants to live if only because she doesn't feel fulfilled. The most surprising thing about the film is that it dares to be risque and crude in its comedy while delivering a finished product that will touch even the most cynical of people. The supporting cast is extensive and there is not a weak link in the bunch, which includes Patton Oswalt and William Petersen to name but a few. However the film wouldn't work without its two leads and both Carrell and Knightley give career high performances, especially the latter who tones down her performance to match the characters quiet yet frantic nature. It's a film that will surprise and impress with every twist and encounter right up to its final conclusion which may or may not have you weeping like a baby.",

The films saving grace was its comic relief - some truly hilarious moments managed to shine through the blah.",

However between the fact that the romance was only somewhat believable and the fact that the film seemed to rely on musical interludes as scene transitions there were many flaws. There was certainly a potential that this film did not reach.",

      "text": "Seeking a Friend for the End of the World is a fantastic film. Steve Carell and Keira Knightley are absolutely irresistibly delightful here. The film as a whole is very well put together and a really funny and authentic look at how the world would react to the end of the world: poorly. The characters act as if they are trying to cram their entire life into the time they have, which to me, makes complete sense. I have no idea how else people would respond. However, where the film is truly a resounding success is in the touching elements: romance and reconciliation. Sure, it is anything but original, but is deeply affecting all the same and really hits home. This film handles the blend of doom, romance, and comedy, quite well without becoming too jarring in one direction or the other. Overall, it is not the most challenging film ever made, but is one that plants an infectious smile on your face.",

The chemistry between Carell and Knightley is really special here; they both give great performances and carry the film wonderfully. Under the direction and writing of Lorene Scafaria, this film manages to make you smile and laugh, but it also breaks your heart. The film builds perfectly to a devastating (abrupt) ending, but it's fully satisfying all the while. I cannot recommend this film enough.",

The relationship(s) storyline ring absurdly true to me, for I know alot of people and have never married but dated/had relationships throughout my life.  I thought Steve's dramtic acting was far and above anything he's ever attempted thus far and...he sold me and I'm a definite hard-sell.  He's always been a superior comedic actor, normally stealing the movie(s) away from bigger named stars, but I've got to tell you, in this role as 'Dodge', he stole my heart with his talent in this film.  Keira has always been a superior dramatic actor and this time around completely sold the bubbly, ditzy, free-spirited 'Penny' who hides her heart very well right up to the end and then just allows herself the gift of freely opening herself up to love.  I was sobbing at the end of this 'little funny film', that ended up being placed on my top 15 best films of all time!  You've Gotta see this film for yourself...you'll be telling your friends, family and co-workers all about it at the office water-cooler next week!",

It has elements that look and feel like Garden State, Little Miss Sunshine, and other popular indie films that have premiered over the past ten years. Carell is the best he has been since the above mentioned Little Miss Sunshine, and Knightly is strangely perfect for her role. Don't walk into the film thinking it is going to be a romantic comedy because of the casting choices. This is a romance, an unorthodox romance, but a romance none the less. This film may not gain immediate acclaim, but as time passes it will grow in popularity. If you like romance Seeking a Friend for the End of the World is a must see.",
