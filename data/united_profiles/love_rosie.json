      "text": "Despite a cliched storyline a string of cliches, I actually liked this film pretty much for me I was emotionally involved in this story no matter how weak and formulaic the script is by Juliette Towhidi, and first-time director Christian Ditter's direction is charming also the chemistry between it's two stars Lily Colins (Abduction) and Sam Claflin (Hunger Games: Catching Fire). So let me explain this predictable plot, so Alex (Claflin) and Rosie (Collins) were best friends since they were five years old, Alex tells Rosie his weird twisted dreams. They couldn't be more perfect for one another or could they? You have to be an idiot if you don't know the answer. Love is their worst enemy, so is making good choices they have when their teenagers they have feelings for one another but they won't admit it. At their prom night, Alex and Rosie have a passionate kiss, Rosie is too drunk to remember that kiss, but at the same time she loses her virginity to her classmate Greg (Christian Cooke) resulting in an unexpected pregnancy. Such new coincides with Alex's move to Boston medicine. As Alex and Rosie go in different paths, an inevitably romance is on the rocks. I found the lead characters dumb, the two lead characters have an annoying chemistry with one another, which the results are an unwell made rom-com with amazing production standpoint and appealing chemistry with Lilly Collins and Sam Claflin, but with a better script. But I still enjoyed it and somewhere I have strange connections with it. 3 out of 5 stars",

The plot also lends itself to the beauty of the love story, as does the sparkle of the leads who depict every turn of the story magically and with true conviction. It deals with some serious themes too and will give audiences a rom-com without the cheesy chick-flick style of most modern alternatives",
