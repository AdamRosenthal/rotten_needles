As girl girl sex seems to be the 'in' thing just now I just hoped it wasn't jumping on the bandwagon because of \"Chloe\" and \"Black Swan\". Also sexy films are doing the rounds with two new ones about Linda Lovelace planned for 2013 and \"About Cherry\" is a good example of a sexy film. Ashley Hinshaw certainly doesn't act like a rookie in this and manages to put her fresh faced appeal into the role as she is convincing as a newcomer to the porn industry. Instead of showing the darker side of adult film making Stephen Elliot has given a look at how family and friends are ultimately the ones who pay the price of the decisions that are made. The whole cast were good and I liked the pacing. An OK adult movie.",
