Apparently so - The movie dragged and stalled, the characters often seemed oddly disconnected from the events around them and the moments of fine acting that might otherwise have made true impact were swallowed up in the overall void that seemed to suck the connection and reality out of the rest of the film.  One positive, Dev Patel amazingly seemed to be able to raise his role out of the vacuum enough to create a charming and believable character in spite of the odd vacancy surrounding him.",

Also sexy films are doing the rounds with two new ones about Linda Lovelace planned for 2013 and \"About Cherry\" is a good example of a sexy film. Ashley Hinshaw certainly doesn't act like a rookie in this and manages to put her fresh faced appeal into the role as she is convincing as a newcomer to the porn industry. Instead of showing the darker side of adult film making Stephen Elliot has given a look at how family and friends are ultimately the ones who pay the price of the decisions that are made. The whole cast were good and I liked the pacing. An OK adult movie.",
