In fact it's really intelligent, which will hurt it's reviews.

Certainly debatable if its a date movie, but its a mans movie. I'm sure going in, people were expecting the chick flick. Ya know, where the guy gets the girl, they briefly break-up, and guy does everything to get her back. It wasn't that. It ended differently, and it was fantastic. This is probably the most fun movie I've seen this year. I suggest that if you like good movies, you should put this on your must see list.

Sugarman is a Jewish name, as noted by the parents of Jon Martello (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) when he brings her home and introduces her to his Italian-American family, although in one scene Johansson sports a crucifix around her neck, so that detail was either a mistake or she was supposed to have had a Christian mother and a Jewish father. In any case, the film was directed and written by Gordon-Levitt, who is admittedly showing signs of youthful genius (but not necessarily in this film); however, Gordon-Levitt was born in Los Angeles, and like a lot of Hollywood actors and directors who did not grow up in industrialized northern New Jersey, his concept of a primitive, uncultured working class in New Jersey, especially of Italian origin, is highly exaggerated and misconceived. Yes, Ol' Blue Eyes came from Hoboken, and it is there that you will find the thickest so-called \u201cJoisey\u201d accent, but that is because of Hoboken's proximity to New York City, which is standing right there on the opposite shore of the Hudson. Indeed, that accent originates from the depths of Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island. It affects parts of New Jersey by association only. The erroneous concept that this accent originated in New Jersey goes hand-in-hand with the Hollywood belief that New Jersey is the cultural pits of the planet.",

Il problema  che il giovanotto  un egocentrico impenitente  in ci\u00f2 che ritiene importante c\u2019\u00e8 una sfilza di aggettivi possessivi  e, di conseguenza, nel rapporto con l\u2019altro sesso ha la sensibilit\u00e0 di un quindicenne carico di testosterone: cataloga le donne dando loro un voto,  un seduttore seriale (da cui il nomignolo \u2018Don\u2019), ma la sua vera passione resta il porno, giudicato sempre pi\u00f9 soddisfacente di qualsiasi rapporto reale. Quando incontra Barbara, la sua prospettiva parrebbe cambiare  e vorrei ben vedere, avendo lei le fattezze di Scarlett Johansson  tanto che si azzarda persino a presentarla in casa per la gioia di sua madre che non vede l\u2019ora di diventare nonna. Ben presto, per\u00f2, il meccanismo si inceppa, un po\u2019 perch\u00e9 lui non riesce a rinunciare al sesso virtuale, un po\u2019 perch\u00e9 lei  solo un\u2019altra faccia di un atteggiamento egoista verso la vita: Barbara cerca di plasmare Jon a suo piacimento  la scuola serale, il divieto di fare le pulizie, le pellicole sdolcinate a ripetizione (Anne Hathaway e Cuba Gooding jr. cammei dei film nel film)   finch\u00e8 la sorella di lui Monica non dice che il re  nudo nell\u2019unica battuta che le  riservata, visto che per il resto del tempo  impegnata con il telefonino. Le lezioni forzate hanno per\u00f2 avuto almeno il pregio di far conoscere a Jon la sua compagna di corso Esther, una Julianne Moore che pi\u00f9 lontana non potrebbe essere dai suoi ideali femminili: tra le braccia materne di questa vedova molto pi\u00f9 vecchia di lui  gli fa il bagno e occhio anche al cambio di prospettiva sul preservativo  egli fa infine un passo verso la maturit\u00e0, riuscendo per la prima volta a dare oltre che a ricevere. Per la sua prima regia, Joseph Gordon-Levitt scrive e dirige questa svelta (novanta minuti scarsi) commedia dal buon ritmo e puntellata da un pi\u00f9 che discreto numero di battute: pur essendo un californiano di origine ebrea, la ambienta curiosamente in una famiglia italoamericana cattolica, ma questa sua versione di giovane Scorsese con il sorriso funziona assai meglio di quanto ci si potesse aspettare. Il merito va equamente diviso tra una scrittura che mostra davvero pochi passaggi da limare e un cast che sembra divertirsi: Gordon-Levitt  sempre in scena, anche se all\u2019inizio non aveva pensato a se stesso come interprete, e attorno a lui gli altri attori riescono a caratterizzare con gusto i loro personaggi, compresi quelli minori come i genitori di Jon Tony Danza e Glenne Headly oppure gli amici tamarri come e pi\u00f9 di lui Rob Brown e Jeremy Luke. Certo, tutto questo parlare di (e fare) sesso pu\u00f2 dare fastidio a qualcuno, come  successo anche fra i sei che erano in sala con me durante la proiezione:  un peccato, per\u00f2, perch\u00e9 l\u2019argomento, pur scivoloso,  trattato cercando di evitare la volgarit\u00e0 e viene usato per rappresentare quell\u2019eccesso di autoreferenzialit\u00e0 che caratterizza molti individui nella nostra societ\u00e0. Il tutto, comunque, senza prendersi troppo sul serio e, soprattutto, evitando i moralismi: se da una parte lo sguardo sul piccolo mondo che ruota attorno a Jon poteva essere pi\u00f9 aggressivo, dall\u2019altro il \u2018lieto fine\u2019 conclusivo risulta ben lungi dall\u2019essere classico.",

      "text": "Don Jon turns the rom-com formulae on it's head and it refreshingly feels targeted at men as apposed to women. Joseph Gordon-Levitt has been one of my favourite actors in recent years and I was intrigued to  see Don Jon knowing that it was a project he'd written and directed himself. And I'm pleased to say that Joseph Gordon-Levitt comfortably delivers in every respect. In the last few years his career has quietly built momentum and his recent run of form in front of the camera has been impressive. And this refreshing directorial debut boasts his capabilities behind the camera also. The overall direction moves at a thoroughly enjoyable pace and visually this an attractive and theatrical experience. This film humorously compares and analysis both male and females perspectives of the opposite sex, relationships, morals and habits. And most significantly this film tackles the subject of pornography and how stereotypically men and women feel about it. Whilst there are aspects of this film that are undoubtedly dramatic and theatrical, there are also many moments that are relatable and will hit him for male viewers in particular. Joseph Gordon-Levitt gives a fun and charismatic performance in the leading role. Whilst the equally impressive Scarlett Johansson stars opposite and the chemistry between the pair is refreshingly original and unpredictable. The supporting cast is strong also with humorous performances from Tony Danza & Glenne Headly who play stereotypical father and mother figures respectively. Julianne Moore gives a decent performance also and her character brings the story back down to earth with a much wiser perspective on sex and relationships. First and for most this is an enjoyable and harmless rom-com. But what I love most Don Jon and what sets it aside from other rom-coms, is that ultimately it avoids rom-com cliches at all costs.",

I loved the first hour of the movie it was funny and enjoyable but then it seemed to just get too serious for me and it wasn't what i thought it was going to be. Overall i give it a 7/10 but i do have to say Joseph Gordon-Levitt is a lucky bastard he got both Scarlett Johansson and Julianne Moore",

Gordon-Levitt embodies this unreal, extreme example of the kind of male characters that flood our screens courtesy of Jersey Shore. Johansson's role embodies another extreme but in female form. Crucially though they are both decidedly superficial. The difference between the two is simply that Jonny experiences a sort of peripeteia through the influence of three characters  his sister, best friend and Julianne Moore. There are scenes that are repetitive, but that's the whole point, repeating but changing. It was simple too, but again, it's focus was on a microcosm of society, explored through unrealistic characters, so I don't think that's necessarily a problem. I'd recommend people see it, I enjoyed it but I won't see it again. The cast were good, the script was basic and the focus was different.",

It started out very well and funny with the jokes being fresh and on point. Jon's monotonous lifestyle is somewhat similar to my life, minus the porn and the constant one-night-stands and the weird clothing so I could really relate to the character. However, I was quite disappointed by how not-deep-at-all the characters development is.
