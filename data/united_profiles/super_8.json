This movie starts out promising but then falls apart completely by the end. The main problem with the movie is that the monster has no purpose what-so-ever in the story and the film would have been great if it was just about the father son trying to find peace after the death of the mother in addition to the son coming of age with the girl and his friends by shooting a super 8 movie. That part of the movie is good, then the monster appears and not only destroys half of the town, but it goes one step further and destroys the film too. The monster is just stupid; it's not interesting and there's really nothing in the storyline of the monster that hasn't been done before. It's basically bits and pieces of other - better - movies that have already been released.  The movie falls apart because for almost 3/4 of the film the monster is just background noise between the scene of the boy and girl, and his friends, all of which are interesting.  Then at the end of the film these stories are abandoned completely and the monster's story - which sucks - is wrapped up in to a cgi blastoff which ends the film.",

I enjoyed this movie but in watching it, even though there is a sense of wonder and nostalgia that is generally missing in movies these days, you realize quickly how rare a talent Steven Spielberg is.  Here is what Spielberg did right and some of what is lacking in \"Super 8\".  First, the villain is not flushed out.  In E.T., the villain really isn't a villain except in the eyes of the protagonists.  \"Keys\" as he is known in E.T. believed what he was doing was for the greater good.  He longed for an experience like Elliot.  Unfortunately, he failed to see what the children saw all along, that E.T. was a living being with his own needs and desires.  In \"Super 8\", the villainous Nelec was completely two dimensional and malevolent.  The story would have been stronger had the motives been clear for his behavior and especially if his judgment was complex \u00e2",

J J Abrams really couldn't have made it any clearer that he loves Spielberg, everything from the setting, to the cinematography and mise-en-scene could have come from late 70s/early 80s Spielberg films. Maybe you could criticise Abrams for being too Spielbergian and having few ideas of his own, but he does undoubtedly put his own mark on the film, once again demonstrating his skill as a character-focused storyteller. After the emotional first act and sensationally realised train crash, the plot does drag a little, and evil army officials seem a little too cliched to make particularly compelling antagonists (though using them does nod to E.T.)

The train crash scene alone is just spectacular but the final few scenes are also just amazing. Overall a stand-out film from 2011 and one of my favourites for this genre.",

Abrams being branded on every trailer and poster I simply had to give it a shot. And I was really glad I did because it was very very good. It was really a tribute to the movies of the late 20th century wasn't it? It had all the elements of Spielberg's classic E.T. with a close group of friends on bicycles riding about town shooting scenes for a movie with \"production value\", adults who seem to be one step behind the kids on the whole mystery, the government intervention and of course an extraterrestrial being \"trying to go home\". The special effects were great, especially the train crash. Very breathtaking stuff. But even with all the amazing effects and all the action going around, we never really forget the emotional side of it all, Abrams never let's the action upstage the human aspect of the story. Joe who recently lost his mother to a violent tragedy lives with his grief-stricken, depressed and distant father begins to bond with Alice in an 8mm film production of zombies, she herself has father issues. Their relationship reminds me a bit of Abby and Owen in Let Me In united by their own little tragedies, finding solace in each other. Elle Fanning and Joel Courtney play their roles exceptionally well, amazing since it's their first time in a major movie. It was really refreshing to finally watch a movie which was not rushed through production (yeah I'm looking at you X-Men), very carefully thought out and which really took it's own time to tell the story that it wants to tell. I wasn't born in the 60s or 70s but watching Super 8 made me feel like I was in that period of time of filmmaking, it felt very authentic. The closing credits was awesome.",

I'd probably score the basic story and plot framework a \"7\", but the movie does such an incredible job bringing me back to the late 70's, and the kids are so spot-on perfect in their roles, that it became an easy 8, almost a 9. Most kids in movies are nothing like the kids I knew when I was young, but Abrams (and the casting director) nailed them in Super 8.  Yes, it has that E.T./Goonies irreverent feel to it, but without these kids, the movie falls apart. Kyle Chandler, Ron Eldard, and the other adults are also extremely well-cast.  Chandler - the acting Sheriff - is a tough father still grappling with the loss of his wife (who is also amazing in a brief snippet), and Abrams doesn't soft-shoe his relationship with his son.  Elle Fanning is terrific - a star in the making.  It's only the basic story that is the weak part of the film - and that may sound more damning than I mean it to me.  As soon as I heard ELO's \"Don't Bring Me Down\" (embarrassingly my favorite song for like 3 years of my youth) open the film, I was transported back to that time and place, and it just worked. Don't want to spoil anything further - it's worth seeing. Considering that my midnight show was only half-full, I'm skeptical that it'll have a huge opening weekend. I'm just hoping that some of the Potter/Twilight/Hunger Games kids will turn out for it - though the pre-cellphone, net, ipod days of the late 70s might be tough to relate to.",

Surprisingly, the kids were my favorite part of the movie. They were great, funny, and did a great job with the emotional scenes. My favorites would have to be Joel Courtney and Elle Fanning.

It is so incredibly human that it's scary. Just when you think the film is wrapping up...it teaches you a lesson. I can't recommend it enough! It's something you and those around you can really sink into. Few movies are as memorable as Super 8.",

Certain moments gave me small chills, but mostly just hinted at the more fully realized movie that this could have been. Kyle Chandler is wasted on an underdeveloped father figure. The beautifully-shot final moment involving the locket would have been more resonant if the story / characters had actually built towards it - as in the the father/son actually learn to understand each other and come to terms with the mother's passing. Instead, Chandler's character just says \"I got you!\" at the end, semi-randomly. The only other Abrams vehicle I've seen was Star Trek two summers ago - and that was smart, slick, breezy fun compared to this. I just can't fathom that Spielberg was standing around on set or watching an early cut thinking, \"Oh yeah. This is great. It's all working.\" P.S. - only laugh line: \"I could get back into disco.\"\"",

Yes, Super 8 has elements seen in Spielberg movies and some of what you expect from Abrams.  Surprise!  They collaborated it.  I'm glad that Super 8 advertising showed only \"so much\" because it helped to keep the \"mystery\", that I think drew many people in.  The audience with which I saw Super 8 very clearly liked the movie; so did I. Why?  In some part because of remembrances of movies past; but primarily because the acting was surprisingly (at least for me) much better than expected (I could literally feel the audience sucked in with the boys at Elle Fanning's rehearsal at the train station). there were plenty of unknowns to keep you guessing until they were slowly revealed (not always as expected), there was a warmth and caring for the characters that's not often seen in major action movies, and finally the resolution of the story was satisfying (which is often not the case when you find out it's a dream or the unknown entity or dilemma is a dog that's grown to 100 times its size).   Yes there were elements seen in other movies, but they fit within the genre and have a reason for being there. Often, its not the introduction of something never seen that makes art original, it's the combination of its elements that does so.

      "text": "Just watched the movie in Digital-2D. First of all, I would like to say, I'm a big fan of J.J. Abrams' work having watched \"Alias\", \"Lost\" and \"Fringe\", and watched his directorial movie debut \"Mission Impossible III\" and then the epic \"Star Trek\". \"Star Trek\" is one of the best movies I've seen and it absolutely catered for all movie go-ers, Trekkie or not. When his next film was announced, I was super excited. \"Super 8\" is my most anticipated movie of 2011 with \"Hp 7 Pt 2\" and \"T3:DOTM\" behind. I was going to watch this movie no matter the ratings, then again I knew it couldn't possibly have a low rating. When RT had it above 80%, I knew instantly the movie worked (I was actually really hoping for a good reception). I heard that the movie got its first rotten review after 13 reviews while \"Star Trek\" after a staggering 49 reviews. What's not to like about a mysterious movie that no one knows much about except the \"discovery of something inhuman\". The build up with the epic teaser trailer and then the full length trailer just made the wait all more worth it. Since the trailer was in my opinion brilliant, the movie may not turn out the same. Not the case here. I admit I'm bit of a extraterrestrial fan craving for the \"next big alien movie\" - the last one I watched was *pukes* \"Battle: *pukes some more* LA\". Nevermine that so-called movie. It was utter... disgrace. The plot in \"Super 8\" is indeed all its hyped up to be. Without revealing too much, let's just say it has plenty of references to Steven Spielberg's works most notably \"E.T\" (kids on cycles), \"Jurassic Park\" (roar from the distance) and many more including \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" which I have not much memory of since I watched it when I was a kid. I only remember the alien's skinny neck and arms reaching out and the sound/music of the UFO shattering windows. Oh, and you can thrown in \"War of the Worlds\" too. In others words, J.J. Abrams has written some of Spielberg's most iconic alien flicks into this movie, and made it his own. I'm not saying he tried to bring back those moments, but that is what these scenes will undoubtedly invoke. As for the actors, you got Elle Fanning, Joul Courtney and Kyle Chandler. All three were brilliant thought I did feel Kyle Chandler who plays Jackson Lamb trying too hard with his role. Most surprising and worthy to be pointed out is Elle Fanning - only the second movie I've seen her (first being \"Benjamin Button\") and what a surprise. She did really well, and clearly knew her acting chops for the actual-movie itself and in the little film project they did. I definitely felt the 'loss connection' between Joe and his father, and Alice and her father. There were some genuine emotional moments though they were very little. Kudos to the kid who played the zombie too... I don't know whether to love the ending or not, but I felt a few more revisions to the writing could have made it much more memorable. I will not call it half-baked or average at best, but rather a \"nice conclusive ending\". Unlike \"Cloverfield\" where the monster, still lived and you still were guessing at the end of it. So is this movie worth watching? Well, it's definitely a must-watch, BUT and I have to admit, not the epic quality that is J.J's previous work \"Star Trek\". It still is great and a helluva lot of fun to watch. Very entertaining from start-to-finish. Yet again, this movie caters to all types of movie go-ers, whether you're into sci-fi or not. It does not have the ambiguity/grey areas of \"Cloverfield\", in fact it seems to have looked at \"Cloverfield\" as an 'issue' and resolved it with \"Super 8\". Nicely done. -dfltnm365",

Nonetheless, there are good aspects to the film (hence the 6, no?)! The acting is very good when it comes to the children actors - very convincing and very engaging. Adults - not quite so much, but still decent enough for this kind of film. The cinematography was nice at times, with very nice colours and tones they've used with their lenses. Cinematography as in technique of filming - bad. I am not quite sure how I feel about the film overall. Yes, it's good enough to get a positive review, that is for sure.

      "text": "She believes him, but it's a school day, so \"no T.V.\" the mother warns Elliott, who fakes being sick in order to stay home with the alien. Unbeknownst to Mary, whose husband had just recently bailed on her and their three children for sunny Mexico and another woman, there exists a subconscious reason as to why she forbids her son from watching television. Slowly but surely, she's turning into something else, something other than a mother. Later in \"E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial\", Mary is in the kitchen with her daughter, unpacking the groceries while E.T., whom the mother presumes to be Gertie's imaginary friend, constantly avoids her notice, in spite of the little girl's vociferations. The domestic scene, on one level, is all about comic timing: the alien who wobbles right pass Mary while she's busy putting food away in the refrigerator, but \"Super 8\", with its subordinate homage to George Romero, coaxes out another level, which brings to mind the moment in his 1978 shocker \"Dawn of the Dead\", where the living dead traverse a parking lot as they make their descent upon a shopping mall, because, as one character observes, these non-people harbor memories still of what it meant to be alive. Just like these catatonic consumers who know the words but not the music of being human, Mary can't see E.T. because she's among the living dead(her philandering husband killed the old Mary), and is only going through the motions of being a mother. Suburban life has zombified her, exasperated by sexual displacement and the television(which just happens to be on at the time), the same factors that drains all the life out of socialite Cary Scott in \"All That Heaven Allows\", the 1956 melodrama that stealthily informs the Spielberg film, in which the genre-inspired dialectic is fully intergrated, narrative-wise, and not partitioned off as the film-within-the-film in \"Super 8\". Whereas Mary has a divorce impending, Cary(the names rhyme) is a widow, but both women are clearly one and the same, in regard to their negotiation between being a mother and a sexual being. In the Sirk film, Cary, dressed provocatively in a red dress at a get-together among the affluent, causes one partygoer to comment, \"It's indecent to have two children and look as young as you do,\" while in E.T., Mary, who is acting as hostess to a party for Michael and his buddies, shimmies around in an orange kimono, enticing one of the boys to inch his extended finger toward her extended butt while she tends to the food. The gesture mirrors the one that E.T. uses to heal Elliott's finger, but that's not the sort of healing Mary needs, and certainly, Michael's friend is too young to provide it. For Halloween, Mary wears a cat suit, which would probably cause Cary's son to exclaim, \"Holy cats, mother!\"(his reaction to the red dress) and Cary's daughter to expound: \"When we reach a certain age, sex becomes incongruous.\" In the absence of a man, Mary unconsciously flirts with Michael's friends because she needs to feel desirable again. They're about fifteen years her junior, the same chronological distance that exists between Cary and Kirby, the gardener who could rescue the widow from the zombie circuit of the Connecticut suburbs. A zombie, however, is what Cary's children feel comfortable with, so when they chase Kirby away, they buy their mother a sort of surrogate lover, a television set(\"the world's parade at your FINGERTIPS\"), to keep her company. Conversely, it's the zombies themselves who come for Mary in the form of D.C. men outfitted in astronaut suits, invading the house \"Night of the Living Dead\"-style. Near the man crashing through the window blinds, the moviegoer pays special attention to the train-set moving along the circular track, an object suddenly foregrounded through its life-sized counterpart that the kids use in \"The Case\"(the zombie movie), forcing in the moviegoer a rethink of the way Spielberg portrays the suburbs in \"E.T.\" as the golden wonderland of yesteryear, by its association with the darker \"Super 8\" where an entire subdivision is used as the setting for a war between the government and the alien, in which the whole neighborhood gets pounded good. In the Spielberg film, a government agent tells Elliott, \"I'm glad he met you first,\" because had E.T. met the same fate as Aqua(who makes first contact with the millitary), \"Super 8\" suggests that bedlam would likely have followed. E.T. is good because Elliott is good; his telekinetic powers, at the employ of benevolence, could easily have turned Carrie-like if threatened, as is the case with Aqua, who grows up in government captivity. \"Super 8\" makes us realize that Elliott's friend, likewise, had the potential to kill. As suggested by the period setting of \"The Case\"(Charles has his leading man wear a fedora and trenchcoat), the children reject the notion that they're living in a golden age(ala \"Midnight in Paris\").",

The movie did not necessarily present any new material, but simply old concepts and ideas we've seen implemented in other movies rehashed into this feature. Furthermore, I feel the movie dwelled too much on the \"movie-making\" encapsulated plot of the film which did not necessarily add any deeper meaning or understanding to the movie as a whole. In short, I feel that Super 8 lacked a certain amount of new ideas, direction, and meaning for a movie with such an esteemed score. Personally, I rate this movie a 58/100",

Their was comedy, their was drama, and their was action, its had all three, and it did all three very well. My only compaint about this film is the train crash. No way in hell would a pickup truck cause that much damage to a train. At the speed the train was going it would slice right through the truck like a knife with butter, and the guy driving the pickup truck, he survived? How is that possible at all, even in science fiction/ fantasy, its just not possible. Thats the only reason I gave it a 9 and not a 10.

You don't need Brad Pitt and Natalie Portman... just get yourself some lesser known talent with good acting skill, and surround it with a great story and dialogue. I think the real key to making a great movie intended to thrill is doing as LITTLE explaining as possible. Moviegoers are smart (well, I am), and don't need to have every little detail explained to them. Movies that do this take you totally out of the moment, and often commit cinematic suicide because of it. Super 8 does an excellent job of letting the characters and the story do the explaining, while keeping the hints and revelations at a clever minimum. It keeps the movie exciting and emotionally gripping at the same time.",

I really enjoyed watching the relationship between the kids and how they were tangled into an area 51 cover-up plot. The movie also has a lot of heart, well a lot for an action summer flick. The relationship between the main character and his dad is put to good use. The strenuous effect that the death of the main character's mother has on him and his father make for some complex character development that is greatly welcomed. My only gripe with the film is that it can feel like two movies, the alien and the supernatural events that happen don't quite mesh with the overall plot of the film. This movie did what it was supposed to do and then some, and is absolutely worthy of your time. I give this movie a SUPER 8! (get it?)",

The highlight of the film was probably the train wreck scene which was very chaotic and loud. Throughout the first half of the film, there's this growing tension as weird things are happening around the town and people are going missing. It was cool but I thought it should have been explored a bit more. And that represents the biggest problem with the movie- it's all style and no substance. There's not much of a story. It seems the writer forgot the rules of Dramatic Structure. You're supposed to have falling action in between the climax and resolution. In the movie, you get to the big face off between the protagonist and antagonist and five minutes later, the credits role. The ending is more or less what ruined the movie. It's so abrupt and unsatisfying. And it's not a case of \"It's not the destination but the journey there\". No, the movie builds up a whole bunch of events and mysteries that get you excited to see the conclusion. You want to see how it all worked out. But instead, you get a giant middle finger. Sad.

After seeing films such as Cloverfield and Star Trek, Abrams skills as a producer and Director (respectively) is without a doubt good. In fact, Abrams did an okay job directing super 8, by drawing good performances from the young cast and successfully mimicking the aesthetics of Spielberg's work of the 70's and 80's (like Jaws and E.T. just to name a few). But unlike Spielberg's work he failed to tell a good story, which leads to the downfall of this well produced film, Its Screenplay. It was underwritten, causing viewers to witness a half-baked plot being unfolded and care little about our characters by the end of it all. It eventually lead to a climatic mess, which is unfortunate, as it was really working with a good cast and a good premise. Despite these artistic misshaps it was an entertaining, well-meaning summer flick with sweeping visual effect and well constructed action pieces. Despite my disappointment, It would be wrong to give this anything less than 5 because it wasn't bad... It was an okay movie.",

The influence of Spielberg makes Super 8 both suspenseful and a spectacle, but it lacks the convoluted plot twists and character driven drama Abrams is known for. Super 8 is like a 21st Century 'Goonies' meets-a-more-scary 'E.T.'.

Loved the dialogue, funny and witty and the fact that the fat guy actually was portrayed as a real person with real feelings and intelligence. Great that we don't get to see the alien until late in the movie. First I was afraid it was just a huge spider, but thankfully it turned out to be a little more elaborate than that.

      "text": "Super 8, at its core and on paper, sounds like a tremendous idea. You have steven spielberg, a fabulous director directing a movie about a monster that comes and terrorizes the city, sounds good enough, right? Well, not exactly. The way the movie is put together is utterly disappointing, and the ending is wrapped up quickly without tying up any loose ends. The movie is about a boy and his friends shooting a movie with their super 8 camera for a movie festival. They are making a zombie movie, and one night get a girl in the grade above them to drive them out to a train depot to shoot. While filming, a train is coming by and the boys would love to use it for good background and effects. They accidentally capture the train being sabotaged by a driver and the train exploding, as well as the monster escaping. He is a monster from outer space that was being imprisoned and tortured for years. The movie is mostly about the relationship that grows between the main boy and girl characters, with the monster just \"being there\" in the background. That is where Super 8 falls, the monster isn't really the main story, he's just there to spice things up while the other parts of the movie go along. The movie could have just about the relationship with the boy and his father as well as the boy and the girl, and it could have been a movie just about a slice of life. But the monster ruins the movie by constant interruptions and just plain stupidity. The children are captured by military officials, and eventually that is what leads them to the monster. They find out the monsters story which is that he just wants to go home, which is both stupid and has been done before, and the boy just tells the monster to go home, and he leaves, and that is how they wrap the movie up. It is a very disappointing, and doesn't tie anything up.",

Abrams being branded on every trailer and poster I simply had to give it a shot. And I was really glad I did because it was very very good. It was really a tribute to the movies of the late 20th century wasn't it? It had all the elements of Spielberg's classic E.T. with a close group of friends on bicycles riding about town shooting scenes for a movie with \"production value\", adults who seem to be one step behind the kids on the whole mystery, the government intervention and of course an extraterrestrial being \"trying to go home\". The special effects were great, especially the train crash. Very breathtaking stuff. But even with all the amazing effects and all the action going around, we never really forget the emotional side of it all, Abrams never let's the action upstage the human aspect of the story. Joe who recently lost his mother to a violent tragedy lives with his grief-stricken, depressed and distant father begins to bond with Alice in an 8mm film production of zombies, she herself has father issues. Their relationship reminds me a bit of Abby and Owen in Let Me In united by their own little tragedies, finding solace in each other. Elle Fanning and Joel Courtney play their roles exceptionally well, amazing since it's their first time in a major movie. It was really refreshing to finally watch a movie which was not rushed through production (yeah I'm looking at you X-Men), very carefully thought out and which really took it's own time to tell the story that it wants to tell. I wasn't born in the 60s or 70s but watching Super 8 made me feel like I was in that period of time of filmmaking, it felt very authentic. The closing credits was awesome.",

      "text": "This was an entertaining film, thanks to the child stars who carried the whole film like pro's, although the grown-up actors were also quite good. Steven Spielberg produced it but did not direct, even though he might as well have, because the film is thoroughly Spielbergian. Instead of ET, Phone Home, we have ET, Please Leave, because this is not a cute, cuddly creature that any child would want to adopt as a pet and hide in his closet. This ET is fed up with the human species, having been captured after crashing his spaceship, imprisoned for many years, scientifically observed and misunderstood, and once loose, he is dangerous. The original ET was released in 1982, and this movie is set in 1979. The time frame is also very Spielbergian--a simpler time when there was no Internet, no Game Boys, and no cell phones. The only electronic device is a strange gadget called a Walkman. Kids had to be more resourceful and have real hobbies, like making amateur films and carefully painting model cars or model monsters. There is also the Spielbergian empathy for the little boy, wistfully played by Joel Courtney, who must grow up without his mother, marked for life by his grief but also experiencing life more intensely and with more courage, thus giving him a maturity and a wisdom beyond his years. There are lots of special effects, including a train wreck that, spectacular as it was, might have been a little unrealistic, since I suspect hitting a pick-up truck at such high speed should not have caused the devastating explosions and derailment of dozens of cars as depicted in the film. Sometimes the special effects are overdone and try to become a thing-in-itself. In any case, it's nice to see Spielberg back in his old form, even if he hired J.J. Abrams to direct it for him.",

This has a beautiful soul compared to all the other schmaltzy style films. I love it how they blended together the effect of the destruction and the simplicity of characters surviving together as one. I could perhaps suggest that the film is perhaps symbolism, not just for the destruction and isolation of different households of people in society, but also how they are constructed. The only criticism of the film though, is the spirit that Spielberg put a little too whole-heartedly into it. Still deserves to be top though - the effects were beautiful, and I found it a little chilling despite its rating.",

      "text": "Besides the fact that this might be one of Abrams' weaker films, \"Super 8\" is a highly entertaining sci-fi adventure. One of its biggest strengths is what it chooses to focus on. Instead of focusing on the alien itself or the massive destruction the creature causes, Abrams chooses to center in on his main characters; a rag tag group of film making teens who get caught up in their town's hysteria. It's in these characters where \"Super 8\" stands above most alien invasion movies. And while the action isn't the main focus, it certainly is impressive. The train sequence at the beginning is an amazing special effects achievement, and it's definitely one of the most exhilarating sequences so far this year. For those of you who don't know, this movie was made as a way of honoring the work of Steven Spielberg. It feels like a Spielberg movie from the alien invading plot to the way it focuses on the kids' experiences in frightful times. It's kind of a mix between E.T. and Jurassic Park. Unfortunately, \"Super 8\" isn't nearly as strong as those films, but it's satisfying nonetheless. The flaws are mostly minor as the movie shifts its tone a few too many times, and the ending doesn't fit with the rest of the movie. There's also moments where the movie feels a little too familiar. We have the father and son who are dealing with the grief of a dead wife/mother in a conflicting way, as well as the secret government army intent on keeping a lid over the whole situation. Abrams just isn't quite able to make it feel fresh enough to surprise us. But overall, if you're wanting to see a movie that's worth the 8 dollar ticket stub, this is definitely the way to go.",

In fact, most of the cast never had a major role in anything, like the lead, Joel Courtney. I don't know how they found this kid. He had zero professional experience and he was really fantastic.

In that regard, the special effects were great and really cool to take in.

      "text": "\"Super 8\" is a 2011 film directed by J.J. Abrams and starring Joel Courtney and Elle Fanning. The film follows the story of a group of kids who witness a train crash in the summer of 1979 and investigate the paranormal events of the that it has on this town. Well to be blatantly and frankly honest - I observed almost no problems in this movie whatsoever. The problems that I did observe are so trivial and insignificant that I'm not even going to waste my energy going over them. When I saw previews for this film, I saw that the prominent characters in it were mostly middle schoolers. Now, movies like this can go either one of two ways for me. One - the kids in this movie are so obnoxious as crap I don't even want to watch anymore. Two - the kids in this movie are portrayed in an enjoyable and original manner, that I can find myself relating to wholeheartedly. As you may have guessed the kids in \"Super 8\" are portrayed in the latter form. I found every child in this movie to be either hilarious or almost hauntingly familiar. In doing this, Abrams excels at portraying all of the interesting feelings and thoughts that go along with being a kid. The set pieces in this film are unbelievably breathtaking. I mean, the train crash in this movie is so astonishing, words can't even do it justice. The soundtrack by Michael Giacchino is incredibly diverse in emotions - it's scary, breathtaking, and thrilling all at once. The film in and of itself is a rollercoaster of emotions too. There were parts in this film where I couldn't stop laughing. Then there were parts where tension drew out like a blade. There were scenes that pulled at my heartstrings. I honestly can't say that for many of the films that have come out this year. All in all, I felt that \"Super 8\" was an almost relentlessly entertaining thrill ride. I can now see why Steven Spielberg wanted to be attached to this superbly thought out project.",

As the director\u2019s commentary notes, the actual filming was done mostly with 35mm stock and the RED camera system (for later retakes, pick-ups, inserts) but also utilized Super-8 film, of course\u2026 the actual movie within the movie the kids are shooting is created on the genuine film stock Kodak put out in box-like cartridges (yes, you can still buy them).  It all looks seamless, and the Blu-ray maintains an accurate visual quality with deep blacks that  leave in the shadowy details some transfers might otherwise crush into dark mud, consistent grain balance, excellent reproduction of flesh tones (as they were in the theatrical release) and deep color reproduction with no bleeds.  Overall it is a great transfer, perhaps the best of 2011 (not counting re-issues/restorations).  It offers a tight and crisp picture along with a downright impressive level of sharp detail and no noticeable edge enhancement or apparent DNR (the only image softness I saw was what Larry Fong intended and captured as he switched apertures due to set lighting issues or blew out the background when changing focal lengths).  Of course, like most top-notch Blu-ray releases these days it\u2019s hard to tell how good the quality may actually be as there is so much post-production digital tinkering going on in contemporary movies before they hit the theater screen, but when compared to the the DVD disc (Disc 2 of the 2-disc package that also includes the now ubiquitous digital transfer for iTunes/Windows Media Player) and you can immediately see the difference in the level of detail, color saturation, and black levels.",

It's got all the emotion and heart in all the right places and is a family drama at it's core, but it also offsets any chance of that kind of cheesiness in the most incredible way - through sheer insanity. Seriously, it almost seems like a spoof of itself thanks to a completely zany plot and mad visuals a-plenty. I sure love how the steven-esque emotional through-lines and style help you engage, but it's the quirky vision that makes it something special.",

It's also a love letter to all those with a passion for filmmaking that emerges at a young age. Super 8 is the kind of high-profile movie we so rarely see these days: an original story (not a sequel, spin-off, re-boot, or adaptation) in 2-D. The special effects are state-of-the-art (would anyone expect anything different from an Abrams/Spielberg collaboration?) but are not used gratuitously. Unlike many science fiction features, this one puts the characters before the monsters and the big bangs. Abrams remembers the simple rule that a majority of his contemporaries have forgotten: action and mayhem have meaning only when an audience cares about the people trapped within the maelstrom.",
