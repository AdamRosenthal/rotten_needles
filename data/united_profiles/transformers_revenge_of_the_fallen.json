You can complain all you want about the racist robots, the lame dialogue, the annoying human characters, and overstuffed action sequences, but it all comes down to one central problem.

      "text": "Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is for the most part is what I would have expected from a big budget movie about giant robots beating the sh** out of each other while causing maximum carnage to civilisation. The design of the transformers and the transformations from robot to vehicle mode and vice versa are visually stunning and most of them (especially Optimus Prime and Megatron) are nicely voiced. Megatron is a still a bad ass! Optimus Primes personally is portrayed very well: He's wise and a natual leader. This movie has got pretty much everything an action movie needs: explosions, brawls between the transformers and giant monuments (like pyramids and buildings) and objects blowing up and tumbling down to Earth with a thud. In short this movie is massive in scope with loads of actions scenes. Because this is a movie with a load of fast paced action scenes, this is a movie that needs to be enjoyed on a big cinema style TV with good speakers. The plot is a little bit of a mess: the movie revolves around Sam Whitwicky and he has some information about an energon source hidden on Earth and the nasty transformers (the Deceptions) want to get their hands on him so they can locate it. It follows on from the first Transformers movie and all of the Autobots have taken refuge on Earth searching for what's left of their Deception foes. The biggest trouble with this movie is that there's too much humour in this movie. The transformers, the Twins are pretty much there for the hysterical factor and I don't give a damn about them. They are annoying and clumsy and besides one scene in the movie, don't really help at all. The unnecessarily unfunny scene where Wheelie (a transformer that transforms into a remote control truck) dry humps Mikaela was just wrong. The character Leo was pointless to the storyline. The story at first may seem serious and tense (especially towards the middle of the movie where the Fallen lands on Earth) but the humour dampens the plot. Starscream (the Decepticon, 2nd in command after Megatron) acts like a coward and has a really weird voice; I mean, what happened to his robotic voice from the first movie. It sounded awesome! I guess his voice does fit his character a little bit because he doesn't seem to get involved in too many battles. He watches from the side lines while Megatron and the Fallen do all the heavy stuff (fighting). He's a little bit of a coward basically. Devestator which looks so bad ass and looks like he could level an entire city due to his massive size is only on screen for 30 seconds! I wished he just eat the Twins, spit them out and then play football with them. The Fallen (the main baddie) may seem dangerous looking at him with his skeleton like appearance, spikes protruding out of his body, his ability to teleport and his huge staff but he gets his ass kicked by Optimus Prime at the end in about 40 seconds; so much for an epic finale. I also love Optimus Prime's manners: He's weak and defenceless and can't get up to fight and the injured Jetfire (who is a old cronk by the way) offers him his parts. He sacrifices his parts to Optimus and Optimus now has the strength to fight the Fallen. Optimus doesn't say thank you to Jetfire. He acknowledges Sam for resurrecting him but doesn't thank a old deception (Jetfire) for sacrificing himself to save him. How selfish! On the outside, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen may seem a fun action movie, I couldn't take it too seriously due to unnecessarily humour and pointless characters. It's watchable but I prefer the first Transformers.",

Clocking in at two and a half hours, this is a drag and then some, with an uneven and completely exhausting plot that twists and turns into senseless action, it becomes quite difficult to follow and, well, unnecessary. To many devices, turning points and pointless additions make up this bloated sequel, where we find Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) now heading to college, but being dragged back into the fight of the Transformers. The Decepticons, or the bad guys, have found a new energy source, and it's location lies within the mind of Sam, and that's really the plot that drags out for an obscenely long time, and the humour and mediocre storytelling, it goes one way by the Decepticons reveal themselves the world and how they will no longer hide, but yet their epic showdown happens in the desert, away from the.. erm.. public eye. These ongoing problems persist throughout the film, as the script seems to contradict itself at many turns, switching locations and using cut-off scenes at what are perceived to be  pivotal moments such as the resurrection of Megatron, but lets cut to Sam's parents trying out snails in Paris. The inconsistencies simply don't diminish, whether its these symbols that are the driving point of the film, why exactly where these missing from the first film, with only subtle hints that never amounted to anything. The humour can be the saving grace of the film, but low and behold we have teo particularly stereotyped Autobots who are now part of of Optimus Prime's  team of earth dwellers who are reminiscent of the gang culture persona of African-Americans, racist and desperate are words that spring to mind. We also have new lady autobots who I'm sure have around five words to say in the entire film, its been made big, but just too big to point where there are mistakes and forgetfulness.",

I didn't read the comics or watch the TV shows so if there's anything in them can gives reason for this I wouldn't know but I don't care. Good movies should be able to stand alone and I have a hard time understanding how transformers can replicate, not just the look of a human, but also the texture of skin, personality, smell, etc. That was just a short segment of the movie so I can't count it against it too much but it still bugged me. Also, why are there way more Decepticons than Autobots and why are the Decepticons always cool things like fighter jets while the Autobots are relegated to various Chevrolet cars and a semi? These things didn't hurt the movie at all it just seems unfair to me.

Bay seems to have it in his mind that the louder and more fast-cutting the action is, the more fun it is to watch, which is false. Although there were a few pretty good visual effects-heavy scenes, Bay rarely keeps the camera on one thing for a split-second and for the whole last hour of the film, which is just a brainless, noisy action sequence, I couldn't tell what was going on. My eyes were just looking at a screen with a lot of seizure-inducing lights on it. Which brings me to plot. It's not that ROTF is a mindless movie, it isn't quite that. Bay does have a story in his mind; however, bad dialogue and poor filming make the story pretty much incomprehensible. Fans of the Transformers might have a good time - I will also say that I did enjoy the first 30 minutes' character-driven humor and a few of the film's twists - but Transformers: ROTF is a huge backstep from the first film.",

Formerly enjoyable characters are now just one-dimensional caricatures who are there to kill time before the next robot fight. The movie spends no time on developing its characters yet expects us to care when they face imminent danger. This highlights another problem. The story and characters are so weak that it detracts from our interest, meaning that scenes of dramatic importance fall flat because we no longer care.

      "text": "I remember reading all of the critics' bad reviews and hearing all of the bad comments from friends when this movie came out a couple of years ago, so between that and the fact that I was no huge fan of the first \"Transformers\" anyway, I made little to no attempt to see \"Revenge of the Fallen.\" However, it was on HBO the other night, and I said, \"what the heck,\" and decided to give it a shot. After two or two and a half LONG hours, it was over, and my thought was \"Well, it wasn't good, but it wasn't THAT bad!\" If there is one thing that Michael Bay can do consistently well, it's that he can make the pictures that make up the film \"pop.\" The actors looked fantastic (especially Josh Duhamel, Tyrese and Megan Fox, who either could be or are models anyway), the locations were gorgeous (especially the Egyptian scenes), and the Transformers themselves beautifully constructed - shiny and colorful, just like they should be. The problem, then, is that Bay has a horrendous eye for cinematography and editing. For some reason, he thinks it is a good idea to film scenes of dialogue and actual emotion on characters' faces from far away, and then film action scenes from so close-up that it is hard to tell who is where at what time in the given action sequence. I swear, at least half of the close shots were ones I thought would have made more sense to film from far away, and at least half of the long shots were ones I thought would have made more sense to film close-in. When you add those factors to editing that can practically induce seizures, the film is just exhausting to try to keep up with. And the dialogue, good god the dialogue is terrible. I know this was a summer action movie, so I didn't have high expectations for the dialogue anyway, but I expect better than this. Almost every line was like something you would find as a bumper sticker slogan or on a Hallmark card. Many of the older, more experienced supporting actors/actresses actually made some of these crap lines work, like John Turturro and the man and woman who played Mr./Mrs. Witwicky, but the younger ones like Duhamel, Tyrese and Fox didn't stand a chance (they are pretty bland actors to begin with). However, the title for worst actor has to go to Shia LeBeouf as Sam Witwicky. His idea of acting in this movie seemed more like a portrayal of a meth addict than of a smart teenage boy starting his first year of college. I just don't understand the love over this kid; he has played that same hyperactive type in every film I have seen him in, and I don't find it cute. I just want to smack him. On top of the bad dialogue and mediocre acting are some very nasty, negative themes. In Bay movies, hundreds of thousands of people die and hundreds of thousands of acres of land are destroyed, but it is all done in the name of entertainment, so hey, who cares? There is no attempt at making the deaths or destruction mean anything, and, in that sense, it cheapens the entire experience. Also, young women are not seen as real people in Bay's movies, but as objects to fulfill men's desires. It is really pathetic how misogyny just runs rampant throughout this film...and these female actors just go along with it, playing the pretty, shallow idiots just like they are told. And don't even get me started on the \"black\" robots, who just so happen to also be the characters who can't read. I think my mouth fell open and I gasped when they said they are illiterate - are audiences really O.K. with that? Because I'm not. The one factor that allows me to move my rating out of the red and into the yellow is the story, which is pretty neat in concept. Unfortunately, that concept is not carried out very well by Bay, but the major storyboard points are interesting enough and make sense in the context of the Transformers' universe. Obviously, based on my review, you can tell I think this movie is very flawed and mediocre. However, in hindsight, I am kind of shocked at how bad those reviews/comments were that I mentioned before. I was expecting to really despise \"Revenge of the Fallen,\" and there are definitely many aspects of the movie that I do despise, but I would watch this again before I watched \"The Last Airbender\" or that god awful \"Twilight - Eclipse\" any day of the week.",

While the story didn't wow me in the first robot romp, the stunning visuals and quirky human characters had me entertained the entirety of the first films duration. I really wanted to like Revenge of the Fallen and I went into the movie with an open mind (as well as the knowledge that it had a pretty crummy reputation with the critics). The movie started out well enough and i remembered thinking to myself; \"What are these critics talking about, this is a decent action flick?\" Then the atrocious humor started to kick in. The humor started out innocent enough and i chuckled at a few crude jokes, but as the film continued the multitude of terrible jokes became relentless. Once the third act of the movie started I thought that the final battle would kick in and the action would cancel out the crude jokes. Much to my dismay not even the final battle was safe from the \"humor\" (a scene involving large transformer testicles comes to mind). It didn't help that the final battle was a little on the boring side. All in all Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen was a disappointment, it wasn't the worst film by any means, it was just all over the place not knowing when to take itself seriously. Overall I did have fun with it there was still plenty of spectacular action sequences to gawk at (most notably the forrest battle) and a plethora of nifty explosions, courtesy of Michael Bay himself. The movie just needed some more focus and it would have been more of a solid installment in the Transformers saga, but there's no going back now.

I saw it in theaters when it came out and hated it, then my friends wanted to watch it again on On Demand so I just went with it and hated it again. I will not watch this crap again and i don't think you should either. One reason for my hatred toward this movie is the plotline is useless and doesn't make sense. Just read a summary of the movie and you know what I mean. It's not just that though, it's also confusing, and not in a cool Inception or Donnie Darko way. It's more of a confusion that you have no idea whats going on but don't feel like figuring it out anyway. Like theres all of these explosions and the camera is spinning everywhere and then Optimus Prime dies but he actually doesn't, or does Sam save him, you know what I don't know and I don't care, all I know is Michael bay sucks at everything and to read up on how much he sucks read my other bogs on this websites. Then right when you think the criticism is over I have one more thing to share with you. The movie had soooo many useless and dull characters that it was funny. this movie could be a comedy, except the jokes in it where they were supposed to be funny are the exact opposite. So it could be a comedy for the wrong reasons and that is not good in my book. So in all, do not see this movie it is a ginormous waste of time.",

I watched this around the time it was available on Netflix, I watched it several times because it looked cool and I liked the music. Watching it now I realize that this is actually a horrible film, with sexist, and racist characters. I know for one that racism is a big deal and that now a days it's a popular form of comedy. A lot of T.V shows do this, shows like South park and Family guy do it all the time, but South park gets away with it because it gives social commentary about what's going on. This film however only gives us fascinating visuals and robots made out of cardboard. That's the major problem a lot of people had with the film, some actually don't care and just roll with it, and that doesn't mean that they're racist or anything. I guess that and some bad directing is what most skepticts focus on, and praising the visuals like everyone does, and who can help it; like what Michael Bay would want people to say after seeing one of his films: this looks awesome. The one thing I enjoy in this film is probably what a lot of people enjoyed as well: the scene where Devastator forms. This is the pinnacle of the special effects, and it's great to see one of the most profitable Transformer toys back in the day have testicles. I don't think I can say much more about this crap that no one else has already said, so I leave saying this: I don't like this movie.",

Specifically, Megan Fox.  She's hot, but she has no acting talent.  The humor is hardly chuckle-worthy at its best, and borderline offensive in its worst, often resorting to stereotypes to try and get laughs.  The climax is wholly unsatisfying, with a complete Deus Ex Machina resurrection of TWO main characters, and a final fight that lasts less than two minutes.  Not to mention Sam Witwicky often serves no other purpose than to run and scream for someone to save him.  If I had to give some positives, it would be Peter Cullen as Optimus Prime, and the impressive quality of the CGI.  Other than that, this is a truly terrible film with very few redeeming values.",

So, so, wrong. Admittedly, the first half of the movie is bad, but it was bearable. We got a few action sequences that were cool to watch. But everything goes downhill real fast after Optimus Prime dies. From there on out, its straight up boring, and the finale is very disappointing. Tons of boring dialogue and filler. You just end up not caring and just want the movie to end. Now of course, I have to give props where props are deserved. The visual effects were cool, CGI was still amazing and everything looked real. But, Michael Bay went all out with his Bay-isms. Racism, hot actresses and extras that he is probably trying to pork, and of course, tons and tons of explosions. In the last movie, there weren't too many and they fit into the movie perfectly. In this one, he went overboard with all the explosions. No matter what happened, there was an explosion. Pencil falls, EXPLOSION! Someone falls down, EXPLOSION! This movie also had an incredibly long run time. This movie is boring and it sucks.",

Transformers Revenge of the Fallen is the worst movie ever made, it's loud, noisy, retarded and tries to be The Dark Knight of Transformers movies and fails. Fight scenes are hard to understand and the humor is WAAAAAY more offensive than any movie you have seen. And the finale was underwhelming, especially for a Michael Bay film. If you plan on watching this monstrosity, do yourself a favor and just watch Pacific Rim or the first Transformers movie.",

The humor in this is just so terrible, with it being mostly racist and stupid, just like every other Michael bay movie.
