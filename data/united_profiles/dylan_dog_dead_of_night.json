When a wealthy collector is slain by a mysterious creature of the night, Dylan is hired to track down his killer and locate a stolen artifact with the power to bring about the end of the world! Kevin Munroe makes an ambitious attempt to bring the classic comic character to life in the self-titled film, and while the film falls short on many levels, Munroe does manage to deliver a fun, action-packed hour-and-a-half that remains true to the spirit of the character. The script retains much of the same great humor from the comics, with plenty of quick quips and wicked puns to entertain the masses. The body shop--where zombies go to buy replacement parts--is one of many hilarious additions. Dylan is played by SUPERMAN RETURNS star Brandon Routh, who feels slightly displaced in the role. He misses out on many great opportunities because of his dry, listless performance, but there are several moments where he finally clicks with the character. Routh is joined by DETROIT ROCK CITY's Sam Huntington as Dylan's silly sidekick Marcus, who is just learning to live with his deathly disposition. Unlike Routh, Huntington takes the role way too far over the top. The creatures and costumes are all very good, with everything from vampires, to werewolves, to mounds of the undead that are all waiting to keep Dylan occupied. Dylan also appears in his trademark red shirt and black jacket to battle evil the old-fashioned way. DYLAN DOG: DEAD OF NIGHT is an inspired blend of film noir, action, comedy, and horror that Buffy fans are sure to enjoy!",
