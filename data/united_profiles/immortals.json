The acting is poor, the plot is thin, dull and poorly executed and the script is the worst I have ever encountered in a profesional film. Even the films one the redeeming feature - the action - is often flat and dull. There are only two good things in this film.  The first is the action scenes involving the gods which are exciting, dramatic, fast moving and satisfyingly gory but far far too brief. The second is the performance of Mickey Rourke as the evil king Hyperion who is easily the best actor in the whole debacle. The main con is the acting ability of all the other actors which makes a plank of wood look like Laurence Olivier. Theseus is played by the typical good looking guy who clearly feels that muscles are a fitting substitute for performance and John Hurt, who is a generally a very good actor, is woefully misused. It is difficult to point out a single actor who acted in any way which didn't seem forced and unreal. However, this may not be their fault as the characters are given the depth of a thimble of water by the script and I imagine it must be hard to work well with a script that is so badly written that it would embarrass a ten year old. Several times, throughout some of the \"profound\" speeches the characters gave I actually got goosebumps, not because it was such a poweful use of the English language but, because it was so cheesy that it made my skin crawl. This similarly applies to the sex scene which was so completely random and seemed shoe-horned into the film just because every film should have romance. This brings me to the plot which was so predictable that you didn't need to be Nostradamus to stay 3 steps ahead of it. It really does seem like like the creator picked up \"Ancient Greece for Pre-School\" at a book sale, scavenged some names from it and mushed them all together rather than having any clue about what they are famous for (Eg: Since when was Theseus a bastard? and wasn't Hyperion actually a Titan himself?) but lets just skip over my gripes as to how the film was unrelated to Greek mythology in almost every way as to most readers that will be rather boring. The final nail in the coffin was that the battle scenes, with the exception of those previously mentioned, seemed rather unoriginal, flat, and, dare I say it, boring. Never have I been less interested in the clash of two great armies. Similarly the pre battles speeches had none of the badass attitude or brevity of \"Tonight We Dine In Hell\" and none of the epic grandeur of the speeches in Lord Of The Rings', instead they just sort of fizzled out in banal nonsense. If I, sat safely in my cinema seat, thought that the supposedly rousing speech was terrible and that the person giving it had the charisma of plague victim then how can we be honestly expected to believe that it could inspire men to charge into almost certain death? Quite simply this film was terrible and I would honestly encourage you not to waste your money and if you really must watch it then buy it cheaply from a bargain bin.",

The movie  is just big amount of money putted in effects and fights and i they are not even putted in something new and creative they copy almost everything from \"300\" it's not a big deal but at least do it right they even fail in imitation off  the scenes.There is no creativity no new ideas they say \"Hey i saw that in movie lets put it in our movie and see whats happen\" but that's not the way. You will loss\u0435 interest in the movie with every minute you watch.The main character  as usual is a guy full with cheats like \"Infinity ammo\" \"Flash\" \"Extremely big stamina\" . The movie is disappointment for me and it's a waste of time they use a good trailer to attract viewers who will watch a movie full with lame ideas and poor plot that's my opinion .",

The characters have absolutely no depth and lack chemistry; Henry Cavill is just required to look heroic and handsome because his character is pretty much the same as Sam Worthington's Perseus from Clash of the Titans. Titans may have been a bad film but at the least the plot was coherent enough unlike Immortals where the filmakers decide that they (needlessly) have to have Poseidon send a giant wave in to help the heroes fend off about 6 soldiers when Theseus himself killed at least that single handedly earlier in the film.

The acting was mediocre, the characters were all very one dimensional (I didn't care for any of the characters) and poorly developed characters like the monk (yes he is literally just called \"the monk\") serve quite literally no purpose in this film.  Even the action, the true focus of the film wasn't up to scratch.  Apart from the battle with the gods (which looked awesome, but wasn't enough of it), none of the battles caught my eye.

      "text": "A rather mundane way to waste a couple of hours. This film reeks of average content, average scripting and (mostly) average acting. That's not to say it's bad, it's not not good in any real way. Certainly the action scenes (which we all are watching it for, lets face it) can be quite good, but those that are are unfulfilling in their length. A great deal has been said about Immortals comparison to 300, well of that film it falls far short, but the lineage of this bastard son is notable in the attempt at the slow motion visceral combat scenes. Yet somehow director Singh has managed to take all the slickness and clarity out of these scenes. In the predictable final battle, after a rather lacklustre pep-talk by main character Theseus, the melee is so confusion and the colours so drab that its very difficult to see exactly what is going on and whose doing what. Not that you'd care much; the characters of this film are all pretty mundane and without intrigue, popping off a couple of cliched lines occasionally and then dying appropriately as the drama demands. You have Theseus, the main protagonist who has a rather worrying relationship with his mother and that's about all there is to distinguish him. He blathers a bit about faith and the lack of faith (a running theme), but it's so irrelevant to the overall plot you can pretty much disregard it. There's Phaedra, the virgin oracle who doesn't remain so very long (here the film is similar to 300 in its gratuitous and pointless sex scene, although not as funny as 300). Then there's, for me, the one true highlight of the film, the \"evil\" king Hyperion, played by Mickey Rourke. Rourke is by far the strongest character of the film and I actually found myself rooting for him more and more; he had a game plan, set morals and didn't seem like a piece of wet tissue paper like a lot of the other characters. I genuinely hoped he would win in the end (he didn't, this is Hollywood after all). Another stronger point is the battle sequences of the gods, which are fast and viceral, though too short to be really satisfying. Watching what one of them splatter bad guy head with a hammer in slow motion was pretty fun. But tragically that's about it, the greek gods, who are dressed in bizarre garish gold costumes something akin to a French perfum advert, are pretty anonymous - the only way to tell Poseidon appart from Zeus is that he's holding a trident. I'm sore pressed to say who the other two gods were, possibly Apollo? Maybe Helios? Perhaps Whocares, god of weak character development? Athena, who is actually named, seems a bit of bimbo and quite pathetic, rather than the strong willed, stubborn goddess of wisdom and war she's meant to be. But, like all other characters in this film, even the gods are just there as padding until their dramatic deaths (I did tick the \"spoiler\" box). Of course only a Titan (whom Hyperion is attempting to free to bring about a new world order or something....) can do it. I bet they're massive! I hear you cry. Well no, they're not titanic, ahem, they're more like the savages from the Decent and plastered in grey mud, then they die like Hollywood vampires by crumbling into dust, much like my interest at this point. All that isn't bad, it's just not good, it's weak but its palatable. It's average but its not terrible. What's really bad about the film is little irritating stupidities that make no sense whatsoever. It might just be me, but Phaedra drinking from pool of water in the least efficient way possible (holding her hand vertically so that no water is actually retained) and then dribbling water from her own lips into Theseus' was just ridiculous. The misuse of actors like John Hurt who had so much more potential. The random sea of oil that has no function to the plot whatsoever. The knife wound that Theseus receives in the end but doesn't stop him - at least Maximus in Gladiator had the good grace to die after such a wound. The village that is undefendable despite the fact that its only obvious entrance is a narrow corridor cut into the stone of the cliffs themselves - as we all know, small narrow corridors are totally undefensible unless manned by half naked Greeks... oh wait. These things and others just pander to ridiculous pointless features that are there as padding for an empty film with barely enough strength of character to stand up on its own. I suspect the lifetime of this film is slightly less than its title puports.",

The script was quite poor, but from a 3D movie you cannot expect a very good script; few or no shocking, or impressive, or well thoughtful scenes, but then again there was no sign that this movie will have an unexpected end. The accent was put on the special effects, which, in my opinion, have no quality without a really good story. This is my first (ever, anywhere) review of a movie, but I still want to write this: few good trailers, with no false message, are made nowadays, but the idea with clips from the movie is something every producer should start promoting. Of course, nobody will go to cinemas unless you have really good clips, clips you can only find in really good movies.",

      "text": "I loved this movie. Not because it was without flaws. I'm a huge fan of the Hellenics. I do agree with many of the criticisms however. This movie doesn't explore the rich fantasy side of Greek mythology. But in a lot of ways, it's very faithful to Greek myths in terms of structure. To make the most out of the movie, it does help to know about some informational aspects because the film does a poor job at elaborating. There were details that were left to be inferred, like the values of burying the dead, the values of immortality, and the bull torture device (historically real). Those were all true to the Hellenic Greeks. Narratively, there were \"plot holes\". It's common in myths to not explain everything. Sometimes things just happen. I'm not saying the that story doesn't make sense, but there are moments that lack clear transition. Like classic Greek myths, the movie has superficial story telling. There isn't much if any character exploration or engagement. However, the classical themes of tragedy, heroism, fate, faith, and immortality are there. I accept these \"faults\" in terms of the format of myths. Myths don't have deep characterization or heavy drama. They are told quite directly. Although it may seem empty in regards to modern story telling, the story is faithful to the classic Greek hero tradition. There were some mildly questionable acting. Cavill thankfully gave a solid performance. I was worried especially since he's lined up to be the next Superman. I understood everything Rourke was saying, but I can understand if his mumbling gets annoying. I interpreted it to reveal how his character felt forsaken. His rage was masking his bitterness and depression. All of his actions were essentially trying to wave the finger at the gods for letting him down. The ladies in the movie were generally stoic, but life was tougher then and the story only allowed one emotional scene for Pinto's character. The direction by Tarsem was quite spectacular. It's already widely agreed that the movie is visually amazing. The action is just as amazing and definitely pays off in the end. It's not all slo-mo or over stylized. Tarsem made human fights intense and in real-time which contrasted to the power of the Gods who were shot in slo-mo and had stunning, acrobatic movement. The sound effects were dramatically phenomenal. They gave real dimension to the visuals. Speaking of the visuals, they weren't all eye candy. The slow, panning close-ups of the labyrinth's walls really gave off the dizzying confusion of being in a maze. In fact, there were several very visceral scenes where you're made to feel exactly what was happening. Your ears ring; your eyes get blurry. The most interesting aspect of Immortals for me was the blend of realism and mythology. It plays on how myths may have been conceived. The movie is told visually as myth, within a reality, within a myth. I'll explain. Theseus's world is meant to be real, and in his world there are myths of gods who some doubt exists. Theseus' own story becomes a myth depicted on a statue at the end. The movie itself is a myth and that's why it's theatrically stylized. This interesting approach puts a new spin on the interpretation of gods. The gods and titans are presumably the same race of super beings. They have the same helmets and abilities. As the movie mentions, \"history is decided by the victors\", therefore the self-dubbed Gods are considered good. It's a little jab on the one-sidedness of myths/stories. I enjoyed the interpretation of youthful gods. They weren't necessarily magical beings. They were very human, which is how they are suppose to be. Even if the story seems uninteresting at times, I think the action and style more than makes up for it. If you're a fan of classic heroes, superheroes, amazing style, gritty action, or looking at hot people, I think you will find the movie enjoyable. If you're a fan of Hellenic Greek culture, even better. This movie isn't an adaptation. It's a modern myth that takes all its cues from Hellenic stories. It's not an intricate movie story-wise, but there is good film-making going on. Tarsem's action and visuals provide plenty of entertainment to a fresh interpretation of Greek stories.",

In many aspects I feel this movie has knocked 300 down a notch especially in the visuals. All of the fight scenes were insanely awesome and well done. Tarsem also utilized 3D better than most movies that support it. For the people that are fans of the art style and love blood and gore, this movie will not disappoint. The acting was okay. Mickey Rourke was the best of the crew and was a real ball buster. The story strayed from the written in stone mythology but its forgivable because the gods were insanely awesome. The last fight, which lasts roughly 20 mins, is the best bit of cinematography I've seen in a very long time and made me say **** YES!\" the whole time. Pretty much the bottom line is if you like violent gory fantasy war movies don't let the story and acting stray you away, its not bad enough to make you regret watching it despite what other reviews say.

The characters are as 2-dimesional as they come, but at least their the fun sort of 2-dimesional characters that you can root for.  Henry Cavill steels the show as Theseus and Mickey Rourke plays a great King Hyperion.  Cavill's ability to play the hero make me happy that he is going to be the next Superman.  Mickey Rourke plays Hyperion all sorts of ruthless and unyielding (and awesome).  The supporting cast did their job well, but saddly the script didn't them give too much attention, especially the priestess (the fact that I can't remember her name is proof enough).  As someone who loves Greek Myths up the wahzoo, I enjoyed the beginning of the movie and thought is a decent action movie with good visuals.  Then Ares came down and started doing things that turned this movie from a decent action flick with good visuals to an awesome action flick with good visuals.  Seeing the gods fight the titans at the end made me all sorts of wide eyed.  Saying the climax of this movie is amazing is an understatement.  The ending was kind of \"Bleh\" in my opinion and seemed like the movie was going for a sequel (let's hope not, sequels kill movies like these).  All and all, this is a great action movie that you can just watch with your friends and have a fun time.  This is what Clash of the Titans should have been but saddly wasn't.  People who are saying this movie lacks depth and have a boring script are missing the point.  Greek Myths aren't incredibly deep, so why should an adaptation of a Greek Myth be any different.

The plot was supposed to be about keeping a magical bow out of the evil King Hyperion's hands (played by a mumbling Mickey Rourke), but the bow really didn't come into play much.  King Hyperion gets his hands on the bow and uses it once to break open a gate and that's it.  I also have an issue with poor audio and actors mumbling their words so that you couldn't understand them.  The acting ranged from mediocre to good.  I'm still giving the movie a pass because the visuals were great.  The 3D was slightly above average, but the computer drawn vistas looked superb.  The fight scenes were gory and exciting.

Yes, everything was designed in studio BUT IT WAS WELL DESIGNED! And NO armours are NO in plastic just because you see armors shinning doesn't necessarily mean it is fake.

      "text": "Skimming the user reviews, I noticed more consensus than usual with \"Immortals.\" Most reviewers seemed to agree that the film features stunning visuals with weak storytelling; what they disagreed about was the relative value of these qualities. Those handing out eights and nines tended to assert (or imply) that strong storytelling was unnecessary--possibly even detrimental--to an action film. Some claimed that criticizing the script was exposing shameful ignorance of what makes an action movie great: spectacle, gory spectacle, and really gory spectacle. Red-zone reviewers, on the other hand, claimed spectacle was enhanced by strong storytelling--or even, in some cases, dependent upon it. My rating identifies me as one of this latter group--though perhaps not as adamant as some. In part because I'm so charmed by the enthusiasm of green-zone reviewers (\"more awesome than Zeus and Chuck Norris fighting to the death on a cloud of Ferraris\"), I have genuinely tried to understand how good storytelling could be irrelevant to--or, more puzzling, could detract from--the visual and visceral thrills of a great action movie, but my own viewing experience seems to prove the opposite. I simply can't think of a single action film that I would call great--or even good--despite weak storytelling. Which brings me to the truly inexcusable fault in \"Immortals,\" which is that, in the character of Theseus, the filmmakers have strong storytelling already in hand. Through plays, poetry, and prose, modern filmmakers have inherited an array of fabulous stories about the gods, demigods, mortals, and other creatures of Greek mythology. Especially the great warrior-king!  So why don't they use them? This is not pedantry; it's genuine bafflement about why filmmakers would ignore rich, dramatic, coherent stories, all thousands of years beyond the reach of copyright, in favor of thin, sketchy, incoherent assemblages that, to add insult, they have to pay for. I'm waiting for someone with Tarsem Singh's visual genius to tackle, say, THE BACCHAE, using Euripides's script. THAT would be more awesome than Zeus, Chuck Norris, Bruce Lee, and Sol Invictus fighting after death--and after a feast of nectar, ambrosia, and soma in Valhalla--on a cloud of Lamborghinis and Aston Martins!",

Their re-imagining of the gods didnt sit well for me at all. Overall, Its just another film trying to re-capture what 300 had and it fails to do so (FYI - it was produced by the producers of 300), Just another disapointing action film imo.",

      "text": "Immortals has some fantastic visuals, with stylishly brutal Ancient Greek action that out-300s 300 (if that makes sense). It also has some striking and creative visual effects, particularly in the way the gods of Olympus transform from their mortal to divine forms. Henry Cavill and Mickey Rourke make a convincing action hero and entertaining hammy villain respectively, and John Hurt and Stephen Dorff's gravelly tones add a little interest to the film's less than inspiring dialogue. The film's story, however, is all over the place both in terms of pacing and original ideas - stop-start-stop-start, hit-miss-hit-miss, until it finally strikes the right balance in an entertaining final act. Frida Pinto is left with very little to do as the only feminine presence in a world fuelled by testosterone, and it's a little insulting to the viewer's intelligence to believe that a celibate oracle would abandon her vow of chastity for the first handsome man she meets. The costumes and CGI-extended sets are striking, but also a little jarring - a little like watching Ancient Greece via the Star Wars prequels. Like his previous feature The Fall, director Tarsem Singh demonstrates that he has some interesting ideas, and a good eye for colourful, unusual visuals, but is not as skilled at bringing the whole package together as a full, workable film. Immortals has a lot to like, but it's too flawed and incomplete to make any real mark.",
