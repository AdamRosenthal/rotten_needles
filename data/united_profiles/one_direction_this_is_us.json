What makes the film sloppy and incoherent is the fact that much of the scenes are out of place. For example, one moment you are listening to them in concert and the next you're seeing them on \"The X-Factor\". Additionally, some scenes give off a staged feeling such as when Liam and Harry are talking on the dock. Finally, it is blatantly obvious by the structure of the film that the studio rushed to get this out there fully knowing that it would make a ton of money.",

Fans on the internet have uncovered just how controlling their management and label really is and it's quite clear in the way the film is formatted (song, \"our fans are great\", screaming fans, song, \"our fans\", screaming fans, song) that the one thing the team behind 1D doesn't want us to know is that the boys are actually well worth their fame and accolades.  They deserve to be praised for their talent and personalities but the label was, at this point, clearly hoping to just cash in and move on.
