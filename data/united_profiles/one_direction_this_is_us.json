But there are moments of screwy honesty  a couple chats with obviously heartsick parents stick out as counterpoints to the celebration  and the actual concert moments are both better entwined and more explosively captured than anything of this popdoc ilk has so far managed (looking at you, Bieber and Perry). In short, there is nothing you wouldn\u2019t expect, but at least it\u2019s all done with flair. And it\u2019s not like it\u2019s made for anyone but the teenage girls who saw the concert the first time through anyway.",

The guys themselves are charming, smart and talented.  The image they have to uphold is not.  It was very clear that there's the band and there's the phenomenon - as two separate entities.  Fans on the internet have uncovered just how controlling their management and label really is and it's quite clear in the way the film is formatted (song, \"our fans are great\", screaming fans, song, \"our fans\", screaming fans, song) that the one thing the team behind 1D doesn't want us to know is that the boys are actually well worth their fame and accolades.  They deserve to be praised for their talent and personalities but the label was, at this point, clearly hoping to just cash in and move on.  Go figure, that's the nature of a cutthroat industry, I guess.",
