This film however is nothing like any film that has come out of that studio. Dead Man Down is smart, WAY smarter than I thought it was going to be. I decided to take chance and catch the midnight premier of this film because of the Cast, I just had this feeling that Noomi Rapace wouldn't take an awful roll. I was right. The pace is fantastic, It's not a full throttle action film. The action is placed perfectly between good character development and pleasing dialog. Noomi Rapace is BRILLIANT. After seeing her in Prometheus and Dead Man Down, I can confidently say she's one of my favorite actresses. She captures emotion like no other. Something about her performances just captivate you. My one complaint would be that I wanted better, cleaner kill shots. The violence is kind of Teen Rated video game like, Not that it doesn't work, Like i said the action is just right, but the execution is a little off. Being an action film fan maybe I'm spoiled by such violence in the Expendables and Django. Bottom line, This movie is a hell of a lot smarter than the critics are saying it is. If you want a film that keeps you entertained in all the right ways, give it a shot! It may have you leaving thinking the same thing that was in my head:  That was a WWE Film?!\"",

The film follows Victor (Colin Farrell), a local kingpins right hand man who is planning revenge against the men who killed his family. However when Beatrice (Noomi Rapace), his neighbour witnesses him murder someone in his apartment he is forced to do something for her that may mean his downfall or his salvation. There is no nice way to say it, this is a bad movie, it lacks believable characters, a decent draw and a reason to root for the central character, in fact for the first 30 minutes he just murders people with no justification behind it just because they have guns (because that's a reason to kill anyone in action films apparently). Now Colin Farrell isn't a bad actor, in fact he's quite a good one but he needs the right material and the script in Dead Man Down is just confusing. It's filled with nonsense twists that just make its two leads seem like schizophrenics as it supposedly builds to a tepid finale filled with fake emotions and ridiculously overworked messages that are so heavy-handed it just annoys you. It's filled with uninvolving resolutions and one of the dumbest final conversations in movie history. Rapace has to cope with the worst of it as her character flip flops around unsure on what she is doing, so much so that in one scene she is hitting on Victor and then suddenly she starts yelling at him for no reason, none whatsoever. It's not just a poor script though, its so poorly filmed and packaged it doesn't even qualify as an action film because those scenes are dull and unimpressive. It;s a poor picture unworthy of its two leads.",

It wasn't terrible, but it never really broke out as fully entertaining. I guess it is better than sitting in a bus stop watching the dregs of humanity fall over themselves while trying to walk and breath at the same time. What is most striking in this film is that Colin Farrell didn't completely ruin it as is his usual impact films. Before anyone tells me they like Colin Farrell go watch Alexander...enough said. Here he was serviceable which for him is a darn near Oscar caliber tour de force of acting.",

Colin Farrell broods as he does so well, as a man who's plotting revenge on the gangsters who killed his wife and daughter. To drag down the plot, we suffer thru an awkward relationship with a damaged woman (Noomi Rapace). While there are three short spurts of action, there's more than 90 minutes of brooding character drama. Slow, gloomy dialogue. Long, lackluster encounters. It's really not worth suffering thru it just to see a truck drive into a house.",

I've enjoyed the last seven of his movies including this rather interesting gangster flick with the talented Noomi Rapace co- starring. There are two reasons for me seeing this Niels Arden Oplev film because he directed Noomi in the well known 'Girl With the Dragon Tattoo' then there is the fact that he's in production on a Stephen King film  'Under The Dome' and being a 'King' fan I was keen to see how it might be handled. The Dane is definitely one of the better directors out there and done a great job on 'Dead Man Down'. It certainly had a strong eastern European look and feel which made for a tight, gritty action laden thriller that had me enjoying every minute.",
