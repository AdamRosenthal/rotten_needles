Specifically it\u2019s suggested he may have been shot by Robert De Niro who plays Colonel Benjamin Something.  Now 18 years later, Vengeful Ex-Soldier has bought some American military personnel files off a bloke in a pub.  One of the files is on Colonel Benjamin Something.  \u201cI have been waiting 18 years to do a revenge film with De Niro\u201d says Vengeful Ex-Soldier to the bloke in the pub, who seems to be losing interest.",

      "text": "Killing Season is a movie that thrills and leaves you thinking. It is timely because the tension echoes many of the current situations going on in society. In their own right each of the two in the movie have their reasons (and justifications) for their points and places. In the end (sorry, no spoiler here) the stark realization of the view from the other side really brings home the powerful moral of this movie. De Niro is his usual amazing self and Travolta delivers a nearly convincing eastern bloc persona. Well worth seeing.",
