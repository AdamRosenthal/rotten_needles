The film allows for these characters to fully live and have dimension, and much of it's core and heart, comes from the interaction of the actors. The director is also very successful in capturing the frailty of children's lives and expectations, as is in the way it captures the hardship of a young relationship and the steps to becoming a responsible adult. The threads that the film successfully builds are as delicate as they are strong in it's emotional impact. Brie Larson has a fantastic performance as the experienced, yet frail Grace, as does Kaitlyn Dever as the young Jayden. The film also benefits from the beautiful cinematography from Brett Pawlak. A great film not to be missed.",

It has been my viewing experience that, in most instances, when the writer is also the director of the film, the movie tends to be too long and improperly edited since the creator can\u2019t seem to delete and take out the unnecessary footage for fear of hurting his or her work. Objectivity usually is replaced by sentiment and loyalty to the original product, regardless of its effect on the audience. Mr. Cretton proved that the opposite can be true for this film is wonderfully edited and plays out smooth as silk as it tells the tale of staffers in a foster care facility and the problems they experience with their teen age wards. It should be noted that Mr. Cretton worked in such a facility so there is legitimacy and honesty in his writing about it. There are subplots and small divergences which make for an interesting cinema experience. Ms. Larson is a talented actress with natural beauty and ability and the script affords her the opportunity to utilize her thespian skills so that you are ab;e tp identify with her and the difficulties in her life. In spite of all of the travails facing these workers and wards,, the movie is uplifting and gives us all hope and the ability to believe that no one is beyond help and redemption. I enthusiastically recommend it and give the film an 8 rating.. Watch for some of the cast to be mentioned when Oscar time rolls around because there are performances in this film you will remember for a long time to come.",
