Also, the movie is super negative towards Americans...and Obama gets his head blown off, and that's supposed to be funny?",

      "text": "Kingsman: The Secret Service is a loud, obnoxious, stupid, and over the top action film that fails to not just properly spoof the spy genre it tries to mock, but also fails to be a spy film at all. Firstly, the action sequences are well done, but are completely pointless and over the top (thanks to stupid CGI blood effects). In line with this, the plot as a whole was beyond dumb and unbelievable. Spy films, though often outlandish, deal with things that you could see actually happening. This one felt more like a science fiction film masquerading as a spy film, while not being completely either. In addition, the writing was incredibly weak. I have no problem with swearing, but it was used as a crutch throughout and overused. Finally, it was never funny. For a film trying to be a satire of spy films, it was never funny and the jokes fell flat every time. Oh and lest we forget the stupid ending with the reference to anal sex. The joke fell flat and I am not a huge fan of nudity, unless it makes sense. Here, it was sexed up for the hell of it, which to me, is the sign of a bad movie that needs to have sex scenes to make things interesting. The only positive I can think of, other than the well shot action scenes, was the acting. In particular, Samuel L. Jackson was great. However, on the whole, Kingsman: The Secret Service is a horrific film that baffles me how people enjoyed it. Stupid, stupid, stupid.",

The performance of the cast is perhaps one of the major factor that the film is extremely entertaining, it gathers four Kingsmen - Colin Firth, Mark Strong, Michael Caine and Samuel L. Jackson, in which each of them represent the characters that they are not used to be in other recent films, while it is also undeniable that young potential actor Taron Egerton sparks in his character as Eggsy too.

Anyone who thought this was entertaining has no clue about quality writing, screenplay.   James Bond rip offs were most atrocious and poorly done (got to dress properly, 'act' like James Bond, order your drink like bond (shaken, not stirred).   As in Bond films, we are drawn through the showcasing of all the neat gadgets the hero will eventually use to do in the bad guys.  The hero's persona was borrowed from the teen angst of the impulsive, smart, rawly talented likes of James T Kirk as late adolescent, the Superman-as-folksy-farm kid.  Oh., but we need to have him prove out----we'll have him compete with other teen-young adult peers and 'win' the competition (see X-Men); and we need to throw in a strong heroine  who has to depend on the hero for self-confidence and courage (make her good looking but never have her evidence any special talent or skill; but the main characters can't all be guys, right?).   One of the worst rip-off films in the last 10 year; entertaining perhaps, if you have little movie-going history under your belt.   Even the humor was ripped off ('.....you'll have to excuse me while I go save the world').   Emotional emphasis by all of the charactersswas totally reliant on using the f-word in every major scene (truly, this got to be dreadfully dull after the first hour.)    We have to throw in the political issue of global warming as the impetus for the bad guy (who as we know, has limit-less wealth to do any evil he wants).   I'd give the movie '1/2 of a 'star' ; and I wish to heck I could get my movie ticket money back on this one.",

The lisp-y arch villain was played well by Samuel L. Jackson but I think he was still mis-cast. Someone like Terrence Stamp (\"General Zod\" in \"Superman II\") would've been more \"deliciously evil\". This and a few other quibbles like the small statured new Kingsmen keep it from a \"10\" rating.

It, being a little of a parody of James Bond, has a really good story, beautiful shots, really unexpected twists, and it will make you laugh from the beginning to the end, also having really nice action scenes, really well directed and with a camera work really masterful. But really, the action scenes were really awesome, perfectly choreographed, and I just love the fact that here really is presented a combination of old school British spy films to modern day action espionage. The movie is unrealistic, predictable and ridiculous in some parts, but it is that in purpose, which makes it even a better film, really fun to watch and very entertaining. The acting is great, mainly by Samuel L. Jackson playing and excellent, original, eccentric, really cool and funny villain. The story is a little unoriginal, but it\u2019s nothing to be concerned about.",

Everyone calls this movie 'fun' and 'an awesome spy movie' when all I saw was some confused writing and bland characters being thrown on film. And don't get me wrong I know it's supposed to be a parody of the old spy movies but it's seriously executed poorly. I mean, even from the first moment of the film you're confused when the bouncy bubbly letters of the title come in and you think to yourself \"What spy movie introduces itself with bouncy letters??\" This is just a taste of some of the confused writing that the film contains. Honestly there's not much more I can say about this movie without repeating myself but seriously I don't recommend this movie to anyone but I guess I'm wrong because whenever I bring this movie up to my friends they loved it so I guess I'm a minority here. To drive the point home, Samuel Jackson is the villain in this movie. Cool right? No, because they turn him into a backwards-hat-wearing teenage douchebag who spouts catchphrases and language that makes no sense in the movie. The only thing that saves this movie from a 1 or a 2 out of 10 is the action scenes that are fairly well choreographed and use slow-motion to actually show the action and it's pretty well done. Other than that though I didn't find anything worth seeing.",

The villain was the brightest light in the movie and we really didn't care much about the side characters, did we?",

The fast edited fight scenes go on way too long, it's really violent, and the film can't really decide if it's an all out comedy or drama. At times it has \"Airplane\" type of humour, like it's making fun of the spy genre, and other times heavy on the drama. At one point they even poke fun of product placement in movies with McDonalds, again showing the \"Airplane\" style of satirical humour. Somehow it all worked for me mainly due to the spirited acting by everyone involved. Not really a film I would desire to see again but fun for an afternoon.",

It's developed and involved enough to keep you engaged, but it's got just the right amount of fun and self-awareness to make it this easy and fun to watch. A great cast bring everything to life, and great direction guides the story, and the incredibly bad-ass action, to an explosive finale. It's bloody good fun.",

There are many pluses, not least well know actors playing against type, notably Colin Firth ditching his diffident middle class Englishman persona for a super smooth but hard as nails secret agent. Mark Strong plays a good guy rather than his usual villainous roles. Secondly there is humour throughout, even during the southern redneck church scene. In a film full of surprises this is the shocker so much so I had to replay it just to make sure I hadn't imagined it.  Maybe the only downside is that the director chose to depict exploding heads as colourful fireworks rather than opting for a bit of a bloodbath but tis is a moot point.",
