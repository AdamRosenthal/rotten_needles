Firstly, the action sequences are well done, but are completely pointless and over the top (thanks to stupid CGI blood effects). In line with this, the plot as a whole was beyond dumb and unbelievable. Spy films, though often outlandish, deal with things that you could see actually happening. This one felt more like a science fiction film masquerading as a spy film, while not being completely either. In addition, the writing was incredibly weak. I have no problem with swearing, but it was used as a crutch throughout and overused. Finally, it was never funny. For a film trying to be a satire of spy films, it was never funny and the jokes fell flat every time. Oh and lest we forget the stupid ending with the reference to anal sex. The joke fell flat and I am not a huge fan of nudity, unless it makes sense. Here, it was sexed up for the hell of it, which to me, is the sign of a bad movie that needs to have sex scenes to make things interesting. The only positive I can think of, other than the well shot action scenes, was the acting. In particular, Samuel L. Jackson was great. However, on the whole, Kingsman: The Secret Service is a horrific film that baffles me how people enjoyed it. Stupid, stupid, stupid.",

Since 2005, thanks to the likes of Martin Campbell and Christopher Nolan, two directors that took two very different iconic action figures, Batman and James Bond, and injected a much needed, gritty, dark, reality-based foundation to these characters and their overall narratives, over-the-top action has long been expired. In the last decade, what has arisen, is a very dark and realistically twisted take on many action icons, both in the superhero genre and the action hero genre, that allows the cartoonish elements of these characters to fade, and the realistic to rise in popular and rewarding box office results.",

It has the R rating for a reason and it uses that rating to its full extent with enthralling action scenes that give me flashbacks to Matrix reloaded (in a good way). The acting was pretty good, Colin was awesome as the very slick super agent Harry Heart that acts as a sudo father figure for our main character Garry\"Eggsy\"Unwin who was portrayed by Taron Egerton, Tarons acting was pretty good and only gets better as the character evolves into the James Bond style character that all the commercials tries to sell you. The movie will keep you engaged as the fairly vanilla but still silly plot unfolds. I mentioned that the movie has quite a bit of less then politically correct humor, if you are really sensitive to that kind of humor then i suggest that you spare your money and don't go and watch this because you probably don`t like fun and you will probably not like this.",

Filled with effects, a surprisingly high quality of acting (Firth, Jackson and Strong are absolutely brilliant) and a vast amount of comedy, 'Kingsman' is a new James Bond version that surpasses all of the parodies that have used spy movies as a basis.",

James Bond rip offs were most atrocious and poorly done (got to dress properly, 'act' like James Bond, order your drink like bond (shaken, not stirred).   As in Bond films, we are drawn through the showcasing of all the neat gadgets the hero will eventually use to do in the bad guys.  The hero's persona was borrowed from the teen angst of the impulsive, smart, rawly talented likes of James T Kirk as late adolescent, the Superman-as-folksy-farm kid.  Oh., but we need to have him prove out----we'll have him compete with other teen-young adult peers and 'win' the competition (see X-Men); and we need to throw in a strong heroine  who has to depend on the hero for self-confidence and courage (make her good looking but never have her evidence any special talent or skill; but the main characters can't all be guys, right?).   One of the worst rip-off films in the last 10 year; entertaining perhaps, if you have little movie-going history under your belt.   Even the humor was ripped off ('.....you'll have to excuse me while I go save the world').   Emotional emphasis by all of the charactersswas totally reliant on using the f-word in every major scene (truly, this got to be dreadfully dull after the first hour.)    We have to throw in the political issue of global warming as the impetus for the bad guy (who as we know, has limit-less wealth to do any evil he wants).   I'd give the movie '1/2 of a 'star' ; and I wish to heck I could get my movie ticket money back on this one.",

It straddled the line of satire and sincerity in an interesting way, mocking and embracing the genre's tropes simultaneously.  It was a solid movie with a lot of amazing sequences, but for me it just didn't quite come together.  However, I should freely admit that spy movies are not my favourite genre, so there were probably references I missed out on.  Still, an enjoyable romp-y kind of movie with fun action and dialogue.",

Whilst the films protagonists are developed with great quality, the film's antagonist, Samuel L. Jackson, steals the show with a brilliant portrayal of a power driven maniac.

It's full of the things you want and expect from a spy movie, Crazy Vilian played By Samuel Jackson with a bodyguard with swords for feet, Super Cool Gadgets, Great Action, Comedy....The list goes on. It's great to see a movie released in 2014 still have the charm of a classic film, Part of witch could be from the movie being based off a comic book as well. The action in this film is mapped out perfectly, With a great mix of plot and action that never feels out of balance. This film will also make you laugh with the main character always quick with a one liner to throw in. Kingsman surprised me I must admit tho, From previews etc I didn't have high hopes for the film but 30 minutes in my mind was changed..I loved this movie. If your a Fan of Old Spy movies or not you should still take some time to watch \"Kingsman: The Secret Service\" you will not regret it, Unless you don't like extreme violence then maybe skip this one",

Everyone calls this movie 'fun' and 'an awesome spy movie' when all I saw was some confused writing and bland characters being thrown on film. And don't get me wrong I know it's supposed to be a parody of the old spy movies but it's seriously executed poorly. I mean, even from the first moment of the film you're confused when the bouncy bubbly letters of the title come in and you think to yourself \"What spy movie introduces itself with bouncy letters??\" This is just a taste of some of the confused writing that the film contains. Honestly there's not much more I can say about this movie without repeating myself but seriously I don't recommend this movie to anyone but I guess I'm wrong because whenever I bring this movie up to my friends they loved it so I guess I'm a minority here. To drive the point home, Samuel Jackson is the villain in this movie. Cool right? No, because they turn him into a backwards-hat-wearing teenage douchebag who spouts catchphrases and language that makes no sense in the movie. The only thing that saves this movie from a 1 or a 2 out of 10 is the action scenes that are fairly well choreographed and use slow-motion to actually show the action and it's pretty well done.

It is a wonderful addition to my collection of Bond, Bourne, Mission Impossible films and it fills a gap those films never show.  This film does have it's campy and over the top moments, but all the actors, even the younger ones, do a phenomenal job in this flick.  I've always been a fan of Firth, Strong, Jackson and these 3 are just sooo great on screen (and there's also the added bonus of seeing Mark Hammill and Michael Caine, even if briefly) that their performances and action scenes alone make it worth spending money on.  This is a film I'd love to see get a sequel and I hope people will spend money to show support for the people who made this film possible.",

The fast edited fight scenes go on way too long, it's really violent, and the film can't really decide if it's an all out comedy or drama. At times it has \"Airplane\" type of humour, like it's making fun of the spy genre, and other times heavy on the drama. At one point they even poke fun of product placement in movies with McDonalds, again showing the \"Airplane\" style of satirical humour. Somehow it all worked for me mainly due to the spirited acting by everyone involved. Not really a film I would desire to see again but fun for an afternoon.",

There are many pluses, not least well know actors playing against type, notably Colin Firth ditching his diffident middle class Englishman persona for a super smooth but hard as nails secret agent. Mark Strong plays a good guy rather than his usual villainous roles. Secondly there is humour throughout, even during the southern redneck church scene. In a film full of surprises this is the shocker so much so I had to replay it just to make sure I hadn't imagined it.  Maybe the only downside is that the director chose to depict exploding heads as colourful fireworks rather than opting for a bit of a bloodbath but tis is a moot point.",
