Like, there is a scene when the girl is sleeping with the other girls and she gets a late night visit from Abalam. Well, just ignore everyone else...and just touch her? It felt like I was watching a censored or blocked version of the movie. Some of the acting was decent, but the supposded boyfriend was not very convincing to me. He at first was a random guy, and then turns out to be a stalker and then gets possessed? The sound effects and visual effects are solid for this movie, but these are the things that make horror movies the best. Unfortunately, this movie failed to get me have the feeling of being scared, either build up horror or sudden horror. Some characters were also a waste and not much story around them. Overall, a decent movie. But fell short on delivering the scary moments when it needed to. And too many boring, wasted scenes and characters.",

With a new director but the same actress as the first film, Ashley Bell. \"Part II\" is straight up horror story telling in a classic format. There is no documentary style footage present save the internet shot of the footage from the first film so the opportunity to really utilize basic but brilliant gimmicks for shock and thrills are very well in hand for this film. Which I think the director managed to use quite well without being too obvious or any real \"fail\" issue for the most part.",
