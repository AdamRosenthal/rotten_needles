On the plus side Thomas Haden Church (Leo Holt) and Hannibal Buress (Griff) were actually the funniest parts of the film, playing their parts pretty well despite being minor characters.

      "text": "Not all that funny a few laughs but co-writer director Sean Anders (Horrible Bosses 2) manages to put charm and wackiness into this comedy and makes the collaboration with Will Ferrell and Mark Wahlberg priceless, where the chemistry with each other is nice. The problem I had with this film is it's a mediocre comedy with bland performances, but it's a good comedy. Will Ferrell plays Brad Taggart a radio executive, who has a big heart and wants to be the best step-father ever to his wife's (Linda Cardellini) two children (Scarlett  Estevez and Owen Vaccaro). When her bad boy ex-husband Dusty (Mark Wahlberg) comes back to town, Brad feels insecure about him being there, Dusty wants to get back together with Sarah, so him and Brad have a competition on who wins the family. Dusty demonstrates his flair for athletics, home repair and bad boy charisma. So Brad finds himself in a tough situation to battle one-up his rival and win his family. Despite wasting talented comedy stars Will Ferrell and Mark Whalberg, they make bland performances, but they make this movie rock, still an enjoyable film despite it's a mediocre PG-13 comedy. 3 out 5 stars",

I had heard that this film has aimed for more of a family audience, but I really didn't get that vibe. This is not a kids movie at all. Anyone who has seen The Other Guys knows that Mark Wahlberg and Ferrell have chemistry and it is one of the most important parts of this film and that was what kept it on an enjoyable level because I was not laughing out loud at all the jokes. The cast is pretty solid. I really liked the addition of Hannibal Burress, he was one of the funniest characters in the film although he really didn't need to be there. There is so much product placement in Daddy's Home that it almost feels like they are parodying it. There is a pretty good amount of heart in this movie and although the story is not exactly the most believable its still a warming end.",

Then expect to be monumentally disappointed by the lack of all those comedic elements that make a good comedy.
