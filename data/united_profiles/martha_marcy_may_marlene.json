      "text": "While this is getting rave reviews, I personally had a miserable time with \"Martha Marcy May Marlene.\" First of all, in any movie the characters need to go through some kind of transformation so we can understand what they're going through. In a way, Martha does change. There are a series of flashbacks that show her happy and carefree as she settles into the cult of a sex crazed looney. Then we see her psychologically damaged after she's escaped and living with her sister. But the movie establishes these two sides of Martha early on and very little is done in the end to give us a complete picture of who Martha is as a person. I also didn't care too much for the outcome of her character. While Elizabeth Olsen gives a knockout debut performance, I found her character to be very self-centered and foolish. First, she was stupid to have joined the cult and believe all of the stupid babble the leader spewed on her. Then she refuses to even hint at what happened to her with her sister. I understand that a person would have a hard time opening up about traumatic events, but they at least need to understand that she's been through some messed up times. She never lets them know. It becomes very frustrating to deal with. Then to top it all off, the movie ends at a random point. I felt like I went through enough trouble in this film to get some kind of conclusion, but the movie leaves us with none. I saw a lot of similarities between \"Martha Marcy May Marlene\" and \"Take Shelter,\" but the biggest differences for me were the characters and execution. The characters in \"Take Shelter\" were compelling enough that it could end on a cliffhanger and get away with it. The characters in \" Martha\" on the other hand, were rather unlikable. Also, the ending is beautifully executed in \"Take Shelter,\" while in \"Marcy\" the movie ends like the projectionist forgot to put on the last reel.",

It doesn't knock you over the head with it's bluntness. It becomes more and more stressful as you see more of both stories.

The movies disturbing narrative exceeds making hairs stand up on you neck, it painfully pricks them leaving you with no choice but to continue watching, yes that's a good thing. Watching \"MMMM\" re-develop her relationship with her sister, (or should I stay corrupt further) was more intense to watch than the cult like farm life. The movie has good cinematography and Olsens performance is better than the older sisters life work combined. I hope the academy recognizes her performance.",

After watching the film and reading what people were saying I just felt like I had missed something very important. I never once felt that the cult, whose practices she seemed to embrace were coming after her. For the bulk of the flashbacks, or whatever you want to call them, she seemed to be okay with whatever bizarre rituals were taking place. I don't know what she was so afraid of. But still, this Olsen twin who appears to have eaten a meal in her life, was interesting to watch. Her interactions with her sister were the moments where I felt the most on edge. Captivating stuff.  I desperately wanted to understand her fear, but the film didn't have me buying it.",

      "text": "There is a quiet dread that lurks over every scene in Sean Durkin's masterful feature debut, Martha Marcy May Marlene. The movie tells a story of a young woman, Martha, who flee's an abusive cult and stays with her sister. While safe with her family, Martha's growing paranoia takes over as the film shifts effortlessly between reality, dream, and memory. We see what Martha sees. The film features a breakout performance from Elizabeth Olsen who is magnetic in the title role. She delivers the breakout performance of the year and I hope that it takes her as far as last years Jennifer Lawrence and she is awarded with an Oscar nomination. There has been a lot of talk revolving around the ambiguity of the movie. There are no answers for some of what we see on screen but I gather that that is the point. The movie is told from Martha's perspective. We are left to wonder, just like her, how much of what is going on is real or in her mind. Martha Marcy May Marlene is a glorious feature with strong performances, beautiful cinematography and editing, and an ending that will leave many frustrated by its ambiguity but also reward everyone with conversation after it is done. One of the best films of the year.",

As she attempts to settle in to a normal life with her sister, she is haunted by horrible images from the past, where she had become part of a hippie commune led by the persuasive and charismatic Patrick. Martha's nightmares, fear, and paranoia continue to build until she is unable to separate her dreams from reality. First-time director Sean Durkin has struck immediate success with MARTHA MARCY MAY MARLENE, the award-winning cult drama from 2011. Durkin delicately interlaces the past and the present as he retells Martha's chilling experiences using an organic story structure. It is terrifying to think just how easily an impressionable mind could be manipulated and controlled in such a way, but Durkin takes all of the right steps in disarming the audience in the same way that Patrick has disarmed his followers, perfectly illustrating the power of coercion and the psychological lures that draw people in to such a group. Elizabeth Olsen is phenomenal as Martha, and commits herself mind, body, and soul. There are moments where Martha makes contact with the viewer and causes them to turn away in shame for intruding into her thoughts and emotions. John Hawkes is deadly as Patrick, coming on with a subtle charm that effectively seduces the other characters under his spell before corrupting their minds. MARTHA MARCY MAY MARLENE will not be easily forgotten, and is a top-contender for Best in 2011.",
