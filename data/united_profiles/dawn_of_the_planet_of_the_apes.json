Dawn really is something that deserves appreciation; few films in our day can only dream of achieving what Dawn has.

Thankfully, everyone involved was fully aware of that and delivered another smart blockbuster with a lot of vital commentary on the futility of war and violent conflicts. The film doesn't want you to pick a side too easily as hostility between the last remaining humans on Earth and the intelligent apes arise. There are decent and bad characters on both sides. This makes for an interesting ride, as the conflict spins more and more into chaos and there is little anyone can do against it, after a point of no return. Once again, the CGI is incredible, thanks to great motion capture acting and the accompanying special effects. Thankfully, the human actors are en par, especially Gary Oldman only takes two short scenes to make a strong point for being one of the best of his generation. The gloomy atmosphere, the great cinematography, it all adds up to an intelligent and pretty damn entertaining continuation of the story. If there is one complaint it would have to be that the ending is merely a cliffhanger for what's next in part three. But at least we all have something to look forward to.",

      "text": "So far, this summer, movie wise, has been pretty meh. Some movies, like 22 Jump Street and X-Men stood out to be great films, but some have been poor. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is not only a great film, but a masterpiece that far exceeds all of its predecessors, from the original film to the good prequel Rise of the Planet of the Apes. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is flawless in every way possible, from the plot to the CGI. The acting was generally solid, but nothing too special. However, Serkis is unbelievably good as Caesar once again and Toby Kebbell is even better as Koba. The plot created by Matt Reeves and co. is action packed, smart, emotional, and, in general, beautiful (for the lack of a better word). However, the apes were the stars of the show. Caesar, Maurice, Blue Eyes, and especially Koba were all great and each took on significant roles in the film. Lastly, the CGI. The effects in this film are the best I've possibly ever seen in a film. It was so realistic you would think the ape actors were in costumes. In general, this film is a must see this summer and easily turned an OK movie summer to a great one. This movie will make your summer.",

Which is pretty easy to imagine. Some humans and some intelligent apes have a conflict and it escalates. No matter how much action and drama you push along with such a story, it's limited in its potential. I had fun interpreting it as a metaphor for the Iraq oil invasion though.

Therefore, it is with unreserved enthusiasm that I can recommend whole heartedly this latest chapter in the simian saga. The whole package just couldn't have been put together better, but it has to be said that a lion's share of the credit has to go to director Matt Reeves who previously thrilled us with his visually stunning and equally dark 'Cloverfield'. Helped by a surprisingly dense and impressive screenplay he has managed to inject in to familiar proceedings, depth of character, excitement, pathos and suspense and yet has still found time to inventively position the camera to jaw dropping effect. There is even some slow motion, 360 degree camera pans and knock out crane shots. In fact we have everything here but the kitchen sink and it all works beautifully. The story is good and there is definite deliberation in the pacing which is perfectly judged and balances the action sequences with the many quieter and more reflective moments.",

The writing was good, the acting was fantastic. It's amazing that we've reached a point with CGI where you totally empathise with and even shed some tears over some computer generated characters, but that's how I felt watching Caeser and the other apes. They certainly were the stars of the movie, with the human characters taking a back seat - but we wouldn't want it any other way. That said, some of the scenes when humans and the apes were connecting on a deeper level and building trust with each other were some of the strongest in the whole film. I think it's an allegory for the connection we need to make with animals and the environment - one that we have lost over the past few centuries. Some parts of the film I felt were a bit cliche and predictable though so that's why I'm giving it a 9. But overall it was engrossing and wonderful to watch. And my dad didn't fall asleep!

From the motion capture acting by Andy Serkis to the wonderful special effects this movie is a fulfilling and rewarding. Beginning ten years after Rise of the Planet of the Apes the ape leader Ceaser tries to maintain peace between the few human survivors of the Simian Flu and his tribe of apes. However, the peace is destroyed when Koba an ape who hates humans kills Ceaser and blames the humans. However, Ceaser is still alive and it is now up to him to take back his kingdom all while Koba and the apes are attacking the humans. Before the film came out I did not know what to think. However, I was surprised by the emotional level of the film and how you could really see the emotion on the faces of all the apes. Motion capture changed this film franchise for the better. Also the script is amazing as it really has a large level of depth to it. Now I come to the acting. Jason Clarke who portrays Malcom a human is wonderful and gives a level of emotion to his character. Andy Serkis however playing Ceaser steals the show as he rightfully should. His character is so complex and he portrays him perfectly.  In conclusion this film is a nearly perfect work of science fiction and will be remembered for years to come.",

Now, this second part of the new reboot manages to surpass expectations and gets the whole reboot to a new level. It keeps being very emotional and with a lot depth, but also, it gets dark and intense, even brutal in some way. It\u00b4s very well thought out and makes you want more after an intense but soft ending.

There are some scenes in this movie that are simply jaw dropping, especially the battle sequences.  The visual effects WILL at least get an Oscar nomination, unless either a miracle or giant pretentious snub occurs.  Dawn is more akin to the atmospheric and eerie movie that I wanted Rise to be.  Don't get me wrong, that was still a decent movie, but Dawn makes it look like crap in almost every area, except cgi.

They usually spoke very slowly, but when the word came out it was perfect English, so not sure why they couldn't speak faster.

      "text": "as a spectacle, Apes succeeds.  As a torch carrier of the \"smart, out-of-control-animal sci-fi\" genre, it's a snoozefest.  It wants to be more than \"the lost world\" with chimps though...it wants to be downright shakesperian, and at times IT IS.  But the overall plodding pace leaves you in the middle ground between mildly entertained and seen-it-all-before.  The amount of cliches packed into this film should have given the filmmakers pause and cued some more creativity as to how you film certain \"necessary\" scenes (SPOILERS: like when the fool brings a shotgun to the lakeside chimp retreat.  Okay, a SHOTGUN?!  A gun at all is ridiculous, but it pushes the story forward.  a little pistol, i could imagine hiding.  BUT A SHOTGUN?  hidden by a little blue blanket in your wide open tool chest? get out of here with that).  instead of playing with genre, which can result in great films we all buy on blu-ray, \"Apes\" feels like an attempt AT genre.  and if you don't nail a straight up genre attempt, the movie can easily become camp, or worse...boring.  But then again, when your fore bearer is the Planet of the Apes franchise, \"Avoiding Camp\" might have been this film's working title.  And in that regard it is a success on par with its predecessor.",

I watched it in 3D because the town there I live in was no option other than 3d so I watched it in 3d.I thought was going to be dead for me already because for what I know from my experiences 3D is just a way to gain more money at the box office by offering the viewers a device to watch the film thats gonna ruin the experience. Luckily it didnt happen with this one. I am glad it didnt and I am actually happy,kind of,that it screened in 3d because the 3d enhanced the feeling for this movie.The 3d format was vivid and it actually add to the involvement of the story. Talking about the story. The story was really really good and I am surprised to say this because I didnt expect this movie to impress,surprise and entertain me so much. The key elements like the action,the pacing and story were done really well. What I found most interesting was the character development. Every character was treated so well I thought I was dreaming because you dont expect this from a summer movie. This summer movie though,for me, I felt it was done with passion and dedication. It is a great movie and it is one of the year's best ones.",

      "text": "Rise of the Planet of the Apes was a pleasant surprise and hinted at a new era for the Planet of the Apes franchise. The sequel to that movie is here, and has it improved on its predecessor? Dawn of the Planet of the Apes does improve on its predecessor, but also packs in so much more that it makes me more than excited for sequels to this franchise. Let's start talking about the story. The main plot here is that most of mankind has been wiped out by the brutal Simian flu. However, there is still a large group of survivors in San Francisco, and they need fuel and power. A very small group of survivors start heading to the dam, but they come across the apes. The story gets so much deeper, and also offers many plot twists that were constantly amazing. The human characters here truly aren't the real shining stars, but they still offer things to the table. I cared about the main family and the other characters. The main character, which is also the father of the main family (Jason Clarke), was very, very good, and I loved seeing him interacting and talking with Caesar and his fellow apes. Speaking of Caesar and the apes, Andy Serkis here might just have performed the best motion capture performance ever as Caesar. One of the other main apes, Koba, is a true menace, but he never came off as generic. There's also a good amount of depth to him, too. Gary Oldman is basically known as the one who keeps control over the people. He doesn't like the apes at all, but he never came off like a cruel jerk, even though there wasn't an insane amount of depth to him. With the characters and story, Dawn offers so much emotional depth that is extremely smart and gripping. Have I forgot to talk about the CGI? It is simply outstanding. The apes look real. I know real is used a lot when talking about CGI, but I couldn't believe how amazed I was by how detailed the apes were. The action here becomes intense and amazing. I don't know about you, but I'd choose seeing apes riding horseback with dual-wield LMGs jumping over fire over anything this summer. While I won't spoil it here, the ending here is powerful. There was just one slight problem with it. It is that I thought the actual war between the apes and humans was left annoyingly hanging. Then again, it sets up for a sequel, and that's something I want more than anything in movies right now: a sequel to this phenomenal movie. Not only will Dawn of the Planet of the Apes be one of my favorite summer movies this year, it will be in my Top 5 out of 2014 for sure.",

All of you people in the user reviews giving this film a full 10/10 need to grow and pair of balls and stop recommending this **** As a long-term planet of the apes fan who expected nothing less than pure awesome from this film considering its source material, I believe this to be one of the worst films this year. I am shocked by the amount of people who outright ignore the piss-poor effort that had been poured into this blatant cash in. How anyone can be so blind and not see all of the incredibly obvious problems with this film baffles me. So, here we go. The writers and director both need a good slap in the face for the ****ty crap that they were bothered to deliver. The dialogue is cringeworthy, both for the apes and the humans. What's more, I remembered none of the characters names (besides Caesar from Rise) after the film, I don't even think they even mentioned half of their names, and all of them have cardboard personalities. Characters do the stupidest things and do 180 personality switches constantly. I sympathised with none of the characters, and you know you're watching crap when you hate every nameless **** the writers came up with in their film. On top of that, it's soooo **** boring. I can only name a handful of films I have actually fallen asleep in and this film is one of them. Sure, the first 15 minutes are pretty engaging and the battle is mildly entertaining but who wants to sit through an hours worth of boring **** to get there. Finally, and this is what pretty much ruins the film for me, the story is **** retarded. I challenge you to sum up the plot of this film briefly without sounding like the biggest **** mongoloid. All of the other Planet of the Apes films have plots that are easy to sum up but you're gonna be sat there talking for a while trying to easily explain what the **** is going on in this film. To simplify my opinion of the story, it has no proper beginning and no proper ending, brings nothing worthwhile to the franchise and sequel baits so **** hard, it pisses me off. So to sum up, the writing is terrible, the characters are completely unlikeable (therefore there is no emotion in this ****fest) and the story is retarded. If you're happy watching poorly-paced, self-indulged dribble then it rarely gets better than this. I gave this a 3/10 because that's the score I'd honestly give this film as opposed to a dishonest outright 0/10. It gets no lower because the special effects were convincing and I love this franchise, but I lost a lot of respect for it because of this film. And soon enough, we'll probably be seeing trailers for 'War of the Planet of the Apes' or whatever they decide to call it, but so help me god if they **** it up like they ****ed up this film...",

I thought the movie was a little slow to pick up but as soon as it did it was impressive. Both the main ape characters Caesar and Koba (played by Andy Serkis and Toby Kebbell respectfully) were great. I really enjoyed their intensity. The only complaint I have is that I would have liked to have seen more from Gary Oldman. It looks like he was going to have a bigger role in the film than he really did. This installment is just as good if not better than any of the Planet of the Ape films. I can't tell if I like it better than Rise of the Planet of the Apes or not.

A small of group of humans encounter them and want their permission to use the dam nearby to re-power their community downtown which is almost out of gas for their generators. Cesar lets them do their work and there is finally peace and trust after Cesar's wife is cured from her sickness. That is until Koba, an ape that has pure hatred towards the humans, shoots Cesar and gets more apes to burn down their community. He blames the humans on the attack and death of Cesar and tells them to go to war with the humans. They all go downtown and an intense battle ensues. The group from earlier that escaped the burning community find Cesar almost dead on the ground and take him back to his old house that we saw in Dawn and he gets fixed. His son, Blue Eyes (I think) frees the humans and captive apes downtown and Cesar takes down Koba and they all wait as war approaches from another city. (I didn't add all details fyi)",

The cgi was mostly seamless with some visuals slightly broken because there is evidently nothing real in the scene to as reference. As far as plot, it's as good as a sci-fi plot gets and Dawn of the Planet of the Apes takes the IP seriously. At the same time, much of the execution is contextually flawed. For example, the survival camp in San Francisco simply letting a national guard base and all it weapons sit nearby open to bandits or transient raiding parties until suddenly apes are an threat. That's a poor survival strategy. Another huge problem is the Ape learning curve is unrealistic. Assuming apes can fire weapons is fine. Having them assault a fortified position with those weapons and win is silly. The apes clearly charge an implacement on horseback with their fingers on the triggers. Guns run out of bullets and the apes don't reload. Even though they've never seen a cars controls, they can commandeer a tank. I like the power struggle aspect between the apes. I really liked the ploy of Koba acting playful to fool a couple of morons. But largely the battle and fall of the human was poorly executed. It could have worked well if the apes simply came down from the rooftops or infiltrated from other areas instead of a charge with guns (limitlessly) blazing. Otherwise, the movie was entertaining as a sci-fi diversion, but by no means epic or revolutionary.",

Mirroring foreign politics on the brink of war in real life, all of those same problems and confusions are represented here with a deeply human and moving film the result. Neither side is good, neither side is bad. Instead, it is one big shade of gray with plenty of confusion on both sides. The cinematography and score are once more incredible. The special effects are fantastic and the fight choreography incredibly impressive. Many modern day blockbusters lack weight and an air of importance and \"epicness\".

Is this a bad thing, no. in the grand scheme of film, I have found that the Oscars don't hold as much impact as they have in the past; and at the end of the day, Whether or not Serkis will be recognized by some over critical scholars should not impact Our love for an actor who love what he does and will continue to do what he loves.",
