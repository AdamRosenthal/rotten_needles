You won't find any Oscar performances here, just a roller coaster ride that carries enough twists and turns, ups and downs, to satisfy the thrill seeker in its intended audiences.  The best part, from a science standpoint, is that these aren't just mindless earthquakes but sequential seismic events that are all a part of the fault-line that so many people in the Western United States are watching closely for the biggest disaster moment of the last century.  Whether or not it will be quite THIS bad is anyone's guess, but San Andreas does a lot to walk through some of the scenarios that people might fact should something this horrific ever strike near home.

That weary chestnut is complimented by a bevy of equally \"original\" characters like cowardly rich guys; moronic youngster who fall in love within 5 seconds, and knowing scientists who take hours to start shouting \"Take cover\": This movie has everything you want in an utterly cliched movie and more. One of the most laughably bad scripts I've had to sit though in a long time.

At least if the effects in \"San Andreas\" were worth waiting out the doldrums, it might have made sitting through the movie worthwhile, but they weren't even that good. Just average computer bits showering down all over the place.  And you know the pace: SPFX -- talk -- SPFX -- talk --- and talk -- and talk. And what talk.

Once can only sit and scoff at the jello for lines the actors are given to work with. Even the mass of muscle known as The Rock looked weak and helpless about making this dog work. Even worse, it manages to make the smartest actor in Hollywood, Paul Giamatti look like an eyeball rolling puffin -- whose magical computer model predicts the end of the West Coast but doesn't tell him to at least put a call into a disaster agency to share the news.  Word to director: When you're filming the apocalypse, next time try not to shoot the whole thing in medium closeup -- just ready for that leap to TV where it belongs. Poor TV.",

I too was laughing out loud in many parts because the dialogue was so ridiculous and apathetically delivered.  It's like the actors didn't take their delivery of dialogue too seriously to save themselves the embarrassment of looking like they're trying to make it work.

I've been accurate on 12 of past 15 best pictue winners. Will usually read reviews before opting in on a theater visit, but on San Andreas i didnt. The Rock, action flic, plenty of popcorn CGI...honestly wasn't expecting much,but man was i wrong.....TOTALLY blown away!!! Best special effects EVER!  Best action & suspense EVER! Most surprising was how the director was able to let the  acting, script, and family backstory/lovestory trump the incredible action sequences!!!!  Much like the Deccaprio Winslet backstory in Titanic found a way to trump the ship's demise,  the character development, and outstanding acting found a way to do the same in San Andreas!!! No Titanic, but in my book....this one deserves a WHOLE lot more respect than it's getting!!!  SO SAD that with its poor critical reviews, this work of art will never receive its due rewards & accolades.....can anybody say..\"300\".  Lastly, if it had more blood, guts, foul language, and nudity???? I guarantee you'd be seeing rave reviews....that might be the saddest part of all.",

Pretty predictable if you ask me. Plus i just wasted this movie for you so you won't have to go buy it on DVD. From the trailers i though this was going to be good. Ugh looks can be deceiving.",

      "text": "San Andreas is a good disaster movie to watch, starring Dwayne Johnson, Alexandria Daddario, and Carla Gugino. The film is about the San Andreas fault line in California going off, triggering a 9.1 in Los Angeles, and a 9.6 in San Francisco. We also get a neat scene in which a 7.1 destroys the Hoover Dam in Nevada. The drama behind the film is Dwayne is estranged to Gugino, but is reunited with her when Daddario is trapped in San Francisco. The two make it from Los Angeles to San Francisco, by helicopter, by stealing a car in Bakersfield, to flying an airplane than a stranger near King City, California offered them for the stolen truck. I won't spoil the rest of the movie, but I will say that it is set in San Francisco for the remainder of the film. The special effects are top notch, possibly the best of any other disaster movie. From the tsunami wave going over the Golden Gate Bridge to the collapse of Los Angeles' AON Center, this film won't disappoint in that factor. However, the cheesy parts with Paul Giamatti brought the movie down to a 9/10. \"Who should we call?\" asks a CalTech student. \"Everybody\" whispers Giamatti. Hahaha. Great movie though!",
