Why does every filmmaker think he has to retell the origin story of the hero?  We never needed to see Indiana Jones' childhood to know that we were about to see another of his great adventures.  And just like John Williams nailed the score for Superman, Basil Poledouris nailed Conan's theme in the original movie.  It just isn't the same without it.  Jason does a passable job as Conan with as little as he was given to work with.  Just nothing new in the same old paternal vengeance motive.  There was never any Conan avenging his father/mother/fellow Cimmerians in any of Howard's work.  Just pure adventure.  Fight scenes were mostly well choreographed and with good blood and some gore thrown in.  And it wouldn't be a Hyborian Age movie without the topless women.  Thanks for that at least.

The supposed to be cool lines by Conan were supposed, i mean come on, I live, i love, i slay, i am contempt? Omg so dumb. Ron Perlman is a kicka$$ actor but why does he keep signing up for these dumb medieval films? The beginning of this movie was terrible and boring. The only reason i gave this movie a 4 is because the action was actually pretty damn good, whoever was in charge of the action in this film did a really good job but everything else was stupid, story was decent though, but i saw this movie for free because i work at a Regal theater so i cant complain too much, but overall this movie is a dumb fun film. Should be on the scifi channel but too graphic for television, oh and it definitely is #2 in my book for most awkward sex scene, only behind 300.

It didn't flow smoothly from scene to scene. Plot was weak and the writing was weaker. Even a lot of the action scenes were a big disappointment, because the view was mostly close-ups and you couldn't really see what was going on half the time.

I couldn't help but appreciate how much practical movie making (real sets, stunts, etc) there was in place of CG. Sure some of the locales were computer generated, but I found that these were done very well and it didn't detract from the experience. This was a fun adventure that I hope people discover later as a cult film. My only gripe with the film is the use of Morgan Freeman as a narrator that drops out halfway through. If there is a narrator, then they should bookend the film, closing it out. Also, Morgan Freeman's voice was not a good choice.",

Jason Momoa may look the part, but his over-confidence and exaggerated expressions come off as being silly instead of stern and powerful. There is no consistency whatsoever in the accents or dialects of the various groups of people that Conan encounters in his travels. The world of Hyboria is dramatically reduced as a result, especially considering how quickly Conan is able to travel from land to land in search of his betrayers. Most of the story and background are related by an unseen narrator, who quickly tries to piece things together for the audience in between the overblown action sequences. Zym is a bland and forgettable villain that would cower before James Earl Jones' Thulsa Doom. What is worse, the grand scheme that has taken him over 20 years of battling and searching to complete is spoiled in one brief and unsatisfying final conflict. This consists mostly of unbelievable feats and unnecessary computerization. The only entertainment comes from the absurd amount of bloodshed and heavy reliance on nude wenches. For mindless sword-fighting and mayhem, CONAN is a serviceable action flick, but in all other ways, it is utterly underwhelming. -Carl Manes",

      "text": "This film is an odd mixed bag. The plot is stupid. The dialogue, for the most part, isn't great. And all the actors, except maybe Ron Perlman, lack charisma in their roles. The pacing of the film is off. On the other hand the film is visually striking, action packed, and the sword combat is really original. The fighting is pretty good, and the gore factor is appropriate for the subject matter. The Conan stories don't have complex plots. They are more straightforward adventure stories and that is one of the nicer things about them. The plot of this film is 50% re-hash of the Arnold Schwartzenegger Conan the Barbarian film with a bunch of new stuff thrown in from the books. The result is awkward. Either commit to the reboot, or show us something completely different! There is something magical about the Arnie film. Its self aware how ridiculous it is, but doesn't let that get in the way. And Arnie's charisma shines through it all. This film is not bad, but a completely forgettable flick by comparison.",

I know Jason Momoa from HBO's Game of Thrones, so I figured it couldn't be too bad. Well, the 2011 remake of Conan the Barbarian is a film that tries desperately to be something it is not: more than just an action movie. Thanks to a dreadful script, it fails miserably.",
