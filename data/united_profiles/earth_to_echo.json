'Earth to Echo' was more of a snooze fest rather than a entertaining movie.",

The basic concept of making these boys last night memorable and the growth in thought they experience as it is happening is a positive influence.

Personally I enjoyed Earth to Echo and I loved how it was filmed from a first person perspective with the use of Tuck's camera. It made it feel unique and it wasn't too shaky like Cloverfield. The film aimed to highlight the importance of friendship and how this strong bond can sometimes be stretch to it's limits in tough circumstances. It defiantly got a lot of inspiration from Steven Spielberg with E.T. and Super 8 which made the film more engaging and familiar. Overall I highly recommend Earth to Echo to anyone you won't be as disappointed as the majority of the review say!",

But other than that is it still an okay movie, and that's mostly due to the great characters, solid plot and somewhat okay actors. Yes the plot isn't original by a long shot, but it's still works in its own way. The story is somewhat unique and there are some entertaining (but also boring) moments. But it doesn't feel that exciting as what it could have been. It started a bit slow but it ascalated greatly in the second and the third act. The aspect that really stands out in Earth To Echo is the cinematography, it's unique but somewhat shaky and annoying. But is it worth watching -- I would say that's it's a 50 % chance that you would find it okay, so it's up to you. But I wouldn't take those odds.",
