      "text": "Compliance is a small movie that's saying a lot more than some of the biggest, high budget films being released. It is psychologically driven and gives much insight into how and why an ordinary individual can be blindly driven to do unspeakable things, by those in the authority (or at least those they believe is an authority figure). It is filled with excellent, naturalistic performances (particularly from lead actress Ann Dowd), which were essential in keeping the viewers engaged in such minimalism. The movie is tense and the director slowly, yet appropriately eases us into the tension, one step at a time. Compliance is a very good piece of independent cinema that I highly recommend, and hope doesn't go unnoticed.",

Alot of people say that the characters are too stupid and the story is too ridiculous, and it might be but the movies accurately represent the events that it is based on (no matter how far fetched they might be). So you just need to accept that and then you will realize that this is a really well made movie. The whole movie has a really organic feel to it, the dialogue is genuine dialogue that you would hear in real life. The acting is really subtle, there is no over acting or stupid characters. I have to mention Ann Dowd who give a great performance and  Dreama Walker for actually taking on this role. And the direction is amazing, there is a tense feeling throughout the movie and the long shots give a dream like feeling to the movie. The only thing I didn't like was that the ending which was kind of rushed, if not for that it would have been a perfect movie (for what it is). 9.6/10.",

Director Craig Zobel and star Pat Healey (\"Officer Daniels\") addressed our audience, stressing that it's not the people who are worried that they might get caught up in this sort of situation that worry them - it's those people who see it as a black and white no-brainer that these employees are idiots who are likely the same people that would likely fall prey to this situation, or the Milgram experiments. I kept thinking about Clooney's line from Michael Clayton - \"Police don't call - they show up.\" As for the film, it's dramatic and interesting, but too much of the film is laser focused on the single night rather than on the post-call ramifications. I found it super interesting that the real-life Officer Daniels was acquitted of all charges - not in the film.",

      "text": "I want to start by saying that it would behoove a few of you to do some research regarding the film's claim \"based on true events\" that we see before the first frame.  Unfortunately for this movie, that claim has been perverted over the years, to the point where it hardly means anything.   It's gotten to the point where \"professional\" reviewers don't even bother researching the claim before saying slyly cynical things like \"According to the filmmakers, the events in the film were inspired by...\" That's from the Miami Herald, whose review of the film translated into a 25/100 on metacritic.  Compared to the \"based on true events\" claims that too many movies make, Compliance is a near verbatim account of a true story that happened in a McDonalds in Mount Washington, KY.  I'll provide naysayers with a link at the bottom of this review, to save you the two minutes of research it took me to find.  I have a problem with people being blatantly unwilling to look in the mirror, refusing to acknowledge that every single one of us has the capacity, under the right circumstances, to do awful things.  From what I've read, the negative reviews I've seen illustrate this kind of self-delusional ignorance.  These things happened.  As a film, Compliance is solid.  The acting is natural, and in some cases, beautifully harrowing.  The same can be said for the score.  For me, the restraint with which the filmmakers and actors treated such an explosive, horrifying situation served to create an unbelievable amount of tension.  As for the script, it's a very difficult feat to make the characters' actions and reactions seem plausible in a situation like this, especially when even our greatest minds have failed to understand just how the appearance of authority can make us do such awful things.  But it happened, and I think instead of faulting the filmmakers for \"creating\" \"stupid characters,\" we should adopt a more honest approach.  Spoiler alert  if you read this article, you will know everything that happened in the movie.
