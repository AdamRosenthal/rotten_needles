But there are some glaring problems with editing, Foley sound, acting, makeup and special effects.  The lead actor is absolutely terrible, but he is good looking and has a great physique.  Some of the supporting acting is fine or good, some of it is like a high school play.  The editing is so choppy and disjointed that one wonders who was overseeing the editor. There are moments of good special effects and makeup and moments when those technical elements are glaringly amateurish.  There clearly was too much money spent on custom body panels and a 60's style hood for the modified Camaro that looks like it is trying out for Transformers (and we are supposed to believe that it is the main character's great design), money that should have been spent on acting lessons, hiring a real editor and having a professional writer look at the script.  But Jinn is ultimately doomed by the vanity of the writer/director/editor/producer behind it.  He is so inept at most of the tasks that it is at times comical.  But because it was his money behind most of this, nobody dared tell the emperor that he was naked.",
