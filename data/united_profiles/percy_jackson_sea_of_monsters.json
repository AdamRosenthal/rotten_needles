      "text": "I had posted a more positive review before this, but now that my excitement has worn off i'm starting to notice a few more problems with this movie, even though I think it's a very good movie. This movie took what made the first movie good: the supporting cast and writing. The writing is pretty good in this movie, though the dialogue may not be the best, but it has jokes and humor that thankfully remind fans that this is Percy Jackson's type of humor. The supporting cast NAILS it as their characters; Mr. D, Hermes, The grey sisters, the supporting cast cameos manage to do so well in their roles. When it comes to an adaptation of a book, I think a movie can do well with it as long as it takes the basis plot, setting, and characters. This film manages to stay true to the book better than the first film, even if it isn't spot-on, though I feel that a few book elements are done a bit too early. if you've read the books, you'll notice what i'm talking about. i'm also glad that the director manages to stay true to the book a lot more, while also tying things with the first movie so that moviegoers who haven't read the book can still catch on. Considering the first film's bad accuracy, that's pretty hard to accomplish, and i'm glad the director managed to do it. My problems, however, are mainly two things; cgi and a certain plothole. The cgi, while colorful, isn't the best. It's very bland to me, but there has been better and worse cgi. Something I didn't understand is how exactly Luke, the main villain, managed to escape what happened at the end of the lightning thief. if there was an explanation, it didn't go into very good detail, unless I missed something. A noticeable issue i noticed after my excitement wore down is the acting and character development. The characters in the movie have little to no development, and each one is taken a bit as wooden. The acting, while okay, is a bit worse than the last film. I feel that the actors were trying to nail their characters in this movie, but just weren't there yet, if that makes sense. Finally, I feel that there were missed opportunities with fighting sequences. The bull fight was very well done, as was the fight on The Andromeda, but some I don't think utilized what it could do in the movie. for example, I feel that the fight against Charybdis could have been pulled off better, as with the fight against Polyphemus. Overall, Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters surprisingly lives up to my expectations. The writing and the supporting cast are much better this time, the accuracy towards the book is nice, even though a few things are done a bit too early, and even though the cgi and acting isn't the best, Percy Jackson is a great movie, one of 2013's best films in my opinion. If you liked the first film, you'll most likely like the second. if you didn't really liked the first film, this one may or may not be good to you, depending on your movie preferences. In the end, this is a rare case of a sequel doing better than its predecessor, and if the Titan's Curse movie does well, my faith in this film series will be restored.",

All of these smart moves make it frustrating when we get to the second half. Luke is reduced to a pathetic and easily beaten villain, the prophecy is poorly explained and handled, the Sea of Monsters is overwhelming despite the build up and title, and the way the climax would be handled it makes you wonder if the filmmakers remember they still have three more books. Nonetheless, this is an improvement over The Lightning Theif giving us something that is more true to the spirit of the book than the predecessor.

There are bad special effects and little participation for Stanley Tucci (as in Jack the Giant Slayer), Natthan Fillion (though that appears a little fun) and even Brandon Jackson (one of the principals in the saga of the novel). The good the plot is well suited to the book, that leaves you doubt the end and that makes you crave and see the 3 (or for those who are lazy to read the third book), the direction of Thor Freudenthal is better than Chris Columbus (although the latter is still the producer of the film).

      "text": "Overall, this movie is a total waste of time and money. It was so far fetched from the book I almost cried. The camp half  blood scenes were portrayed very well, however the movie just went downhill from there. There were so many little changes they could've made throughout the entire movie that would've pleased the book fans. For instance Grover was at camp tagging along on the quest when he should've been on his search for Pan. There is no encounter at Circe's island, and the siren scene is completely cut out  which was a major bonding point for Annabeth and Percy.  They didn't need need it though, because there relationship was already so overly-developed with her always crying on his shoulder, not being the brave, athletic, and smart girl she was in the book. The character Luke was ever present (even when he shouldn't have been). He reminded me of a weasel, popping up everywhere with his minuscule army, instead of the overwhelming one we read about in the book. Along with that Percy Jackson himself seemed almost shy, with a lack of witty retorts and remarks. Clarisse played her part well, with smart aleck and sarcastic comments yet she didn't look the part and had an attractive appearance instead of a rough and tough one. The only characters that truly fit their parts were Grover and Mr. D, who we barely saw at all. Aside from lacking character depth there was a strange encounter in the stomach of Scylla that does not appear at all in the book (again, how hard would it be to follow the actual storyline.) The biggest crash of the movie, though, is the fight scene with Kronos at the island of the fleece. First of all, Luke's army wasn't even supposed to appear on the island, not to mention how did they lug a giant golden sarcophagus  up this huge hill. (Spoiler alert! Don't read next line if you're gonna watch movie!) Then, worst of all Kronos actually rises  into his own fiery form, not even possessing Luke  which is a HUGE dramatic part of the series. Then, percy even manages to cast him back to his sarcophagus with one slash of his sword. In conclusion, this movie was a horrible wreck, and will leave the book lovers (and other fans) with a frustrated vibe.",

The movie just throws characters at you and tries to establish a relation between them and the story. It's ridiculous.
