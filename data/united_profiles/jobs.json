I\u2019m not quite familiar with the life of Steve Jobs but the story seemed to flow alright. Making a bio-pic may not have been the best course of action for the film as its story is stretched out. Rather than focus on a specific point in Jobs life (ex. working in his garage) the film shows a broad approach. On one end, this helps to show how far Jobs has come in certain areas going from nothing to a big celebrity but at the same time it means that none of these moments can be fleshed out a lot. The film is constantly jumping around causing jobs arc from jerk to megajerk to nice guy doesn\u2019t get fleshed out properly. The film feels long and empty because it covers so much yet there is no substance or heart to allow me to connect to Jobs\u2019 struggle. The film fails to flesh out Jobs as a character and at times it just feels like a cheap rip-off of The Social Network where a smart genius is a jerk pushing away people while climbing the ladder of success.  It feels like an Oscar wannabe at times with all the key moments guy struggling and lots of shouting clips that I\u2019m guessing the filmmakers thought could be used when Ashton Kutcher got the nomination he never received. It\u2019s a shame too considering how the filmmakers got a lot of actors that look like their real-life counter-parts, J.K. Simmons, and a relaxing guitar score; that isn\u2019t enough to cut though the film needs substance and heart and this film lacks it.

You may think that the story of the movie was already prepared, but the writers had to pick some events in Steve Job's life which were interesting. They did not do it too well. I would have preferred to have seen more about the later life of Steve Jobs, than him sitting in an office shouting at people. The writers obviously noticed how good Ashton Kutcher looked as old Steve Jobs and decided to give him as little screen time as possible. Also it was not made clear what year's things were taking place in. I'm not an expert on Steve Jobs so I have no idea what year he was born in (probably in the 50's), after watching the movie about his company. I still don't know. One of the things I did like was the soundtrack. There was some of The Beatles some of The Rolling Stones (I think) and it really gave the movie a vintage feel. I'm guessing that's when a lot of it took place because I had no idea what year it was most of the time. To be honest Jobs did not teach me much about Steve Jobs at all.

All I could think about while watching the movie was that I forgot my iPod at my parents house It really did nothing for me. I can see a demographic of people really enjoying this movie, I certainly wasn't one of them.",

I wasn't sold on Kutcher's performance and only saw him as Ashton the entire movie and not Steve.  Additionally, I felt they handled Jobs' growth as a person poorly as the movie jumped from point to point and any character development needed for the next scene was just conveniently there when the story arrived.  However, I really enjoyed Josh Gad as Wozniak, the soundtrack was great and I admire that they didn't sugarcoat the reality that Jobs had a reputation of being kind of a big meanie-head.  In the end, \"Jobs\" was a passable biopic about the man who created a company where people will wait in line for days to get a phone that is really no different from the previous one they waited in line for.",

Liked seeing Steve Job's humble beginnings.

It's a refreshing change from his usual roles and he does incredibly well in the role. It could have done with a bit less gloss and bit more substance - that's where it misses the mark most and that's not Ashton Kutcher's fault (I'm disappointed by how unfairly trashed he's been for this movie) - but it piqued my interest in its subject matter: a computer tycoon.
