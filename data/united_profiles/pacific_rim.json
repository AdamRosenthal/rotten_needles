Will the sequel come? That'll be something for Warner Bros. to decide, but if they want another hit, green light the sequel and let Del Toro do his thing. This movie more than makes up for the disaster horror movie he released earlier in the year, in \"Mama\". Nobody was expecting this to be what it has become, so its easily a major surprise. I wouldn't go so far as to say, \"best movie of the year\" (that, personally for me, still lies with \"The Place Beyond The Pines\").

All the actors play their characters fantastically, helping to really deliver the experience, such as Raleigh Becket's washed up pilot character type.

Yes I do like anime and kaiju films, but I only watch anime films now and I rarely see a kaiju film again now a days. So that tells you where I'm coming from. Anyways, Pacific does best what the other blockbusters do but aren't quite there yet. This film gives you all its got, there's no cliffhanger or any major loose ends; I do think man of steel is real close in that does world building, but that film is definitely getting a sequel. Back to Pacific rim, it gives very cool action sequences; the best being the Hong Kong battle, and tries to slow the action for the better. It is \"logical\" after all that giant creatures and mechs should move at this pace, so therefor the action is easy to follow even in the dark. So obviously the visuals is the high point, the middle ground is the cast. No one is terrible, or even bad; in fact Idris is the best actor in this film, but the scientist and Ron Perlman are a bit distracting. (Disclaimer: Ron Perlman is awesome). With the basic film critique out of the way, I can now just say what I liked and disliked; because I appreciate a film more when I can acknowledge its pros and cons. I liked the action, the design of the Jaegers and Kaijus, that characters aren't too sophisticated, and the sheer size of it makes it a masterpiece in eye candy. However, I disliked some of the characters; the scientists in particular and the jerk from Australia, that the Russian and Chinese Jaegers get the short strip and get defeated too quickly; I loved their designs the most, and some of the logic is either nonsensical or just plain silly.",

I didn't expect Japanese inspired Godzilla-esque scenes, where it was made from cardboard miniature and people in suit back in the old days, will be realized into hyper stylish modern day action movie. Granted, it's still marred by a few typical disaster movie cliches, but it will make your eyes open wide and mouth agape just seeing the colorful metal knight versus relentless organic behemoth as your childhood is relived once again.",

It was The Matrix, and it stands alone as a classic of the genre (Sequels?  WHAT sequels? *AHEM*)   Well, today I got to experience that giddy, geektastic sensation all over again.  Pacific Rim is a love letter to giant monster and anime fans the world over.  The story is nothing you haven't heard before  its us against an alien foe of unbelievable power.  Everything from Independence Day to Evangelion gets cherry picked for ideas, and some of the references feel like intentional nods to del Toro's sources of inspiration.   The acting is more than passable  particularly Elba's  and what little comedy relief there is comes mostly from secondary (but still important) characters played by extremely talented folks.  One of them is essentially a national caricature, but its still quite endearing.  I could go on and on about specifics but more eloquent voices than mine have already hit most of the high points.  The bottom line is that Pacific Rim and del Toro absolutely delivered.  This movie helped remove the awful taste left by Man of Steel and is in my opinion the first true summer \"event\" film worth seeing.  Oh, and ILM absolutely knocked it out of the park on the visuals.  You will believe a giant robot can fly (even if its being kicked across town by an angry monster).  Oh, and did I mention that the PG-13 is a *mild* PG-13?  Except for a very small amount of language with nary an f-bomb to be heard, this is a family-friendly movie.  It might scare a few of the younger kids but with the stuff on Cartoon Network these days its pretty unlikely.  See it.  See it again.  Reward this director/producer who probably had to call in every marker he had to get this film made.  There aren't even Pacific Rim toys in the stores around here.  Supposedly you can get them online and I assume in bigger cities, but that tells you something about how little regard the industry has for this kind of material in live-action form.  My fear now is that the film, which has a nicely wrapped-up ending, will do well enough that the studio will demand a sexed-up sequel.  If that happens and del Toro resists they'll push him aside.  Should this come to pass, nerds the world over should grab their torches and pitchforks.",

However, the best part is that this film understand and get's what it its. It isn't afraid to admit what it is, and how essentially ridiculous the premise is, so unlike most movies it doesn't waste most of it's time trying to explain how it isn't what it really is, and dedicates it's resources to amazing fights and great character moments. Half of this film is just straight up monster battles. I'm giving this a 10/10 not because I think it is one of the best movies ever made or anything like that, but because I honestly can't think of a single way to improve this movie.",

      "text": "Pacific Rim, WOW? At first, the Jaegers seem like the perfect deterrent for the Kaiju menace; but when the monsters start getting smarter and deadlier  and Jaegers begin falling quicker than they can be rebuilt  mankind finds itself on the brink of extinction. Our last hope lies with the desperate plan of Marshall Stacker Pentecost (Idris Elba) and his handful of remaining Jaeger pilots, including war-worn veteran  Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) and rookie Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi), an unlikely pair who may prove to be the best pilot team the world has ever seen. We can make this short and easy: If the spectacle of big robots battling it out with big monsters is all you\u2019re interested in, then Pacific Rim is going to be a five-star experience that you should wholly enjoy in the biggest IMAX 3D theater you can find (earplugs recommended). However, if you require a deeper story and mythos to sell you on all the spectacle? You will get plenty of mythos, but despite a parade of \u201ccool moments,\u201d a mishandled central storyline ultimately makes the experience a hollow one. Director Guillermo del Toro is known for his wonderful imagination and abilities as a filmmaker  demonstrated in  signature works like Pan\u2019s Labyrinth and the Hellboy movies  and Pacific Rim is alive and crackling with some of his best work. From the robot and monster designs, to the well-staged battle sequences and overall concept, Pacific Rim is something uniquely its own within the crowded genre of summer blockbusters. Best of all, there\u2019s a pervading sense of fun and  joy that the director has infused his passion project with; the goal is to entertain and entertain it does, for the most part (it does get cartoony, but that cartoon is still pretty fun). On the downside, there are plenty of moments that will indeed seem less like homages and more derivative copy of other films not necessarily even related to the \u201cKaiju/Mecha\u201d sub-genre. See if you can catch those Independence Day and/or Deep Blue Sea moments and you\u2019ll know the sort of \u201cborrowing\u201d I\u2019m referring to. The script  co-written by del Toro and Clash of the Titans scribe Travis Beacham  is not impressive. The story is straightforward enough, but an abundance of sub-plots often makes it feel scattered-brained. The emotional core and character development are even more unfocused: this is supposedly Raleigh and Mako\u2019s story we are being told  and Hunnam and Kikuchi are both solid leads with solid chemistry  but beyond a couple of superficial dramatic moments, there is no real conflict between our central characters, and no real arc for them to complete as individual characters. In short: our protagonists are often the least interesting parts of the film, which inevitably means a sort of detached viewing experience. Oddly enough it is Idris Elba\u2019s Stacker Pentecost who is the most dynamic character in Pacific Rim, and seems to get the most complete and engaging character arc of the whole ensemble. Elba (by now well established for his talent to stand out even in bit roles  see: Prometheus or Thor) walks away owning every one of the many scenes he\u2019s in  which is great for him, but is also clear indication that the writers are not driving the story with full control of the wheel. The sound design is awesome  and by awesome I mean very, very, loud. Actual dialogue sometimes had a cavernous echo to it that made it hard to make out  but whether that was just my theater or the movie itself, I can\u2019t say for sure. This is definitely an IMAX experience to be had; but the post-converted 3D, while very well done, doesn\u2019t feel as necessary. A 2D IMAX experience would be more than sufficient  but if you are a big fan of the robot/monster stuff, the extra splurging will be worth it to you. On the whole, Pacific Rim has its creator to thank for elevating it above so many similar and forgettable action blockbusters, through sheer creativity, love and force of will. While the storyline and emotional core aren\u2019t strong, the action and spectacle are, and del Toro builds his world well enough to create plenty of future opportunities for re-visits, spin-offs, multi-media projects and everything else fans (and movie studios) love in a good fanboy franchise.",

It sounded like a bit of fun beforehand, but in the end, I just found it noisy, too repetitive and a bit unrewarding. Script, characterisation and dialogue are strictly for kiddies, and the 3D was nothing special either. As an Australian, I have to say I laughed a bit at the stereotyping of the Aussie jaegermeisters  who were basically portrayed as borderline psychotics with vague homoerotic issues  issues that they simply couldn't articulate except through tongue tied rage and interpersonal violence.  Though, come to think of it, pretty well all the jaegermeisters fell into that category. I suppose tearing the heads off giant lizards that don't say anything does require a certain psychological predisposition towards random violence.  Anyway, just a popcorn movie (largely aimed at the Asian market).  I hope Del Toro does well out of it  but he is a much, much better director than this movie would indicate to the casual viewer.",

When a portal opens under the Pacific Ocean and monsters begin flooding through it, humanity creates giant mechs to fight them but when this tactic begins to fail, humanity devise one last ditch effort to destroy the portal for good. Pacific Rim knows what it is and it does play to its strengths but those strengths are only really one strength, its visuals and the near perfect CGI incorporated into the movie. Don't get me wrong, the 3D is redundant and really makes watching the film difficult but in 2D Pacific Rim is terrific to look at with Director Guillermo Del Toro really understanding how to frame his action as to show the scale and wonder these mechs (refereed to as Jaegers) and monsters (Kaijus) evoke. It;s the best aspect of the movie which means the action light 2nd act is thoroughly monotonous and often times meaningless. The plot is generic which is surprising considering the films interesting premise. The writing is equally predictable with emotional scenes failing to leave a mark because they feel reused. It's a well acted film and Idris Elba continues to prove he is a gifted actor who can display many emotions at once but he is stuck with scowl inducing dialogue that is hard to swallow. Charlie Hunam is an interesting choice for the hero and while his sullen yet worldly performance as Raleigh is good it isn't great and his casting feels safe when Pacific Rim is an out there premise and film. Ultimately the film needs to take more risks in its endeavour to surprise viewers and it feels like Del Toro took a step back and played it a little too safe.",

It's illogical and predictable, the characters are stereotyped and sometimes outright annoying (say, the two scientists). Normally I try not to think about the plot too much during such blockbusters, but again, in the Pacific Rim there is just too much screentime devoted to it. To compare, the recent Man of Steel also didn't boast an exactly flawless plot, but action was neatly mixed with the story, a major scene ocurring every 10 minutes or so.

At every turn, the effects never ceased to impress me and really was a treat to watch. The film had to have been truly impressive in 3D. That said, the film does have problems. It can be a little over-the-top and the script is sketchy at best. Some of it is well-written, but far too many of them was just not well done. Charlie Day's character can be quite annoying, largely because Day has no sense of nuance and has an annoying voice in his own right, but here, it is not reigned in. Plus, it feels totally out of place in a film that is otherwise quite serious. If it were a comedy, Charlie Day would have been appropriate pick, but not here. The acting is fine, though can be a little hammy at times and I would certainly stop short of calling it good. Fortunately, the film is fun, has an important message of togetherness to communicate, and has truly incredible special effects. Far from perfect, Pacific Rim is still a fun summer romp.",

The downside to this movie is almost every character in this movie is a walking cliche and the plot really drops the ball in explaining the Kaiju's purpose for coming to Earth and the UN makes some pretty stupid decisions along the way.

But I what I wasnt expecting was how good the story and writing was. Lets face it, in terms of story all this film needed was a loose thread to string the action sequences together and honestly I would've been content with that. But it's actually surprisingly deep and does a good job of making the audience feel more connected to the characters, who are also pretty engaging. Pacific Rim doesn't make the same mistake transformers made where the human characters are so dull and irritating that every time there's a scene focused on them you just want it to be over so you can get back to the cool stuff. They actually have a good deal of personality and help progress the whole thing nicely.",

The special effects and visual design are simply masterful; the Jaegers look exactly how a giant robotic mech suit should, their interfaces look suitably futuristic and cool, while on the other end the Kaiju look suitably otherworldly, but with enough grounding to not look out of place in our world. On the story end of things, you have a surprisingly intricate tale of multiple characters who each have personal struggles relating to the Kaiju invasion and subsequent advent of Jaegers, as well as even minor characters generally being at worst interesting and entertaining and at best well-developed and multidimensional. It's also simply astounding just how well this movie built its world, with every environment feeling exactly how it should and fitting into the rest of the setting very impressively. Certain flashback scenes which I won't spoil were simply a joy to watch, masterful displays of cinematography at its absolute best, and the rest of the movie isn't far behind them.

Those cynical of the premise, though, may find themselves somewhat interested that director Guillermo del Toro is bringing his signature flourish to \"Pacific Rim,\" an ode to Japanese monster cinema. Kaiju originates as a Japanese word roughly translating as \u201cstrange monster,\u201d but more pertinently here, Kaiju is the name for this entire genre of sci-fi, where massive creatures step on buildings and threaten to destroy civilization.",

Fights between the kaju and yagers are huge, meticulously detailed, and about as far fetched as you can get.  It's entertaining to say the least, but I wish Del Toro had gone in for a more realistic approach.  I'm not saying that it doesn't look real.  It does look very real, but the style is cartoonish and outlandish.  There are real artistic flourishes here in small bursts, and the supporting characters are also reasonably enjoyable, especially Charlie Day, but the movie is still only a small fragment of what could have been.  The actor in the leading role gives an unconvincing and clich\u00e9d performance, and the screenplay only occasionally hints at anything truly intellectual.

Much of it actually seems to be ripped from earlier science fiction movies like Independence Day.  Some of the plot elements (dual pilots, which they break in their own cannon right off the bat) seem to be there simply as an excuse to create drama or a love story, neither of which are compelling in their own right.  With a little more polish on the characters or at least a few more memorable performances the movie could have been much stronger.

Guillermo Del Toro gives the Kaiju sub-genre a sloppy wet kiss (in spectacular fashion) in this sci-fi monster movie. From Godzilla to Gundam Wing, the spirit of Japanese monster and mecha fiction flows through this movie like a breath of fresh air (or torrential rains), without it losing its sense of originality. Destructive monsters, known as Kaijus, have emerged from an interdimensional portal on the floor of the Pacific Ocean. In resistance, the humans have developed giant robots, called Jaegers, which are piloted by two or more individuals in order share the mental load of operating such large, complex machinery. This leads to the drift, a brilliant concept, and the means by which the pilots \u2018mind meld\u2019 (so to speak) to operate the mechas together, and potentially do more. Set many years into this war, Del Toro constructs a world that feels lived in and the designs for the kaijus and jaegers were truly brilliant. Any attempt he makes to develop his characters (which is for the most part successful in my opinion) is a bonus for this spectacle. And what a spectacle it was\u2026 I haven\u2019t been this awestruck by big, loud, action scenes in a while. These sensational battle sequences wouldn't have been possible without the bombastic visual effect and sound mix; and not to mention the exceptionally creative, and dangerous sound designs. Yes, it may have only skimmed the surface of some its dramatic potential, but I went into this for a good time, and I got something inventive and visually spectacular as well.

The music Are great the ambiance is there the special effect  close to perfection the rhythm of the movie is really great no boring part or almost.   The Actors/actress Deliver really well.  I could listen the movie 3 times in the same week and not get bored.  A must see movie. It has is place in my collection with Aliens, Predator any science fiction fan must see this and its way better than transformers 2 and 3.",

The action is backed up by the storyline very nicely. And I thought the casting was very good too. Quite a bit of people don't agree. But I loved all the characters.

A lot of the bad reviews stem from people bashing the movie due to its week story. The story is not what makes this movie great and in my opinion shouldn't be too harshly criticized. Instead of trying to make a riveting story about something so ridiculous as giant man-made robots fighting aliens from beneath the ocean/another dimension, the people behind \"Pacific Rim\" decided to just go with a cliche plot and story. Not just cliche though, but cheesey. They sprinkled on the ricotta and sprinkled it with cheddar. It seems as if they knew what they wanted to do and just did it without over-thinking, and that's how a movie like this should be made. The action scenes where over-the-top and fun as hell to watch. The whole movie featured top-notch computer graphics that made everything come to life and made the whole movie compelling to watch. The acting was pretty good. Despite the cheeseyness there wasn't any real over-acting or any complaints in that department. One area this movie does not disappoint in whatsoever is the badassery of it all.

We are informed that deep beneath the Pacific Ocean a rift through time and space opened up and gigantic creatures named Kaiju began to emerge from the ocean's depths. The Kaiju begin began to attack populated areas and from the start it appears that mankind does not stand a chance against these terrible creatures. In response the countries of the world pool their resources and create giant mechanical robots to fight against the Kaiju. These robots known as Jaegers are controlled by two pilots who fuse their neural centrals so that they can share the mental load that is needed to control the Jaegers. But as the war continues on for over ten years, the Jaegers begin to lose and the Kaiju are only becoming stronger. Former pilot Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) is called back into the Jaeger program for a last attempt to take out the Kaiju by the four remaining Jaegers. And if they fail their objective, it will mean the end of human race. But there is much about the Kaiju that humans still do not know.",

There are scenes where the connection between the two does not really make sense unless there was a bigger romantic arc between the two of them that was cut in favor of more kaiju scenes.

      "text": "Pacific Rim the best summer movie ever made. It even fits the definition of a exploding summer blockbuster film which knows what it's doing. Pacific Rim also knows how to be one by not getting you bored while these titans fight in our cities. One side is made out of metal and the other is completely organic. Giant 250ft tall mechanical beings fighting equally 250 or 300 feet monsters is just something that has never been done before in a long time and it's all thanks to Guillermo Del Toro for pulling the drawings of giant robots and monsters out of my head, and finally putting them into a movie! This is the only movie by far, which has action on a scale that is physically unimaginable. And what's so great about this movie as well, is not only the action, there's a really great sense of humanity in this movie. That we haven't got in a long time too. Great characters and each shows a great purpose in their roles. Charlie Hunnam, I will agree his accent is a little wonky at times. But that's not enough to bring down on how big his charisma is in the movie. A really badass likable character. Though what I wished was more character development between him and his lost brother. It's sad, we didn't get that. But still, Charlie makes the heck out of the movie. Idris Elba, the actor known for playing Heimdall in Thor, is an amazing actor. That focus, and moral center of the movie, is what defines Idris' character.  Rinko Kikuchi, an actress who has less knowledge of an eye candy, yet to nail her role in playing the role of an isolated beautiful object in this movie and has really a great backstory. But she's just as good as Charlie's character, who has a badass backstory but it's a little one-dimensional. Charlie Day, from It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, is hilarious in this movie. Every scene he's in is appropriate for the comedic relieves and he's the scientist who's always hyperactive on drugs, especially the Hong Kong scenes where he's in. Great! Ron Perlman, known for making his cameo longer than any cameos I've seen, does a great job as a leader of a black market Kaiju dealer. Really great. Guillermo specifically said he wanted something that looked weirder or stranger than the giant monsters, so we got this. Something to be taken with the opposite of serious. And the rest of the cast did a fine job at bringing the movie with the sense of actual continuity. Pacific Rim definitely deserves a sequel as there's so much more of it's story that we needed. And the sequel should also tell more of the prologue which is quite short in this movie, unfortunately. Not giving audiences more information and therefore having others to felt like this movie had some part of the plot that didn't make sense. But I wasn't one of them. I know everything there is to know about Pacific Rim. Now I've said this and I will say it again, Pacific Rim is not just everything about explosions and spectacle and metal and monsters fighting, it has really great human elements in this movie. Unlike the Transformers which has some really inappropriate moments that just tore the film down and it's annoying. The action in there was really subtle, meaning it's bad and it's really hard to understand which transformer is fighting which transformer. Michael Bay and Dreamworks, you got some mess to do. Okay! So overall, Pacific Rim is an awesome great action summer blockbuster movie that deserves to receive all your money and it's really worth most of our time. Really dates back to the mecha and kaiju sub-genres in the past and now it's been revived. Thank you Guillermo Del Toro and the rest of his crew for making this entire movie possible. Thank you. Can't wait for it's sequel which is in storywriting process now! XD",

I know we should care about the characters and everything, but even with all this time spent with them, I couldn't care less about whether they lived or died. The main character is so bland that I can't even remember his name (or really anything he does) and his love interest is just as bland (though at least they tried to give her a backstory). Idris Elba's character was the only one who had any personality. Even the Robot-Monster fights occupy about 15 minutes of the running time and are mostly done in darkness. This is disapointing, since Guillermo Del Toro is such a great director, and this film should have been so much better. Instead, it begs unfortunate comparisons to Michael Bay's \"Transformers\" series. If you're fine with there being more uncompelling human \"drama\" (if it can even be called that) than the action they promised us, then good for you. Otherwise, I can't recommend this. 3/10.",

      "text": "Sparkly, frenetic, cartoonish and gory, Pacific Rim delivers a hyperbolically epic one-two punch of \"I could care less\". Pacific Rim makes Independence Day look like Saving Private Ryan by comparison. Half the monsters are carbon copy Balrogs ,courtesy of Kiwi animation shop WETA, and screenwriter Beacham shamelessly cribs scenes and plot devices from Star Wars, Chinatown, Top Gun, Lord of the Rings, and Crimson Tide. What little humanity this film exhibits is cliched and awkward, actually slowing the film's tedious pace. Wait till it hits one of the broadcast networks and fast forward through the shlocky parts on your DVR.",

So in the grand scheme, that is more than enought to have a good time, and have a good movie, but it doesn't make it go up the notch into grater levels, mostly because the story, the characters, and the conclusion of it is just what you would expect of a movie like this, epic speech by the leader before the final mission included. So all in all, a good and fun movie, and if you like giant robots, this is just right for you, but does it go into the great o excellent territories? Not so much.",
