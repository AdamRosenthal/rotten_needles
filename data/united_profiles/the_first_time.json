The talented and sexy Britt Robertson and Molly C Quinn. Then there is a young Aussie actor of considerable talent, James Frecheville who starred in the amazing 'Animal Kingdom'. Being a red blooded male I used to watch 'The Secret Circle' (hey, what's wrong with that?? lol) so Britt was plenty enough reason to see this. I actually recognised a lot of the actors in this well written movie. Another reason to see this was the fact that writer/director Jon Kasdan's previous film was the wonderful 'The Land Of Woman' so I was keen to see if he was truly following in his very famous director fathers footsteps. Father, Lawrence is behind some of the biggest films in Hollywood, such as, 'Return of the Jedi', 'Wyatt Earp' and 'Dreamcatcher'. He has his fathers touch.",

Their chemistry is outstanding and obviously the moments where the two are together are the highlights of the film. The fact that these characters are high school kids are both its rise and its downfall. The young characters make this more of a teen movie than anything but their innocence is also what makes the film unique. These characters go through some problems that a lot of young people have when falling in love for the first time.. There are so many cute moments throughout this movie. It's unfortunately pretty clich\u00e9d though, but it is still plain to see that both Brit Robertson and Dylan O'Brien were bound to become stars.",
