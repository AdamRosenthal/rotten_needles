Every scene goes the way you think it will, and nothing works.  The dialog contains such witticisms as, \"Nice job Pearson, you dummy!\" from one of Scott's teammates, and, \"I'm gonna break your neck, Backwater!\" from a member of the rival team--\"Backwater\" being the clever term used by insiders and outsiders alike for the small town of Coldwater.  The actors struggle with stage direction; I always felt conscious of the players hitting their marks and delivering their awkward lines; nothing comes off as natural.  It doesn't help that the actors, especially Presley, are too old to play high school kids.  Full review on my blog.",
