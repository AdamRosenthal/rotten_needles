Totally unbelievable and Stephanie 's family were not funny and the books are laugh out loud funny. The story had no substance and I was bored within the first 5 minutes. Very disappointed...",

I'd vote 15 if I could, perhaps the critics are used to being paid off and the folks behind this failed to pay the toll. Interesting that last I looked it was #3 in $ at the box office,while running single digits in critical reviews. Maybe we need some critics with their finger on the pulse of movie viewers. Vote with your wallet, just go see it.",

It probably was if my mom liked it because she usually hates going to the movie theater so i think it would be a good movie to take your mom to little sister or family just don't take a dude because it might just raise some questions of your sexuality if you take a guy to the movie theater and your a guy.

      "text": "A horribly inept comedy featuring a miscast Heigl in a performance that could be a big contender for a Razzie award next year, One for the Money is just flat out bad. It is unfunny throughout, save for the brief appearance of Leonardo Nam as a zany stoner, and Heigl tries to put on a Brooklyn accent that seems to disappear and reappear at random. The characters, apparently drawn from a popular series of crime novels, are one dimensional and if you aren't already familiar with them (I wasn't) they might come off as stock characters. Ultimately, it seems odd that all of the glitter and polish of mainstream releases could produce something so ordinary and unappealing, even at this level. One for the Money has nothing going for it. It's just another Heigl vehicle, but even those other lackluster films have something distinctive about them.",

A better budget is always nice too, the transition from evening to night is pretty jarring at the end going from boat to truck.  Otherwise it was sweet, fun, and entertaining.  Perhaps a good movie put together by a lot of women is a scary vision of the future for critics?  Dunno.",
