This is a spectacular film though, and the writing is superb. I thought it was so intriguing, and beautiful, and I really appreciated the bits of surrealism that were there. This is like a cinematic/visual poem, (which is also what her debut was), so I understand its not being for everyone. I found it pretty remarkable though. Miranda July is very possibly my favorite modern filmmaker.",

      "text": "This is one unusual film. I stayed with it, was a little tossed about, lost my sense of time, and was a little confused. It's made up of  documentary, reality, fantasy, science fiction, performance art. I very much was enthralled by Ms July and Mr Linklater and had to see where they were going. I had much distaste for Mr Warshofsky's character but perhaps i was supposed to. At first I thought I might just fast forward just to see what happens. But the characters moved me. I'm not sure how I really feel only watching it once, but I think it's worth a screening so it receives my lowest recommended rating B-, a 6 here.",

I haven't been watching as many movies as I used to but damn this has to be one of the weirdest movies of the past few years. The first half has kind of boring dialogue that sorta seem to drag one but, in my opinion, this movie makes up for it in just a 5 minute part or so.  I don't want to ruin anything but the part when he actually stops time, that affected me more than anything else in this movie. Overall super strange and I'm not sure why some of the things happened in the movie but it was definitely interesting to say the least.",

I strongly feel that the whole issue of cats in shelters in America (and lets face it its a huge issue) was completely trivialised.  I mean what was the point?  Why would a director focus so much on the wait that this cat had?  The same wait that thousands of cats have every day.  Quite frankly I was sickened by this film.",
