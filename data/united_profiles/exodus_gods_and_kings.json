And what is the negative effect of a movie like this? Well, it's a waste of time and energy making it if it is made for the glory of the world and money and not for the glory of God.

It may actually be the worst movie I've ever seen in my entire life, because I left the theatre 2/3 the way through out of disgust. We need to ask God the Father for movies like \"Passion of the Christ\" and \"Gospel of John\" which are amazing movies made for God's glory and honor.   I mean, come on, the mention of God is so missing in this movie, you'd be surprised at the end of the movie if Israel even had a God.

Unfortunately, I get the impression that the movie had several scenes cut for commercial purposes. What makes the Moses story so captivating is that it's about a love-hate relationship between two brothers, an aspect that wasn't explored with much depth. I never felt Moses and Ramses grew up together since they always acted like enemies when they were in each other's presence. The latter being portrayed as a one-dimensional cartoon villain doesn't help much to the cause either. The characters' motivations don't always make sense (E.g: Moses claims to care about the Egyptians, yet he orders his men to burn their food supplies), and their development is rushed (E.g: Moses accepts his fate as a prophet too easily).",

      "text": "This movie starts trying to explain the strong brotherhood between Moses and Ramesses. It somewhat succeeds because it only shows one scene when their father is saying keep eachother safe, always. I never felt that bond between Moses and Ramesses because they only liked eachother for one small scene and hated eachother for the rest of the movie. But when they form a rivalry, it turns into a strong hatred and that part is awesome. Especially the \"battle scene\" at the end when Moses \"parts\" the Red Sea and the huge wave engulfs the entire Egyptian army and somehow by some magical coincidence, Ramesses survives. Perhaps god spared him so he could feel guilty? Also, the movie has a ton of pacing issues! The beginning drags on and on and the end drags as well. The middle sequence is the best because their is a smooth transition between events. The part that drags the most is when Moses forms a family. I did not care about his wife and his child and I actually wanted them to die so the movie can move on. But, eventually it did and the 1 hr segment in the middle is awesome. It shows the conflicts in egypt as Ramesses becomes power hungry and tries to find Moses who is hiding in Egypt, training his small army so he can free the hebrew slaves and again, the big battle in the end and the awesome battle scene at the beginning of the movie. All in all, Exodus is a good film but has a lot of pacing issues and lacks some character development. Exodus gets a 7/10 (good).",

At the time of this review the user review section was just littered with 1's and 2's, resulting in an incredibly low user score of 1.9! That's lower than the Star Wars prequels! Yeah that's messed up, and it's all probably butt hurt Ridley Scott fan boys raging because of Prometheus. The first half of this film, for me was the best. We have these two very strong brother characters; Moses played by Christian Bale and Ramses played by Joel Edgerson. The brilliant aspect is that the two clearly have conflicting ideologies, yet still love and respect each other. It adds this additional tension to every scene the two share, as your constantly wondering if an argument will erupt, but you don't that to happen because the movie does such a good job of establishing their friendship. Helping this are great performances from both, fleshing them out and making them more believable. This especially the case for Moses, which is the best aspect of this film. He's this really good, wise man who you can really root for, yet isn't some paragon of virtue that will always do the right thing. For example, initially Moses doesn't want to unleash the plagues on Egypt, as he thinks he will take more lives than he will save, which is what any normal person would think. In addition to this, Ramses is also extremely believable. Even though he seems incredibly bratty and whiny, but by the end you can relate to him. He's a good person, but is fed up of things not being perfect for him, something we've all felt at some point. Despite this, the over all narrative is incredibly generic, and does absolutely nothing to make this classic tale original, and is full of under devolved and cliche characters (apart from Ramses and Moses). Ramses father, for example, is just a huge douche bag with no real explanation of why he's like this. Also we never connect to the people Moses is trying to save, making us care more about Moses safety more than him saving everyone else. But the most disappointing part of this movie comes when it reaches the half way mark. When your expecting all that tension to just come out in a beautifully done peace of emotional drama, it decides to rush through it. Basically, it comes down to, Ramses father banishes Moses, he dies, Ramses is now in charge and is douche. Why? We don't know! It just skips on and suddenly he's his dad! I was expecting a scene where the two argue and we see their friendship being torn apart through dialogue. Now the third act could have saved the movie. As mentioned before, Moses's dilemma is extremely compelling and is so interesting. Because of this though, it kind of makes God look like the villain here. He's brashly making this decision to potentially wipe out thousands and isn't even taking into account that he might wipe out his own people in process. But the plagues! Oh my god the plagues look amazing! One of the best parts of this film is just the grand scale of Egypt and how cool it looks. And when the plagues come down it just destroys everything and it looks awesome! Their vile and disgusting, yet look really realistic. If this where to happen in real life, this is how it would look. It mixes everything to amazing CGI to excellent audio to make an immersive experience. Unfortunately, the ending is a huge let down. The parting of the Red Sea is no where near as awe inspiring or grand as it should. Worsening the taste of this last morsel is the fact that the CGI takes a big turn around. The sea looked like a darker version of the Elder Scrolls Oblivion water! Did they run out of budget? And that's it! No ending, no finally face of between the two brothers, just done. In the end Exodus ends up being a let down, yet still a great emotional drama (at least in the first half) and an entertaining watch.",

Christian Bale was all wrong for the part of Moses as was the other actors and actresses in this movie. It was hard to believe or get in to the mood set off by the storyline because the body language didn't quite meet up. The visual effects sucked when it came to depicting the river of blood and the the parting of the ocean. It was as though Ridley Scott was trying too hard to make both of these marvels logical in some way when it was supposed to be a Divine Miracle. The only thing I could say in Ridley's defense is that there isn't a description of God identity in the bible so he figured god can appear in any form he pleased but why a little boy? It makes no sense. Why would a general listen to what a little boy. Other than one little tid-bit I can't say anything positive about this movie. But the two thing I disliked the most about this movie is the false representation of the theatrical trailers. In the trailers it was made out to be an action packed movie when it actually was a very slow movie because almost nothing made any sense, And the part where the kid depicted as God came off to be immature as he was a kid and full of hatred when god time and time again is described as all forgiving. This makes me wonder if the bible was used as a reference at all in this movie.",

The previews show promise for both religious types and epic action types and so i was intrigued. Because of this being a biblical story, you take a gamble no matter what. So many different faiths to judge one film is going to turn into a blood bath no matter how you approach. So, I went to see this because i was curious, and I was not nearly as disappointed with this as I was with another biblical movie called, Noah. Sure, since these are Hollywood productions a solid overall likable bible story is quite a bit to ask. But a lot of work and effort was put into this film. The scale and grandeur was magnificent. Each costume and each city had a different style and detail to it that characterized the story. The dialogue and acting was sharp on most areas. I thought Ramses was played flawlessly. I liked how they put Moses in a military position because upon assumption you see Moses as a hardened general who becomes a humble prophet which proves for a good story. I thought the movie went well until Moses and God...or at least what was meant to represent God, meet. Things start to get weird and shaky for Christian Bale's portrayal of Moses. He seems lost and unsure of himself, as if God isn't helping him and it angers him and you lose touch with the love and care Moses and God are meant to have. Therein lies the failures of the movie. If you read the bible account of Exodus verse by verse you will find not many details and specifics of Moses' life and activities. This movie had its own vision about how to fill in the blanks. Although they did straight up abandon the bible account on several things, there is still the violent and brutal tone the Old Testament had. Each plague makes your skin crawl and makes you shiver. The delivery on the suffering of Egypt is very well done. Again, the Moses-to-God relationship is the one big pitfall. I thought the relationship portrayed in The Prince of Egypt was more appropriate than what they did here. Your faith doesn't have to suffer if you don't want it to, this movie may have been grueling and violent and strayed from convention a bit but i think the title of the movie best describes what the main idea was for them. Making a movie out of a very famous bible story and highlighting the divide between a King ( in this case Pharaoh)  and a God ( in this case the God of the Hebrews). This story tells of God's wrath upon those who believed in slavery and oppression and how a belief in God can overcome an Empire and a king. (much less blasphemous than Noah) This movie could have been great but it fell short. The project in general is so large and detailed and attempting to make it happen is hard at best. The large scale and huge spectrum took away from the importance of Moses and his journey and failed to center in on him as much as it should have. There are merits though. I say its worth at least one try.",

You know i was really hoping this movie was going to be great the trailers had shades of \"Gladiator\" in them and it made me hopeful that this wouldn't be like his last films but sadly i was wrong. The acting was decent but could have been better not because a lack of effort from the actors which i really liked for the most part but from the lack of a good script so the actors never really got a chance to show off their acting skills. Now just like his previous films \"Robin Hood and Prometheus\" they too lacked a good story but succeeded in effects this too looks like it falls into that category of his movies. Seeing the great plagues being brought upon the land of Egypt was awesome and was actually better than what i thought it was going to be so that does make up for its script but just a little bit.",

Moses and Aaron talked to Pharaoh, threw a staff on the ground that turned into a snake to prove they had God on their side AND THEN the 10 plagues began. 5) The Red Sea was Parted meaning that water was in the air not no water at all!!! 6) after the Israelite's  crossed the sea the waves fell upon all the Egyptians and killed all of them even Ramses. So in all I think that it would've been easier to make this movie more historically accurate rather than piss a bunch of people off.

      "text": "I've seen many incarnations of the Moses story, Exodus is just weak. Exodus is very sluggish at times the story comes to a pause with some long and boring scenes that serve no purpose, and a lot of inaccuracies Moses never got married and had children. And overall just weak scenes, the scene with the burning bush and \"god\" comes to speak to him Moses has never heard of God at this point and he asks the child \"Who are you?\" child God answers \"I am\" then the scene closes, how does \"I am\" explain to Moses who God is? Then afterwards Moses magically knows everything about God, to anyone that's never heard of God \"I am\" is far from helpful. Now another useless God scene with the child comes along again, why are they screaming at each other for no reason? Very useless dialog then the scene closes, then the movie jumps to the painting of the blood on the doorways, how did Moses receive these instructions when child God never told him to do it?",
