The original was mean spirited, low-brow, over-the-top and at times, obnoxious. Why critics are using these things as points AGAINST this sequel is mind-boggling to me. Dumb and Dumber To is the sequel that the franchise deserved. It may not be nearly as good as the original but it is leaps and bounds better than Dumb and Dumberer, which is all any true fan could ask for. If you're hesitant to see the movie because of average reviews, ask yourself if the original film holds a place in your heart. If it does, get yourself to the theatre and expect to laugh from beginning to end.",

Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels reprise their iconic roles that everyone loved them for, and I swear, their acting and chemistry here is like they made the movie a day after the first one. I can't imagine the duo being any different. It's so great to see Carrey return to the roles he's always been good at.  Needless to say, these two kill it together. Of course, this is a DD movie, so the humour will be pretty dumb. I, myself, like this humour very much at times, which means I just adored the humour. Some parts even had me in stitches, and just like the pissing in a beer bottle and \"we called it a **** scene from the first one, there's some huge laughs here that I will remember for months. The humour doesn't always hit as hard as it should, but all the other big laughs mostly made up for that. If you love the first DD, you will enjoy this one. If you weren't really a big fan of it, you're not gonna enjoy this one.

It's cheap, and not just dumb, actually cringe worthy the whole way through. No effort. It's kind of like Anchorman 2. Everything from everyone not channeling the spirit of their original characters, oddly filmed with a stupidly high fram rate and unwelcomed style in general. In motion it looks like a British soap opera, makes me almost sick to look at it.",

The characters had no personality whatsoever, just being your typical people/rich people. Some may enjoy it, but for me it's best left forgotten.",

      "text": "I wasn\u2019t even 10 when the first Dumb & Dumber was released in 1994. Twenty years ago, Jim Carrey was the hero of a generation: he was Ace Ventura and The Mask, and every kid at school imitated his catchphrases at every occasion. We still didn\u2019t know about the awful films that would come in the following couple of years (before he found his redemption with The Truman Show), and leave an indelible mark on his career. His co-star was Jeff Daniels, who also appeared in Speed, but didn\u2019t have a fraction of Carrey\u2019s fame. Daniels reportedly agreed to get involved in Dumb & Dumber for $50,000 (while Carrey\u2019s salary was around $7 million, nearly half of the whole film\u2019s budget), just because he was keen to star in a comedy. By pairing Carrey (Lloyd) and Daniels (Harry), and having them perform a bunch of idiotic stunts, the then newcomers Bobby and Peter Farrelly created one of the most iconic slapstick comedies of the \u201890s, and achieved an incredible financial success. I\u2019m not sure I would find it as funny now, but it still is significantly better than its simple-minded and slack sequel, Dumb and Dumber To.",

      "text": "After twenty long years, Harry and Lloyd are back AND... most people didn't care. Despite the success of the first film, the Farrelly's waited far too long to bring the pair back. Everyone who grew up watching the first film are adults now, and the demographic they were going for with a PG-13 rating, has no idea who Harry and Lloyd are, hence the disappointing numbers at the box office. In this long awaited sequel, Harry (Jeff Daniels) is in need of a kidney and finds out that his only living relative is a daughter he never knew about. That's all it take to get Harry and Lloyd back on the road for more antics AND... they tried too hard. The original film was legitimately laugh out loud funny, while it's sequel may lead to a snicker or two. The beauty of the original is that it was so simple and so stupid that you couldn't help but laugh. The new one is full of long running pranks, modern slang the pair don't understand, and just obvious jokes. There's absolutely no spontaneity, like when Harry chucks the salt over his shoulder or Lloyd puts laxative in Harry's tea. That's not the only issue here, as the bad guys are kind of the biggest joke in the movie and Lloyd finally crosses the line from cute to creepy. The bottom line, I loved seeing Carrey and Daniels together again and I enjoyed the parallels to the first film, but aside from a few misunderstandings and a line here or there, this film isn't even close to being the film fans waited twenty years to see.",

There are some really funny moments and a lot of reminiscing from the first film which I feel was done really well.
