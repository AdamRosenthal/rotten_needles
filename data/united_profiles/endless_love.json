In David Elliot\u2019s (Alex Pettyfer) case, love lost, as his therapist tells him, is \u201clike a book you read long ago\u201d, and those words could not be more true for Endless Love. Aside from being a remake of Brooke Sheilds\u2019 1981 film of the same name, the film is also an exercise to see how Shakespeare\u2019s famous tragedy, written almost 420 years ago, could be modernized, interpreted and adapted for a Pinterest-driven, Instagram-obsessed generation of young people. But like the amaro, hudson and mayfair filters featured on the highly addictive mobile app, Endless Love is a sun kissed love story told through the lens of a writer/director that is beautiful to look at, and understands what it\u2019s audience wants, especially during one of the most forcefully romantic times of the year.",

Case in point; The two leads have sex within three days of meeting each other and it's portrayed as the right thing for them to do.  Did I mention that they're supposed to be 17?  Yeah.  The movie is supportive of teenagers being \"young and dumb\" and throwing every moral and scrap of logical thinking out the window.  They have sex at least 3 times within their first week of dating and they do it every chance they get.  I was thinking, \"What is this, Basic Instinct?\"  Sadly, there are no ice pick murderers here, just corny dialogue and the most unoriginal story ever.  Endless definitely fits this movie.

I usually like romantic movies as a distraction to everyday reality but this movie had so many incoherences and it was so ridiculous that I couldn't even focus on the romantic story. The first hour is at least entertaining. It looks more like a videoclip or a clothing advertisement but it gets you in a romantic mood, wishing to find a fairytale love as the one the main characters share. However, in the middle of the movie, things get out of control when the writers try to make up barriers for the couple to be together in the form of an over controlling father in a story that could have had a little sense in the 50s, but never in the 21st century. The script seems to be written sometimes by a 12 year old with a lot of imagination and no sense of reality at all. Of course that is the target intended for the film so at least they may be happy.",

Yes, drama was obviously the goal, but who could turn down artists like Lord Huron, Ecosmith, In The Valley Below, and the killer Tegan and Sara? All of which paired flawlessly with the voiceless and beautiful montages of carefree, privileged and painfully attractive eighteen year olds prancing around the 1%'er south.
