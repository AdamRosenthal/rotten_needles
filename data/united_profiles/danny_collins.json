The premise, intriguing, is wasted by turning it from what might have been an interesting transformation in someone who has wasted his considerable artistic potential for a successful sell out career in schlock and instead veers into a horribly cliched family drama. Pacino is never believable in this role as an aging rock star. He chews the scenery a bit and overacts, as he usually does these days, but never convinces that he is actually a musician. The few on stage moments are embarrassingly bad, albeit as they are intended to be but in way not intended. The few scenes in which he is writing songs at the piano never convince that this guy could ever sing, making Dylan and Cohen sound like Pavarotti. Plummer does a fine job as Danny's friend and manager, Benning's character makes no sense and while the family is adorable and the considerably able supporting cast does their best, they can't really make up for the hole in the middle of this film. Pacino is miscast as Danny Collins unless having someone look like an aging, over the top mafioso doing karaoke was the aim of the director. If making Yoko Ono a few bucks on the soundtrack was the intention, maybe this films score but, to me, Danny Collins is a muddle at best and the \"what if\" premise is wasted completely. The movie would have worked as well or as badly without it.",

Even though the situation's unique, not a lot about the story is original. Annette Bening provides a charming romantic flirtation and the granddaughter is delightful. It moves along with enuff pluck to occasionally amuse and gradually work its way into our hearts. One of the best things is the soundtrack, which is full of Lennon's wonderful songs. A sweetly charming addition to Pacino's resume.",

His portrayal of fading rock star Danny Collins is believable and touching, and his budding romance with a hotel manager is made very moving by having the excellent Annette Bening play opposite him. Throw in Christopher Plummer as his grumpy agent and you have three older Hollywood stalwarts showing the youngsters a thing or two. The only bum note is the song that supposedly made Danny famous - you won't buy it for a second!",
