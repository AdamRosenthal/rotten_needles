Certainly not a memorable experience on all fronts but effective in its entertainment value, the film delivered some interesting sequences: namely the bee chase and the a sequence involving a gigantic electric eel. The problem I noted is that the film did not capitalize on the concept of the big beasties as well as it should have. For example, a dangerous trek through the most horrifying part of the island is summed up in a montage that features no giant creatures or any survivalistic actions. Simply put, the segment plays out like a Sunday stroll. The acting was pretty good though nothing to write home about. It is the breathtaking views the island presents that seal the deal, serving as a perfectly exotic backdrop for some thrilling action sequences.",

The characters seem to be plainly drawn and even veteran Michael Caine as the grandfather doesn't redeem this movie's mediocrity. That is the worst thing to do when crafting a film, not making it terribly, but making it run of the mill stuff. Basically, the film's positive highlights are this: the afore-mentioned visuals, Vanessa Hudgens in a tank-top, and Dwayne Johnson, particularly in a scene involving a berry-flick-by-his-pecs, which seems to take place out of nowhere. Basically, they're walking through the jungle, Josh Hutcherson says something about girls, then Dwayne Johnson says: \"Here Josh. I'll flick a berry off of my nipple and that will obviously help you with your girl problems\". Then he flicks several berries off of his nipple. It made no sense but was the only ludicrously enjoyable moment. Basically, Journey 2 is just a movie going through the motions with little sense of adventure and thrill and a diluted feeling of fun.
