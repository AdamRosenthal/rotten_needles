Mostly showed him performing and different periods of his career.  Only a little bit with issues with the band, but it never really went into the heart and core of who the guy was.  For instance he was arrested multiple times for a number of things, and the film barely shows any of that.  It shows 1 or 2 incidents but in such a favorable light that it doesn't have much impact and does not reveal the truth.  I like realitic biopics that really shed new light on a person and this movie did very little in that regard except showing a little bit of his upbrining, but never went into WHY he did what he did, WHY he acted that way.  It made no attempt to explain or explore the real James Brown and spent 70% of the time showing a favorable version of him and performance pieces for Chadwick Boseman (who did OK but did not really capture the guys darker side much.)   For a guy who brutally attacked his wife, almost shot people with a shotgun, and had ongoing personal problems with his bandmates this film glossed over 70% of that to try to make the guy look likable and felt more like a tribute to James Brown than an honest look at his life.  It was decently done though and was certainly worth watching, but it was just OK overall.",

Even with the no-holds-barred depiction of his flaws, all of his hits are performed (with the real Brown's vocals) to make the experience a super-funky groove.

The storytelling could have been a little better (it kept jumping around in time throughout), but the direction was strong for the most part and felt very focused. The soundtrack is also great, as expected. The acting from all is also good, however, the real superstar here is Chadwick Boseman. In a true Oscar nomination-worthy performance, Boseman really embodies Brown to a t and really brings the \"funk\" and \"groove\" in his performance and his dance moves. This was a true powerhouse performance from an actor who is clearly somebody on the rise. At the end of the day, it is a biopic and it is hard to cover everything in a person's life in a 2 hour+ time frame, but I think this one did pretty well (even if it did jump around and gloss over some things) and, as I said, felt very fair.
