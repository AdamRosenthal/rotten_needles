Most of the reviews I have read are from those who have not read the book, who are complaining about the unanswered ending. Lois Lowry purposely made the ending ambiguous, you cannot blame the movie for that (and there shouldn't even be any blame; ambiguous endings give the readers/viewers power to interpret and analyze for themselves). There were a few minor details removed from the movie, but I believe that they were left out to be able to be appropriate for younger audiences while maintaining the more mature audience who may have read the book. An example of this is the neglect of the \"Stirrings\" that Jonas experiences, which is replaced with a brief dream of Jonas kissing Fiona. An important detail left out was the House of the Old.",

Love, Color, Happiness, Hunger, Birth. Those are the things that The Community doesn't have. It's a diffrent world from ours, and yes, it's pretty sci-fi. Newcomer Brendon Thwaits does a good job of acting as Jonas, he was smart and energetic. Jeff Bridges is good as the Giver and Meyrl Streep is okay as the community elder, the woman who thinks if people choose, they will choose wrong. The story is not totally the same. Some honest changes were made. The film is slow and drags a bit at the climax. But if you don't mind a good movie that treats its subject matter well. Watch, The Giver.",

I will start my review at the ending because it goes beyond what the book did and gives the audience hope for the future of these characters and I liked that. People are complaining that questions are still left unanswered, I hate when people complain about these things because I feel that there some things that should be left to interpretation and that the filmmakers shouldn't have to spoon feed everything to the audience. The acting is amazing especially Jeff Bridges, you could tell that he had a lot of passion behind this project. This movie also has easily some of the most amazing visuals that are a true treat for the eyes. I loved how this movie handles its dense themes and made them worth while and interesting. Quite possibly the best thing about this movie is the way it handled the source materiel, it took some liberties and removed or altered the things that didn't work and preserved the things that were excellent about the book. This is a rare score that I give this many 10's but this is the 4th 10 of the year (alongside X-Men: Days of Future Past, Under the Skin and Chef). I highly recommend checking this movie out if you can.",

It turns into a straight up good vs. evil story and is generic and clich\u00e9 as possible. Once again Hollywood has taken a story that is unique and wonderful and skinned it into something bland and generic. As much as I love seeing awesome books made into movies I want to see it done well and not try to cater to the masses. This film based on a book about dystopian society feels very much like it was trying to capitalize on people\u2019s love the Hunger Games, which also deals with rising up. I only hope that people are reading the books these films are based on as opposed to the mainstreamed versions we get now. Had the film just stuck closer to the story like it was doing pretty well in the first half or so this would have been a really nice film but because it turned into generic good vs. evil and fighting against dystopian society the film lost that special something that made the book so memorable and unique. Which is why I am forced to \u201cGive\u201d this movie a 5.5. Could\u2019ve been a 7/10 but you just had to cater to the masses.

Your 2 main stars here are Brenton Thwaites and Jeff Bridges. They are both awesome. Plus, Meryl Streep knocks it out of the park. Odeya Rush was suprisingly very good. Everybody else was basic. The story here is definitely nothing groundbreaking, but it still offers enjoyment. Jonas is chosen to be the one who works with the Giver, and the Giver goes on to share memories of the past world that is now behind them. Watching Jonas' journey as a character finding out all of the beautiful stuff the past world had was thoroughly entertaining. This movie also has some really great lessons behind it that left me still sitting in my seat for a few minutes after the movie was over. However, a lot of the stuff in this movie can just be average, such as the writing. Plus, I felt the story could've used a tad bit more energy in some parts.

      "text": "The Giver reminds me of two other 2014 films, Transcendence and Divergent (both of which I also have reviewed on Metacritic). Why? The Giver is similar to Transcendence because both films took a while to make (of course The Giver was in the process of being made much longer by Jeff Bridges). Both also have good and respected actors---Transcendence has Rebecca Hall, Paul Bettany, Kate Mara, Cillian Murphy, and Morgan Freeman while The Giver has Jeff Bridges, Meryl Streep, Katie Holmes, and Alexander Skarsgard. The Giver is also similar to Divergent because (I don\u2019t like to say this, but) both YA novels and their movie adaptations have implausible utopian futures and societies.",

It dips into the age old questions on what is right and what is wrong. The angle is kind of different because they try to control everyone enough so that everyone does the RIGHT thing. Which seems good in thought and theory but shows up in a society just like the one you see in the movie, void of real love, affection, and feeling. Which falls the argument, if you can't feel, it means you are free from heartache, pain, betrayal, and all the bad things, so which one is really better? All that ensues and is part of the idea this movie presents, but the way it was presented was without much of anything all the entertaining...which is kind of important because that's the point this world isn't entertaining...so why go make a movie about it? The Giver himself was pretty much the only voice of reality and reason which got annoying, I mean no one else even bothered to think of other things? How does the giver have those powers anyway? Wasn't explained very well, and if they didn't want their thoughts to be opened why did they even bother having the whole giver thing made in the first place?

However, the book's deep, thought-provoking themes and ideas are lost through the Young Adult Film mould implemented on the story. The story adds an unnecessary romantic subplot and lacks suspense or any real drama, just moving from beginning to end. Strong performances from Jeff Bridges and Meryl Streep overshadow underwhelming performances by the younger actors. Although this film swayed from the source material to fit a niche of popular films, the world created in this series is worth exploring in other films.

This is one of the better recent offereings, with a coherent plot, moderate adventure, the odd not-too-violent thrills and without too much dumbing-down of dialogue. I almost felt young again. I'm not surprised that Meryl Streep and Jeff Bridges agreed to do it. It's fluff and nonsense, but it's enjoyable and entertaining.",
