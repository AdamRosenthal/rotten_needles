(adults laughing out loud funny). The three stars captured the characters perfectly (amazingly even). and there is a plot, and plot-twits even..kinda..(but that was secondary to me). TheF  Bros. caught the essenese of the stories and jokes. Much research must have gone into  it. (tough job, huh?) While the jokes are good, you have to enjoy slapstick humor. I now hope it does well enough for a sequel. Nothing offensive. There is a disclaimer at the end for kids NOT to do this at home.

I recently just returned from the middle east where I was sent when I joined the M.C.  When I returned I was delighted to hear about a tribute being made of the stooges by the Farrelly brothers. I went and saw the movie with my fiancee, who is also and avid stooge fan, and 30 minutes into the movie we left. Why? This series of short tributes was a travesty to say the least. I have been shot and hit by pieces of shrapnel and didn't shed a tear. This tragic farce of a film actually made me so angry that I cried knowing that the real stooges would never have written such a despicable film and that people would actually have the to allow this trash to even go to script. In closing this film is the next worst thing next to the extermination of the Jewish people during the holocaust and if Peter and Bobby  Farrelly had any sense they would erase any idea of making more of these short films.

Though the \"Big-3\" (Hayes, Sasso, and Diamantopoulos) turn in first rate impersonations, carrying out the same aching eye-pokes, excruciating hair pulls, bone-crushing skull slaps, and nasty knuckle sandwiches, not to mention the familiar dissonant squabbling and airy mindlessness, they don't even bother to deviate from just that: impersonations; the characters have no intention to extend themselves beyond a 'Mad-TV'-esque imitation-comedy-skit--offering little else than ephemerally visible-but-not-felt- smiles, followed by long-lasting regret and discontent. And, adding to the feeling are cheap laughs, underdeveloped cameo appearances from modern \"characters\" ('Jersey Shore' cast members among them), cheap and flatly-shot scenes, desultorily unapt classic-rock scores, as well as reproachably classless, and dismal attempts to appeal to contemporary audiences--breast and bathroom jokes with references to drug use--all of which disceptively slide past the approbated PG-rating. Did the fillmmakers fail to realize their forbear was clean? Ultimately, the Farrelly brothers, regardless of their own inspirations, don't create anything inspiring--they create a travesty--and participate in an exercise of fully-fledged defaming.

Details are somewhat inconsistent in his script, but the comedy moves so that the audience laughter could distract from the small details of continuity.

All the eye pocking and Hammering was good but sometimes it wasn't funny like the original . The Three acted good but the story was horrible . All that three act was the worst episode of Three Stooges . Sofia did good among the other cast and she was actually funny but that's it . The Beach People's cameo was the worst . Compering to Dumb and Dumber (The greatest funny movie of all) this one is nothing . Acting of the Stooges were good but the story was too awful to like the whole Movie !",

And I remember how excited I was at the thought of a film, and I remember falling over laughing when I saw the trailer. Then I saw the film...and it wasn't nearly as funny. While it does stay true to the show and feature some really great performances, it unfortunately stales out too quickly and proves that slapstick doesn't help a 92-minute film achieve comic greatness. Though HARDCORE fans of the show may find something to enjoy here, I really can't recommend seeing the film unless it's \"Bad Movie Night.\" You can do far worse, but you can also do WAY better than \"The Three Stooges.\"",
