Orgies may have their place in depicting a scene in a Roman harem but they simply detract from the film and like most of the unneeded scenes, add to the uncomfortable length of the picture.

      "text": "Wolf of Wall Street is one of my top 3 picks for most over-rated movie of the year (after Inside Llewyn Davis and Fruitvale Station). It\u2019s a portrayal of Wall Street in the 1980\u2019s. If you were alive and over 18 back then you already know this was a time of excess, immorality and corruption.  Scorsese presents all this in truly over-the-top fashion, while offering no insight or enlightenment about any of it.  At 3 hours, the movie is way, way too long.  It drags, in part, because several scenes are repeated over and over.  The movie also borrows heavily from previous Scorsese movies, especially Goodfellas, and you may find yourself saying, \u201cI\u2019ve seen this before.\u201d  What Wolf lacks in originality, Scorsese tries to make up for through excess.  Despite lots of beautiful naked women, Scorsese amps the level of cursing, drug use and orgies to the point where it actually becomes boring and monotonous.  Impossible, you say?  I wish!  Still want to see this move, but need an excuse?  Thinking of playing the \u201cmy girlfriend is a Leonardo DiCaprio fan\u201d card?  Don\u2019t, she\u2019s going to be disappointed, too.  Leo\u2019s not very sexy when he\u2019s on Quaaludes (frequently) or when he\u2019s repeatedly cheating on his wives (constantly). Whether you\u2019re male or female, it\u2019s hard to feel much affinity with DiCaprio\u2019s character (Jordan Belfort) and DiCaprio\u2019s acting, while physical in nature (think Matthew Perry-The Whole Nine Yards), isn\u2019t compelling.  Jonah Hill\u2019s portrayal of Donnie Azoff provides some laughs, but ultimately his character isn\u2019t very likeable either. The movie is so uninspiring the only thoughts it provokes are along the lines of, \u201cIf I had that much money, there\u2019s no way I would have screwed things up so badly.\u201d  This movie is for hard-core Scorsese fans only.",

Also DiCaprio's snorfest The Great Gatsby is basically the same story except you get to see full frontal nudity and pure decadence in this film. This one does it better than those ones as it give you very interesting characters to watch even if you do not agree with their motives and ambitions.",

The film follows the working life (initially) of a young, ambitious Jordan Belfort. Appearing as a 'straight arrow' at first, the money churning capitalist machine that is wall street consumes Belfort and all of he's decency, with assistance from Donnie (Hill) and Mark, (McConaughey) becomes a money hungry despicable and sometimes animalistic creature.

Nevertheless, it works perfectly! The story of Jordan Belfort transitions from comedic and crazy in the first half to dramatic and serious in the second! Both aspects worked perfectly in detailing his crazy, messed up life. DiCaprio's portrayal of Belfort is flawless and should go down as his best performance in his entire career! Jonah Hill was often times hilarious and made for a great comic relief in the more dramatic and serious parts of the film. Matthew McConaughey was very thought-provoking and funny in his small role at the beginning. All of the other supporting cast members did great and helped this film run along smoothly. But overall, in its lengthy 3-hour runtime, Scorsese creates what is (in my opinion) his absolute best film to date (and yes, even better than Goodfellas!)

      "text": "The Wolf of Wall Street is a 3 hour adrenaline rush that is moving at the same pace as it's drug-addicted characters. It is a film about the darker side of the stock market, and people need to realize that it is not glorifying the amazingly true story of Jordan Belfort. The film does contain a strong amount of humor and is very entertaining to watch, but it all builds up to Belfort's downfall and he sure falls hard. Leo does gives his best performance yet and makes the viewer laugh, sigh, and even squirm as some parts of the film are extremely explicit and uncomfortable. Overall though, this film is truly a masterpiece in every way and deserves universal praise. It is being looked down upon because people are finally realizing that the wealthy in this country don't always get their wealth by the best means and many people are having a hard time accepting it. Scorsese does a wonderful job displaying Belfort's story and opening the public's eyes to the \"wolves\" of wall street.",

Also, if you're trying to adapt a book into a movie, just take note of this film, so props to Terrence Winter. What made this film so incredible, though, was the performance by DiCaprio. If he doesn't win the Oscar for this film, then something's wrong. He played the part beautifully, from Belfort's rise, to his fall. The only reason this film won't win best picture is because of how inappropriate it can be sometimes. But, that being, this film is for everybody. The person who wants to see a really good movie, or someone who wants to be entertained. This film's got both, and  Scorsese always manages to do so. This film is highly recommended, and I'll say it again. If DiCaprio doesn't win, then there's a huge problem.",

I'm simply amazed that there is not one funny or intense scene it is just boring boring dullness better off to go see a real porno movie with a little plot.",

Don't get me wrong though, the women are gorgeous and you would probably do the same as Leonardo's character if you were in his position. There's also A LOT of drugs. SO DO NOT BRING KIDS TO THIS MOVIE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES. The question you ask yourself while walking out is was all this extreme content really necessary to illustrate the simple theme of how greed and corruption destroy people? This movie was definitely engineered in order to shock and trust me it succeeded, but left me very startled at the same time. The script itself is very well written and it is probably one of Leonardo's best performances to date, but the movie content itself just gets in the way most of the time. However, Dicaprio's speeches in front of his entire staff are quite incredible. Overall, as I mentioned before, I really don't know what to make of this movie. It has both great and disturbing qualities that battle each other throughout the entire film.",

Every other word may be  and at times, I wanted to leave because after 300 uses of ****ing---it loses emphasis. (506 f u c k uses)  There is an important message here. The moral errosion, the twisted deceit and the overwhelming lack of a solid plot, this is what is out there in the world. Especially in the US.  Now, as for my rating of six, I did not love the movie. I thought it had its pros and cons. For starters, cut the sex scenes down, trim down the use of f u c k (which I am not offended by, but it definitely loses emphasis) and show if Belfort was in any way full of remorse. The second half of the picture is better, gaining personal ground and...well,the whole point was to share this ridiculous story, to batter our minds with a genuine question of \"why?\". My feelings are somewhat mixed. Some scenes are too long when you get th point, entertaining here and there, and it never fails to show you. I am not a prude. I just think it went over the top, which is what is should have done, but there is something about WOWS that I couldn't connect to. If you're debating whether or not to see it, please do.

However the main and most obvious reason why The Wolf of Wall Street is so entertaining is because of how outlandish and crazy close to every scene is. In places you almost forget that it's based on true events. From the immature conversation between Belfort and his mentor, played brilliantly by Matthew McConaughey, to the hilarious but quite juvenile night where Di Caprio and Hill get the strongest high known to man, it is ridiculously entertaining. And also worryingly enjoyable due to the extreme amount of sex, nudity, violence and drugs much like the far wittier 2013 movie Don Jon. Overall The Wolf of Wall Street will keep you interested through its whole runtime despite it being 3 hours long, but may repel some more sensitive viewers due to its mature content.",

      "text": "The Wolf of Wall Street is the story of a truly infamous man, Jordan Belfort, who had a stock market company that broke all the rules and then some. As a film, this movie does the same thing. It is shockingly outrageous as it follows his story of corruption, greed, sex, drugs, and other terrible things. The amazing thing is that this movie does all this in all the right ways to make a movie that will blow you away and leave you thinking about it after the credits. I cannot talk about anything else without mentioning Leonardo DiCaprio's performance as the main character. He is absolutely phenomenal, and this film just adds to all the other career-defining performances he has done. He perfectly captures what this man in real life was. Jonah Hill, Margot Robbie, and Rob Reiner also do amazing performances. All the others did fine jobs, but some characters were underdeveloped. Seeing this man's journey felt extremely powerful over this 3 hour long film, but it moves at such a quick rate that it comes out as even more entertaining. With that quick pace, though, it adds minor plot holes to the film, but there nearly non-noticeable. The drama is amazingly done, along with the sharp-as-blades writing. Yes, this film is very, very brash and/or repulsive, but it makes sense with the story for it to just show how corrupt Belfort's and the people he worked with lives were. The film also sprinkles in a little bit of humour, but I wish it were a larger portion of the movie. The Wolf of Wall Street will go down as one of Martin Scorcese's best films, along with one of DiCaprio's best performances ever. The minor flaws are so overshadowed by the rest of the amazements. It is, without a doubt, one of the best films of the past decade.",

Leo delivers another thrilling and oscar-worthy role in a three hour (yes, three hour) march through a life of debauchery and criminal activity that has leagues of people falling in line.  The movie requires a bit of thicker skin as there is plenty of skin shown and more than a few F-bombs thrown about - if you aren't swayed by these things then you're not going to be put-off by the \"vulgar\" content alone.  There's an undeniable cool to everything here.  We've all seen actors doing cocaine off a stripper's body, but those moments are rarely coupled with the threat of a good time at a summer party, only the party takes place everywhere the camera points.  I loved this movie, enough that I'd highly recommend it.  Its greatest weakness really is run-time.  3 hours was fine for a first-run, but that's Lord of the Rings extended edition territory and there's not nearly as much action here so the time might cause you to wonder \"what time is it?\" once or twice.  See it once at least but, if you're like me, don't worry about seeing it again.  It lasts well-enough on a first run that you may never bother with it again.

It's arguably Martin Scorcese's best film in quite some time. It's an outrageously awesome film from start to finish and believe me that's a long running time. The movie itself is based on the true story of Jordan Belfort and follows his rise from forming his own company to becoming a wealthy stockbrocker living the high life to his fall due to his involvment in crime, corruption and the federal government. Leonardo DiCaprio is at his best. He delivers a truly majestic performance in his depiction as Jordan Belfort, he's phenominal. You genuinely have to wonder what the man has to do for an Oscar because based on this he is more than worthy of one! Jonah Hill excels as Donnie Azoff. For a man who is a stalwart in comedy his turn here is a masterstroke. He's very convincing and his screentime with Leo is not only memorable but strikes absolute gold! They are a dynamite duo. Margot Robbie has her big screen debut and believe me it's one you won't forget. She's not only beautiful, and believe me that's an understatement, but she delivers a solid performance. There's also noteable performances from Jon Bernthal, Jean Dujardin and Joanna Lumley to mention a few but perhaps most significantly is the role that Matthew McConaughey has. It's small but sensational. He'll have you beating your chest and humming along. Scorcese is on top form. His direction has always been brilliant but this is crudely classic!

Coupled with the 4th wall breaking style of narration, it really drags you into the ride. Problem is, the film is an hour too long. Leo's constant energy wears on you. Its so much for so long that you get lost in the ocean that is the wolf of wallstreet. The length also kind of drowns out Chandler. His character is left stuck mostly in the background as if he's more set decor than character. Chandler brings life to the moments he's in, but I just wish part of the three hours I invested spent more time with him, tghey could've cut a drug fueled scene or two for him. The tale is so sprawling that once you watch you seem to agree with its runtime, but when you reconsider, you will realize that you only gave it a pass because its a scorsese film.

The amazing part about this film is that it is full of debauchery, disgusting acts, and just absolute greed and selfishness, yet I find myself rooting for Belfort and the rest of Stratton Oakmont. I know I am not supposed to, yet I absolutely did. Helmed by the always reliable Martin Scorsese, The Wolf of Wall Street lives up to the hype for me and delivers. It is quite over the top and hard-hitting, sometimes to degrees where it becomes like, \"Oh come on,\" but regardless, it is endlessly watchable. DiCaprio did great as expected and is undoubtably the reason why I sort of aligned myself with Belfort in spite of his horrendous acts of disregard and debauchery throughout. I thought Jonah Hill was good, not great. The real star of the show here though has to be Terrence Winter. The script is impeccable and is truly why this one will live on, as it is quotable at every turn. Not my favorite film turned out by Scorsese, but regardless, it is better than most and one of the best of 2013.",

      "text": "Per raccontare la vita sciagurata di Jordan Belfort, Scorsese recupera la struttura di uno dei suoi film migliori in assoluto, \u2018Quei bravi ragazzi\u2019. In entrambi i casi, alla base c\u2019\u00e8 la (auto)biografia del protagonista che racconta la propria parabola esistenziale senza risparmiarsi le peggiori abiezioni, ma lasciando una vaga sensazione di nostalgia per i giorni di gloria a dar l'impressione che il pentimento non sia proprio completo: la sceneggiatura (qui firmata da Terence Winter) la trasforma in un racconto in prima persona, con la voce sopra del protagonista che, d'ogni tanto, si rivolge direttamente allo spettatore guardando in macchina mentre attorno a lui la sua storia procede a ritmo adrenalinico, quell'adrenalina che \u2013 grazie ad abbondanti aiuti chimici \u2013 sostiene gli insaziabili personaggi che la popolano. Se Henry Hill aveva sempre voluto essere un gangster, Jordan Belfort ha come unico scopo i soldi a qualsiasi costo per fare la bella vita (non per niente, la sua ispirazione \u00e8 stato il Gordon Gekko de \u2018l'avidit\u00e0 \u00e8 bella\u2019 in \u2018Wall Street\u2019): entrambi verranno fregati, alla fine, dalla sensazione di onnipotenza che un'impunit\u00e0 troppo prolungata procura loro, oltre alla perdita del controllo dovuta ai troppi stupefacenti. Belfort \u00e8 un ingordo: di sesso, alcool, droga e, ovviamente, del denaro che serve a comprarli. Forte di una grande capacit\u00e0 di venditore con un tappeto sullo stomaco, inizia a piazzare titoli spazzatura a sprovveduti piccoli investitori confidando sulla magnetica attrattiva che i soldi facili hanno su chiunque: quando, dal piccolo gruppo di disperati che ha raccolto, la sua societ\u00e0 inizia a diventare una potenza grazie anche a commissioni salatissime, comincia una caccia all'investitore istituzionale e, da una posizione in bilico su ci\u00f2 che \u00e8 consentito, ci si inoltra sempre pi\u00f9 nei territori dell'illegalit\u00e0, inevitabile calamita per l'attenzione dei federali che - un po\u2019 per testardaggine, un po\u2019 per fortuna \u2013 finiranno per incastrarlo. Varie critiche sono piovute sul film perch\u00e9 non mostra le conseguenze delle azioni del protagonista e della sua societ\u00e0, soprattutto per quanto riguarda la gente che ha distrutto i propri risparmi inseguendo i sogni di ricchezza promessi da un pugno di truffatori senza scrupoli: sarebbe per\u00f2 stato uscire dal seminato del racconto, tanto pi\u00f9 che, dalle loro azioni, si capisce benissimo che genere di persone fossero Jordan e compagnia (se non bastasse la brutale spiegazione su come funziona il brokeraggio affidata al trasformista McConaughey poco dopo l'inizio). Il giudizio su di loro \u00e8 difatti spietato, un gruppo di persone moralmente abiette, pronte a bruciare le montagne di soldi malamente fatti in orge propulse da quantit\u00e0 industriali di droghe: i rapporti sessuali, anche di gruppo, e gli intossicamenti vari si sprecano \u2013 compreso un corso in Quaalude per chi si fosse perso quello nei romanzi di Ellroy \u2013 e non stupisce allora che il film abbia una produzione indipendente, lontana dagli studios. Di questa bella gente, Belfort \u00e8 il leader assoluto, un avido e spietato bastardo dentro che distorce il mito, molto statunitense, dell'uomo che si \u00e8 fatto da s\u00e9, ma che \u00e8 una sorta di dio per chi lavora per lui e ne condivide gli \u2018ideali\u2019. Interessato solo a se stesso, non si limita a fregare gli sconosciuti clienti, ma chiunque gli stia intorno se solo c'\u00e8 da guadagnarci in qualche modo: ovviamente fedifrago nei confronti delle due mogli (anche se la seconda ha le mirabili fattezze di Margit Robbie) e, infine, disposto a tradire i suoi soci per scampare una pena ben pi\u00f9 dura dei tre anni che gli vengono comminati. Nei suoi panni, DiCaprio \u2013 che \u00e8 stato il motore del progetto \u2013 \u00e8 semplicemente perfetto, dando un'ulteriore testimonianza di una maturazione attoriale ormai compiuta: non da meno \u00e8 il resto dello smisurato cast, nel quale non si pu\u00f2 non sottolineare la bravura di Jonah Hill nei rotondi, esagitati panni del sodale di sempre Donnie. Scorsese racconta le loro avventure puntando sul registro dell'ironia acida piuttosto che su quello del dramma, tenendo alto il ritmo grazie alla serrata scrittura di Winter (sulla quale gli attori sono stati spesso liberi di improvvisare) e a scelte visive che sanno colpire per la loro efficacia, a partire dalla decisione di utilizzare un montaggio irregolare e lenti anamorfiche (la fotografia \u00e8 di Rodrigo Prieto) quando i personaggi, e in particolare Jordan, sono strafatti. Ne escono cos\u00ec numerose scene da ricordare, ad esempio quando Belfort incontra per la prima volta l'agente Denham (Kyle Chandler) a bordo del proprio yacht oppure tutto il lungo episodio dello sballo da Quaalude. Quest'ultimo d\u00e0 anche lustro a una terza ora complessivamente pi\u00f9 debole e faticosa delle due, al limite della perfezione, che la hanno preceduta: una perdita di ritmo che abbassa di qualche decimale il giudizio complessivo anche per colpa della sconcertante banalit\u00e0 dell'episodio \u2018italiano\u2019 .",

Said controversy comes in the form of 'The Wolf of Wall Street'; which reunites master filmmaker Martin Scorsese and actor, Leonardo DiCaprio, after a one film hiatus. It feels so long. Anyway, DiCaprio gives a stellar performance as Jordan Belfort, a real life New York stockbroker who ran a firm that engaged in securities fraud and corruption on Wall Street in the 1990's. There was much talks about the film and the way it glorifies the explosive, hedonistic ways of the wealthy one percent. But despite all the \"coolness\" we are seeing on the screen, is it indeed a glorification or simply a backhanded representation of these drugged out, sex crazed \"fiends\". Terrence Winter's expletive laden script, was darkly hilarious! I call this the funniest film of the year. The screenplay was incredibly smart and builds a band of memorable characters; with due credit to Scorsese's direction and the supporting cast's (and ofcourse Leo's) electric performances. However I did take a little issue with the length of the story which wielded a staggering three hour run-time on film. Detailing the meteoric rise and fall of the infamous stock broker was a meteoric accomplishment for Scorsese and his usual editor Thelma Schoonmaker. There collaboration made every minute of those three hours entertaining and memorable; very good work. 'The Wolf of Wall Street' was a lot of things; sharp, crude, funny and possibly even iconic. One thing is certain, it was awesomely entertaining.",

Leonardo Di Caprio, a favorite of mine, took everything he has learned from his blonde innocent locks in Titanic to his Lucretius and neck- wringing performance in Django Unchained. But here, every murmur, every breath is pure brilliance. It is definitely Martin and Leo's best work together yet. Jonah Hill also grants me with joy, but does not surprise me. Because I know, that he is one of the best actors to ever come from his stereotypical down-faults. He makes this character so real, so fresh, so high. The only thing that keeps this film from a perfect 10 score, is it's potential, but stays on a pretty opaque path throughout. The character growth of Jordan and his associates are grand, in the beginning, but never has a real second growth after they reach their American Psycho aficionado stage. I digress, 9/10.

The bad reviews, in my opinion, stem from a lack of understanding of the core intent of the film and an oversensitivity to the various topics touched in the throughout. The definition of satire is \"the use of humor, irony, exaggeration, or ridicule to expose and criticize people's stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues\" (straight off google). How can you claim that this film doesn't fit that definition? Yes, it's a controversial issue, its hard not to offend people (all satires offend at least some people), but to say that its promoting drug use, greed, sexual fantasies, misogyny, etc. is ridiculous and just suggests a superficial interpretation of the film (which never bodes well for a satirical piece). Anyway, now that I'm done ranting, I thought DiCaprio and Jonah Hill were incredible, I thought the dialog was hilarious, and there are few satires that I genuinely feel are this well executed. My one gripe is that the last 30 minutes dragged on a little slowly, but I still felt like those moments were necessary to come to a proper conclusion. So to those of you who have yet to see it, please do not interpret everything so literally, everything is over-the-top for a reason. I hope you enjoy this work of art as much as I did.",

I will warn that it's not for everyone, and if you don't feel like sitting through three hours of drinking, drugs, sex, cursing, corruption, scandal, fraud, and every other controversy you can think of, you might want to skip out on this one for something with a little less debate to it, but all things considered, \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" is an extremely memorable and well-constructed film that should stick with you long after you watch it.",

The pace can be electrifying at times, so good you forget the 3 hour running time. Cinematically, it has subtle moments of genius. So why a mediocre review? Personal prejudice with the subject matter. While watching this movie, you wait for redemption or at least true punishment. You expect Jake LaMotta to live a sad life, Henry Hill to crumble and Joe Pesci was doomed in both Goodfellas and Casino. They were satisfying endings because in the moral mind of the audience, they reaped what they had sown. I don't believe I am spoiling anything when I say Belfort has not really been given, what most of our recently recession minds would consider, a gigantic cross to bear. I believe the mixed reviews you are seeing have a lot to do with the time of release. Most people won't get past the \" These are the clowns that killed the economy\" feeling. The Wolf comes at you hard and doesn't let up. It is a spot-on take of the excess of boiler room bandits. Movie making wise, Scorsese remains a master and his muse DiCaprio brilliant. Another time and another place, maybe I would enjoy it. For me, it was too exhausting. It was excess on the excess. I know it was real to the core, I have met some of the characters. These are empty people. I guess I am just at that stage in life where I want to escape when I go to the movies.

I can't think of a single movie I have watched that I felt like had too much and TOTALLY unnecessary cussing, sex, and drugs but this movie is it.  It is at least an hour too long as well and wastes a ton of time.  This movie isn't about what Jordan Belfort did with stocks and cheating people AT ALL.  I spent the last hour of the movie looking at my watch and had I realized it was 3 hours long I would have left with the third of the theater that got up and walked out within the first hour.",

Martin Scorsese is known for making films to this length, but this didn't work the way Gangs of New York or The Departed did. First of all, Leonardo DiCaprio is the main actor and narrator, and once you get used to his character's sense of humor, it becomes recycled and boring. It almost seems as though he is trying too hard  to represent the wolf that was stock-market giant Jordan Belfort. The movie is an overly-exaggerated version of the actual over-exaggerated life of a scumbag whose only interest was having a lot of fun and even more money.",

Leonardo DiCaprio (who also produced the film) stars as Belfort, with Jonah Hill as his business partner and friend Donnie Azoff, Margot Robbie as his second wife Naomi Lapaglia, and Kyle Chandler as Patrick Denham, the FBI agent who tries to bring him down. Rob Reiner, Jon Bernthal, Jon Favreau, Jean Dujardin, Joanna Lumley, and Matthew McConaughey also feature. The film marks the director's fifth collaboration with DiCaprio, after Gangs of New York (2002), The Aviator (2004), The Departed (2006), and Shutter Island (2010), as well as his second collaboration with Winter after the HBO television series Boardwalk Empire (2010\u201314).",

The dialogue feels so colorful and vibrant, and all the actors deliver an incredible performance.

      "text": "The biggest issue with this movie, which knocked it down from a movie that could have been an 8 or 9 to a 4, was that it was far too long. I really enjoyed the first hour or so of the movie, from Belfort's introduction to the brokerage industry through the creation of Stratton Oakmont and their decision to move away from selling penny stocks solely to lower and middle class folks and instead trying to create relationships (and sell those stocks) to wealthier clients. I enjoyed the initial showing of the opulence, fraud, and craziness that was the Stratton Oakmont at least of Belfort's characterization. But then that portion of the film went on... and on... and on... and it added nothing to the understanding of the characters. I got it at 90 minutes into the film: these were bad men who were willing to do awful things to make themselves as wealthy as possible. The continued at great length portrayals of their awfulness did not make me think they were more awful, but instead took me out of the film and made me so bored that, by the time the action actually picked up again (when Belfort realized he was under investigation, his meeting with the FBI agents, and his move to get his money out of the US), I just couldn't get back into it. The movie could have easily cut a half hour off the run time and I would have felt it would have ended with a better result. For example, I felt the entire IPO Day scene was unnecessary. We already knew Donnie was a jerk, the fish eating/firing scene added nothing. We already knew that, at least according to Belfort, Stratton Oakmont viewed him as a something akin to a cult leader. We didn't need him herding the sheep after Madden tried to speak. That scene also seemed the most hollow and untrue to me in the film.",
