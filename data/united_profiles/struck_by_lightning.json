Allison Janney is wonderful in quite a meaty role, and Rebel Wilson and Angela Kinsey add much needed spark and humour. I find it odd however that Chris Colfer would write himself a mostly unlikable role; pompous, arrogant, and dismissive of what he could learn from others. Is he supposed to be the hero?
