It's not the Hangover that's for sure, infact it's not as good as the Hangover but it is up their this is another awesome comedy from the maestro himself. Robert Downey Jr is absolutely brilliant in this alongside the ever dependable Zach Galafianakis as two men caught in a mix up which leaves Downey stranded and forced to take a roadtrip across America in order for him to get home for the birth of his child. Along the way there are some classic comedy LOL moments as expected but there are also some really great heartfelt and bromance moments. At times its just outrageous but that makes this flick all the better. One word of advice don't expect another Hangover because i'd imagine you might end up disappointed although I don't know how because Due Date has plenty on offer and is another gem from Phillips as the chemistry between Robert Downey Jr and Zach Galifianakis alone is worthy of a watch they are awesome, much like this movie!",

Okay, Downey Jr.'s character can be unlikeable at times and very mean-spirited towards the lovable goofball played to perfection by The Hangover's stand-out comedian, but the situations he is forced to endure are so ridiculous and humiliating I can kind of understand his escalating frustration.

      "text": "\"Due Date\" uses the same template as John Hughes' \"Planes, Trains and Automobiles\", but the template is broken now, and it was a perfectly servicable template, even worse, 1987 called because the yesteryear wants its movie back. 1987 wants to know why every comedy being produced from the major studios pander to the lowest common denominator. \"Planes, Trains and Automobiles\", albeit formulaic through and through the entire running time, was able to telegraph its happy ending without the brazen disregard for plausibility that \"Due Date\" is guilty of. Peter Highman(Robert Downey Jr.) is such a city mouse, the a**hole of a city mouse, the filmmaker should just let him be, without having to worry about redeeming him, especially since he's teamed up with a country mouse, the a**hole of a country mouse, who doesn't seem like the same character after both men are asked to leave the plane. At the drop-off area, Ethan Trembly(Zach Galifinakas) is inscrutable; he makes eye contact with Peter, a nonchalance that seems exceedingly bold, coming so soon after the car he arrived in, ripped off the door of the architect's taxi. Later, while both men are standing together curbside, Ethan knocks over Peter's luggage and resigns himself from the common courtesy of picking it up. Once on the plane, Ethan walks to his seat as if the 747 was a yacht he personally owned, placing his carry-on luggage in the overhead compartment  without the slightest acknowledgement that he's fat and an owner of a hirsute belly, haphazardly concealed within a buttoned shirt, aligned strategically with Peter's face, a magnet, as it turns out. \"Due Date\" would have been a whole lot fresher had both men remained formidable opponents, but once they hit the road, the relationship turns hierarchical, in which Ethan stops playing \"dumb\", and Peter asserts himself as the sophisticate who doesn't suffer fools gladly. The words and actions that Peter unleashes on Ethan are so hurtful, so rooted in class consciousness, they practically blow away the \"Planes, Trains and Automobiles\" template to smithereens. The architect's contempt for the budding actor seems just too intense, going so far, at one point, as telling the \"Two and a Half Men\" enthusiast that he despises him \"on a cellular level\". On another occasion, Peter slams Ethan's permed head on a truck, almost hard enough to cause a concussion. In the 1987 John Hughes classic, Neal Page(Steve Martin) may have disliked his accidental companion immensely, but his aversion for Del(John Candy) never coalesced into full-blown hatred. It was John Hughes at his best that the moviegoer didn't mutter to himself, \"Yeah, right,\" when Neal invites the big lug over for Thanksgiving dinner. The late Hughes was a humanist with a pragmatic touch. With its over-reliance on a masturbating dog and drug-related humor for laughs, \"Due Date\" should have played off the sentimental tropes found in \"Planes, Trains and Automobiles\" rather than recast them in such a vulgarian context. It's hard to believe Peter when he says, \"I love you,\" to his fellow traveller, not after Peter spit in Ethan's dog's face and mocks the Arkansasian man for having the rube dream of making it big in Hollywood. He doesn't care about other people. The filmmaker establishes this fact early in the film, as Peter ignores the friendly driver who tries to engage him in a conversation during their jaunt to the airport. We get it. Peter only talks to people he deems worthwhile. A car figures in a later scene, where Peter has second thoughts about ditching his \"friend\" after forgetting to throw out the coffee can containing Ethan's father's ashes. Neal Page would turn around and go back, not Peter Highman, but he turns around anyway, because that's the formula, the steady progression from antagonists to friends, culminating in the scene at the Grand Canyon, where Peter seems exceedingly sensitive while encouraging Ethan to honor his father's last wish, and say goodbye. This is total bulls*it. It feels forced. This loser means nothing to him. But a formula is a formula, which makes you realize how a film like \"Planes, Trains and Automobile\" covers its tracks much better than \"Due Date\", a funny enough film that might have benefited even more had Ethan been allowed to be Peter's sparring partner, not whipping boy. That's the movie we see in the set-up. Interestingly enough, the sparring partner makes a cameo, soon after Ethan gets roughed up by Peter, when a loaded gun that the actor(remember: he's an actor) finds in the glove compartment, accidentally, of course, goes off, and hits the abusive architect in the leg. It's a taste of what \"Due Date\" could have been, and might have been in the original draft: a dark road comedy.",

Robert Downey Jr. and Zach Galifianakis wasn't half bad in the movie but in a different way that those two guys weren't much funny and I get complaint about Downey Jr for putting him in a so so movie with Zach in it. They have arguments the whole time and the lines aren't there yet (not to The Hangover funny lines). But there's Zach Galifianakis has three funny lines in the middle with spitting the dog line,the truck back line,and the waffles line,which we save him in this picture. But the movie slows down with lack that it refers to the Planes,Trains,and Automobile and it's nothing interesting with the whole cast that actually missing in the movie. But this comedy wasn't worthing to the classic of Road Trip,Old School,and the best box-office winner of The Hangover. You could probably stick to the John Hughes film of Planes,Trains,and Automobiles that it's more funny and it has hearts to those beloved actors of Steve Martin and John Candy at the same time,but this new one wasn't much special and I'm really sorry with those two actors in the movie like that,but it's a least bad you can tell.",

Whoever did not like this movie does not have a sense of humor. GO SEE THIS MOVIE!!",

Though I must say the title sort of threw me off a bit. It's called Due Date, yet the movie was more in a road trip situation. Robert Downy Jr. and Zach Galifianakis are really a one of a kind pair. Together, playing total opposite roles, make this one to enjoy from start to end.",

Although the chemistry (or rather counter-chemistry) between the two leaders doesn't match up with their oft-compared counterparts Steve Martin and John Candy of Planes, Trains and Automobiles, Due Date does win in the laugh out loud category. The film achieves that rare feat of  completely destroying those touching moments, without angering the viewer.",

But unlike John Candy, Zack's character had no redeeming qualities. He was not lovable at all. The two main characters had no chemistry. Why is chemistry so hard for directors to see?  Clearly I'm not the target audience, but even so just not very well done. Mostly gross gags and alot of meanness.  It's the first time in a long time I've watched a movie where I could tell they were acting. Even good actors can have bad material. Maybe they just got lost in the editing process. Just a bad movie.",
