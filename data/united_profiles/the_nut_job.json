The Nut Job is plagued by the typical problems children\u2019s films face such as two-dimensional characters, bad jokes, and a unoriginal story. The writers half-ass that department as expected but unlike some films which have decent/really good animation to make up for it (ex. The Lorax, Free Birds) the animation is awful. This film isn\u2019t Foodfight level of bad as nothing in here is offensive or obnoxious and young children may be mildly entertained by the film but is upsetting to see a studio release something in theaters without putting any effort into it. The film is of such low quality that it doesn\u2019t deserve a theatrical release and should\u2019ve gone straight to DVD where most low quality films are sent. Even then its not something that is worth sitting through. I feel bad for all the parents who had to sit through this film and shudder at the thought that this film is getting a sequel.",

      "text": "It's no Over the Hedge, but it's still a fairly entertaining movie about animals stealing food. I think kids will find it enjoyable, and I see no reason why parents would hate it. Yes it's not up to the quality of a Pixar or DreamWorks animated movie, but I do not believe in will make older audiences miserable. The movie has got a great voice cast full of some big name actors. The animation is pretty bad though, as the human characters and backgrounds just look gross. The animals actually look pretty good, but it's often hard to notice that given how ugly the world around them is. As far as humor and story goes, both are up to snuff and are entertaining enough to keep you engaged, even if neither are particularly revolutionary. I do feel it can be surprisingly violent though, and not in a slapstick sort of way. It can almost seem mean at times. All in all it's a decent animated kids movie that I do not feel will make viewers miserable in any way. Kids are most likely going to get quite a few laughs out of it, and adults shouldn't have to worry about staying awake through it.",
