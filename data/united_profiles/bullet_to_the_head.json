Almost the entirety of Bullet to the Head is cliches and while they irritate the film does have some thrills to it. The action is good, not great but its got a certain charm, the film uses profanity properly, it actually feels like it belongs and these two characters meld well meaning the cheesy dialogue does provide a few laughs although the script is filled with unnatural dialogue delivered by actors who can clearly tell its dreadful. The supporting cast is awful with Christian Slater continuing his slow journey to obscurity and Jason Momoa playing a unintentionally hilarious sadist.

Sylvester Stallone plays his typical BA role and Sung Kang continues to emerge as a potential star on the rise. I also loved the addition, though small, of Sarah Shahi. I really hope she starts to get some bigger roles because she is a fantastic actress and has such a unique and exotic look. The flaws in the movie were pretty major though. The plot development was frantic and sort of a mess and the element of Kang's character being ignorant to the police's involvement seemed kind of silly considering how obvious is was to the audience and even the rest of the characters in the film. The gun play was also horrendous. How many movies are going to use the silencer in this unrealistic fashion? It's really getting old. I also thought Sly's character was a little over the top. It's tough to \"root for\" a protagonist that you can't stand and his character was a bit too much of a jerk to get in his corner. On a slightly off-topic note, I find it ironic that Stallone has opined against guns and the 2nd amendment but then makes movies like this where there are criminals and crooked cops left and right. Talk about hypocrisy. Back to the point though, this was a decent movie that had some entertainment value but nothing more really.",

Stallone plays Jimmy Bobo, a fearless assassin who kills his targets and in this movie we are totally unaware if he's working on his own demands or if he's a contracted killer with a boss. He poses another action flick with not much excitement to promise. The only decent actor is Sung Kang, who plays a detective called Taylor Kwon: a cop who associates with Bobo as they attempt to track down and take out the killer, played by Jason Momoa. Their relationship in this particular case is hard to bear and they might as well have killed each other to save the bother of working together. Bobo also has a daughter who appears in bits of the movie and she's a tattooist who mostly tattoos herself and makes her look ridiculous.",
