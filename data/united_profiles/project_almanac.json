The plot is so cliche but what these kids were good at doing is acting like how normal teenagers would if they found out about a time travel device. There is a bunch of awful dialogue in the movie and a concert scene that goes on for far too long. I had low hopes going into this movie but I walked out disappointed. Such a shame",
