Jesse is a naive 35 year old college graduate that we're supposed to find charming and intelligent, but I found him irritating.  The supporting cast seemed more genuine in their humanity than he did.  Jesse was more like the idea of a man than an actual one.  So, I'm left with mixed feelings about this film.  Elizabeth Olsen's character was fun to watch.  In fact, she is more of a leading character in this movie than Jesse could ever hope to be.",
