She did it in Heavenly Creatures, she did it in 2 1/2 Men, and she does it here.  The problem is that the writing isn't brilliant, and there's just not enough to it.  She had a bad marriage, her parents have a bad marriage, and life sucks.  The young love interest - the guy from HBO's \"Girls\" is sorely out of his league - they could have cast that role so much more succesfully.",
