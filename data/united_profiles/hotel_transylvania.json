Kids like monsters. Especially overactive ones. That's exactly what this movie is. An overactive stay in a hotel for monsters. No humans allowed! The story is simple and predictable. Also the all-star cast isn't necessary. Mostly because the strength isn't the voice acting. It's the animations, the fun and kinda dumb characters and the tempo which makes the movie fun to watch.

It is bright and colorful, has likeable characters, and some great humor. The film has some clich\u00e9s but there is nothing terrible in here. If I had kids I would not mind showing this film at all. Enough of the humor works in this movie and is not dumb humor so adults will get through it ok. In short if you have kids and you want something bright, colorful, and funny to show them show them this. Hotel Transylvania is definitely the most upbeat of the three Halloween movies of 2012 but it is also the weakest because it is mainly for kids whereas the others were darker and had some more adult moments. However as kid\u2019s films go its ok. If you are a little kid you\u2019ll probably enjoy this one but if you are going into this movie expecting something at the same level as Dexter\u2019s Laboratory or Samurai Jack you\u2019ll probably be disappointed because this film is not even close to being on the same level it\u2019s just a little kids films with enough laughs to make it watchable.",
