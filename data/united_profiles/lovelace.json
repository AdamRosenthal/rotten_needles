      "text": "Linda Lovelace (Amanda Seyfried) was the most famous porn star and her movie \"Deep Throat\" was the biggest grossing XXX ever. This biopic starts with the passionate, wide-eyed, exciting version of her story, but switches halfway thru to reveal the truth: her husband (Peter Sarsgaard) pimped her out and abused her. This dark and unfortunate film has a strong cast (Sharon Stone & Robert Patrick have the most touching scenes as her parents) and lots of garish '70s style. While it's relentlessly cruel, it never conjures up much sympathy. It's an over-the-top biopic that's more instructional than emotional.",

However, the plot is a little messy and the story tends to ignore some important facts about her life--and, in doing so, made the film feel more like a collection of short stories from Lovelace's journey than the actual story.  But the subject material is interesting and the performances are strong.  As a drama, it's great.  As a bio-pic, it's okay.",

      "text": "Unlike the year's earlier 'The Look of Love', which also dealt with a porn industry icon, Lovelace is actually  very informative if a somewhat sanitised and one sided depiction of events in the life of Linda Lovelace of  Deep Throat  fame. At a modest  93 minutes there is a lot to pack in and at times scenes seem to end with an exclamation mark to lead us succinctly in to the next chapter of L L's life. The film is very well served by its actors. Amanda Seyfried has never before given such an accomplished performance, but that being so she is still eclipsed by Peter Sarsgaard as her husband Chuck Traynor who, as painted here, is very much the villain of the piece. Sarsgaard is breath takingly brilliant and steals the acting honours from a strong line up of character actors with some ease. An unrecognizable Sharon Stone also registers strongly in support as Linda's down trodden mum and the choice of soundtrack and costumes fit the period to perfection. All in all this is a much better movie than I expected given the luke warm reviews and, on reflection, I feel that it has been rather under rated.",

I could have liked more if the movie would have the original cast Kate Hudson and James Franco as planned instead Amanda Seyfried. Nonetheless, it is a cool movie about a true story.
