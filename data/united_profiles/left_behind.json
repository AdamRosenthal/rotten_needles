This book is suppose to be about the apocalypse. How did it get to be about Nicholas Cage piloting a plane and the peoples reactions  and about Cassi Thompson saving the plane and just a little about the rapture. Firstly Cassi Thompson as Chloe Steele was grossly misrepresented and Nicholas Cage as Rayford Steele was laughable the state of shock he was in for the entire movie was hilarious. My advice for anyone watching this movie, read the books you'll enjoy them more. Movie was poorly made, poorly taught out, should have stuck to the book it would have made the movie Epic!.

      "text": "This is another movie where users know more than critics. Of course, we users go to the movies because we enjoy them as long as they are entertaining. We're not there to criticize and dissect. So I'm starting to think I might just have to read what the users have to say and they were right about \"Left Behind.\" It's not a movie to be taken seriously, however, it had a lot of serious thoughts about religion in it. I also think it had funny moments that were not intentional, but that often happens in movies that are trying to be too serious, and it makes the movie better. I saw the \"Exorcist\" and everyone was laughing the whole way through the movie. Good thing because I was scared to death watching it. \"Left Behind\" had its moments of scariness, humor and absurdity. The acting was fine. However, at times some of the acting was way exaggerated for the scene, which means, it's the director's fault. Like the actors would be really scared, then calm down too quick in the next scene even though the problem is getting worse. That's not bad acting, that's bad directing and bad editing. But we still liked the movie. We try to go to all the religious movies that make you think, not the ones that praise religion. But we especially like the religious movies with action (The Matrix had a lot of religious undertones). Boyfriend is a believer, I'm not sure if I am, but I used to be. So we saw the movie with different mind frames and still enjoyed it because it showed how different people are about religion. I'd be like Nicholas Cage. Give me a sign and I'm believing again. The only cheesy part of the movie was when the daughter cleared a \"runway\" with a truck for her father to land a crippled plane full of scared people. Yet I thought it was very creative and resourceful how they used the cell phone to locate one another. I'll have to remember that next time I'm lost with no landmarks, like people who get lost in the woods. Of course, you have to have cell phone reception for it to work. The movie is not perfect. It is what it should be. Makes you think while it entertains.",
