However, this film isn't all too bad. It's a light hearted comedy, with some good jokes, some bad jokes, and some copied jokes (There's a scene completely copied off a Mr Bean episode!). But it wasn't too bad. The Holly/Greg story that I was hooked into remained and, although it wasn't completely resolved, they ended the film and the story with finesse. Although I warn you, the opening and ending bits with human Greg standing in front of a cartoon background is the cheesiest thing ever, but you can forget that. Overall It's not the worst film of the year *Cough* Abe Lincoln Vampire Hunter *Cough* but if you are looking for a comedy with great constant gags, It's not the film for you.",
