However, everyone else will probably be uninterested and/or bored as the film has little to offer. The story lacks any real substance and has a poorly constructed ending, the characters are not that interesting with the only interesting ones being interesting more for the actor voicing them then the character themselves, and the film doesn\u2019t deliver in the comedy department as much as it should. However, I can\u2019t hate this film as it didn\u2019t get under my skin or make me role my eyes. The film gave me some amusement but also some shallow righting so it falls in the middle with me neither disliking nor hating the film. Check it out if you are interested but if you don\u2019t care I don\u2019t blame you if you skip it as this film doesn\u2019t have much to offer anyone outside of little kids.",
