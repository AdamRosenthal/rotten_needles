But then Kramer detoured for the completely earnest (and awful) immigration drama Crossing Over, which proves a point: Kramer isn't going over the top for any honest, organic reason but rather as a cold, calculated exercise. It's the same with PAWN SHOP CHRONICLES, though this time he and screenwriter Adam Minarovich very obviously draw their empty inspiration from Pulp Fiction. So the movie is crazy and agitated and loud and full of left turns  and, yes, over-the-top  but these things don't add up to anything that could be called a good movie. There are a couple of shock-based laughs early on, but then the laughs dry up, as do the thrills and the tingles. It's just horrifying and soul-deadening. All of that said, D'Onofrio gives a very interesting performance as the slightly befuddled pawn shop proprietor.",

The main idea is that one cannot go out of his boundaries and what life gives him is what he deserves. The psycho-husband who wants justice all for his own benefit, ends tragically, killed by his own goal. The greedy ones, impersonated by meth-addicts, get killed by their aim  having all, ignoring the consequences of their acts. And \"The King\", left alone and dumped by his own material life, leaves himself in the hands of faith  the moralizing end. The purpose of this movie is to scream out loud that some things must be left how they are. All those philosophic ideas, mixed-up with a great cast, create maybe one of the greatest stories of this decade. A bit sloppy here and there, but hey, you can't please everybody as well as nobody can be pleased enough.

If you like Pulp Fiction, watching this will drive you mad as you will notice/recognize key elements brazenly ripped off.  It strings together seemingly unconnnected storylines  into a story. Just as Pulp Fiction, in this some of the storylines more interesting than others-certainly more humorous. Walker was good but his appearance short. Unfortunatly Frasier seems to get most of the play in the 2nd half of the movie which makes this movie even worse.",
