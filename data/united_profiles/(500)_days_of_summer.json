Unfortunately, the script writer appears to have not spend enough time researching social philosophy on that topic (f.i. writings of Erich Fromm). Thereafter, the movie misses to make a clear distinction between infatuation and real love/earnest friendship. Furthermore, it completely leaves out the possibility that two people really just might have to work together and have some tolerance for each others flaws. Rather \"(500) Days of Summer\" suggests that love is something totally random and that a relationship either works perfectly or simply not. Because of this, the \"(500) Days of Summer\" contributes to keeping alive the fairy tale idea that there is one - and only one - perfect lover in the world for each single person. Nevertheless, the movie does a good job on one of its other goals, which is to encourage the viewer to not follow the trend of striving for quick money, but to follow one's real passion by bringing it to the center of one's life. Lastly, \"(500) Days of Summer\" is good filmmaking, tastefully combining romance, drama, and short scenes amplifying emotions of the protagonists like a funny musical interlude or beautiful 2-D animation.",

All we know is that the relationship is over and there is nothing we can do about it they have moved on so should we however, that is sometimes easier said that done. Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt)   knows this all too well as h e has just broken up with his loveless, girlfriend Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel). He is wreck after there break-up  he has lost his kind nature  and feels disjointed and lost in the world like he  has had his heart ripped out and had her do the Mexican hat dance all over it. Tom is depressed and lonely but thanks to his friends (Geoffrey Arend and Matthew Gray Gubler) and an extraordinarily smart little girl who seems to be an expert on relationships (Chloe Moretz). Tom looks back on the 500 days of his relationship with Summer trying to find out what went wrong and what he could have done differently if he only had a second chance.    There is a scene of dialogue that opens this film stating, \"This is not a love story, this is a story about love\" and that is the entire basis for this film story. This is not a love story a love story is where you see a sequences of events and happenings that lead two people to find one another. Then in a big mush climax they admit there love for one another  while the poignant and very sappy music plays in the background  while the girl finally finds her knight in shining armor or the boy finally finds his princess. It is a tried and rundown formula that has plagued the romance genre for the last 30 years,  now here we are  in the 21st century and we still get these sappy and at some points very cringe inducing conclusions to these clich\u00c3\u00a9 love stories that makes audiences scoff, scoff because they have seen it hundreds thousands of times before. \"(500) Days of Summer\u00e2",

The editing style was amazing and we've seen this with Marc Webb's music videos (REF: Move Along, Bad Day & 21 Guns). He loves experimenting with different editing styles and it paid off.

I think thiz is the best modern romantic drama since ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND (2004). The couple played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel. We see Gordon-Levitt recently in G.I. JOE: RISE OF COBRA (2009). The Director is Marc Webb. The chemistry of Gordon-Levitt and Deschanel was very well. The characters seem so easy-going and believable. The movie fills with good music as well, to describe the high and low of love. The movie simply brings us into the mood of love easily, where sometimes fill with laugh and joy, and the other times with hesitation and sadness. In several of scenes, they keep asking each other, where this relationship goes to? If you love somebody that just happens and you can tell her anytime, anywhere, do not care where the place it is. Maybe do not that simple, but we know even love does not last forever, but commitment does. The ending is far from idealistic, but more close to reality. Like I said many times before, if you want to make a great love story, you cannot have the couple stay together in the ending. You can see thiz element from ROMEO AND JULIET to TITANIC and other similar love stories. The essential of love is the moments we ever had.

Everyone goes on parading something that they feel, and love, when truly it is something they don't quite understand yet, and these are driven by simple infatuations or a blind emotion devoted to not seeing the truth as it is presented. Many of us are in relationships we don't understand, but we still go at it. Why? The movie presents this remarkably well and tells the consequences in flashback sequences.

You quickly fall in love with Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) ever since the beginning. You see Summer (Zooey Deschanel) as such the nice lovely lady and that's exactly what she is. You begin to feel extremely compassionate for Tom when things begin to not go his way. The film takes you through a series of 500 days, hence the title. It jumps back and forth between days at the beginning and towards the end of the relationship showing when things were going good and then when things began to get sour. At times they would show the same circumstances at the beginning and end of the relationship and the noticeable differences. This is a fantastic film anyone who appreciates good film.",

I like both of the actors, but their cute looks gave me more a sense of confusion between seriousness and cheerfulness. Was it supposed to be this confusing, or does this genuinely try and portray complications within a relationship, if you could call what they were going through a relationship?

It's not the usual romantic comedy as there's nothing dumb about it. Yes, you do get a happy ending, but not the one you'd expect. Highly recommend.",

It also teaches you a lot about life, about people and about relationships and I am certain that it will be a hot topic amongst your friends, as per the moral evaluation of Summer and... the guy JGL's playing (I keep forgetting his name - was it Tom?). I'm certain each of us had such an experience, both male and female, and it was, for me at leas, certainly lovely to see how things can turn out and I learned a lot as it really broadened my perspective and showed me clear signs of potential problems that I can now avoid.

This is an offbeat, hilarious, untraditional romantic comedy that doesn't offer a fantasy, but instead shows how fantasy and expectations are always higher than reality, and there is a clever scene that uses a split-screen to show Tom's expectations and reality at the same time.
