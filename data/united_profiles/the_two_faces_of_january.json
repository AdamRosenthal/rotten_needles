L\u00e1stima que pronto todo se vuelve muy plano y mon\u00f3tono hasta que la intriga pr\u00e1cticamente desaparece. La lucha entre los dos protagonistas se vuelve tediosa y el papel de Dunst es casi anecd\u00f3tico. Una pel\u00edcula un poco pobre.",

Characters are manipulative, morally ambiguous and have pathology tendency for deceit. However, it's irritatingly slow on creating tension and the script is rather thin even for the average runtime of the movie. The flamboyant visual is just barely enough to keep interest till the end.",

      "text": "As a whole, The Two Faces of January is a pretty good film. It is a touch slow, but I never thought its pacing was particularly bad or anything, plus the reward, to me, was ultimately worth it. Though, even if the ending was not as good as it was, it still would have been worth it due to the stellar cinematography in this one, as well as the great acting from Viggo Mortensen, Kirsten Dunst, and Oscar Isaac. In regard to the former, it really is a very sleek and sexy film to look at, true eye candy. I just loved the look and feel of this one and it was beautifully crafted. The writing was alright, nothing to write home about, but it certainly got the job done. At times, it certainly feels like a watered down film from Alfred Hitchcock and if this one had a bit more about it, it would have been better, but as it stands, I did enjoy it and thought it was a solid little film.",

      "text": "The Two Faces of January is a psychological thriller adapted from a novel by American writer Patricia Highsmith. Previous adaptations of her work include Strangers On A Train (1951) by Alfred Hitchcock, and The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999) by the late Academy Award winner Anthony Minghella. After a significant but fluctuating career as screenwriter (The Four Feathers, Drive, Snow White And The Huntsman), Hossein Amini takes on a challenging task for his directorial debut, proving that his skills can compete with Minghella\u2019s and with the Master of Supense\u2019s himself. Amini conveys the complex aspects of human behaviour typical of the finest thrillers in a surprisingly powerful way: he sharply outlines atmospheres, characters and situations, harmoniously blending them together in a remarkable, intriguing drama.",
