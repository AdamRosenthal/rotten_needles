But I liked the hyper angst of her character -- smart, but somewhat handicapped by being in the generation who were told they were Special ever since preschool. With just enough input from the gently cliched supporting characters, we see her acquire a little pain and a little wisdom ... and unless you're heartless, you'll probably find yourself hoping she's gonna be OK.",

Its main flaw is the loose directing which lets actors and scenes flow in a freewheeling fashion that lacks discipline.

However, we have a wonderful main actress here who positively shines in her role, the widely ambitious poetry lover who is just learning about the 'adult world'. Cusack continues his tradition of choosing indie roles with a bit of bite and originality and plays the role of disillusioned poet with skill - if Hollywood doesn't exactly love him there are plenty of seasoned movie fans who do.",
