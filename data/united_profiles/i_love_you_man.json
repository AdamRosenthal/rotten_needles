He feels that, throughout his life, he has never had an individual that he could call his best friend, so he takes it upon himself to find one. After many failed attempts at finding a guy to call his pal, he gives up and ends up meeting Sydney Fife (Segel). Hilarity ensues. Now, I'm gonna' start off by saying that when Paul Rudd and Jason Segel first start to hang out with one another, it is one of the most awkward friendships I've ever seen. It's still funny, but hard to watch at times. After this awkward phase though, the chemistry between Rudd and Segel really starts to shine, and then the laughs begin to roll in. At this point, the writing really starts to pick up as well. Also, the band \"Rush\" was used as a plot device for the film - I found this to be extremely unique and it was awesome to see Rudd and Segel's characters bond over their music. With a solid script, unforgettable chemistry between it's leads, and a memorable premise, \"I Love You, Man\" makes for an amazing comedy that I won't soon forget.",

The way they meet is very funny, and Paul Rudd's girlfriend pushing him to go out makes for a very funny scene. All of the scenes where the characters are just hanging out and having fun are very light-hearted and make you feel good. I also very much appreciated how the movie truly focused on the bromance, and not too much on Rudd's relationship. The movie seemed very real, and there were no boring parts. Excellent, I recommend viewing.",

      "text": "I Love You, Man has done the impossible- it has surpassed the last great comedy of this Apatow-controlled era, Forgetting Sarah Marshall (if by only a narrow margin), and has cemented itself in history as one of the funniest movies I have ever had the pleasure of seeing. What makes this film stand out so much amidst an array of other excellent funny movies? For one, there is a character relationship dynamic in this film that is unrivaled in any other comedy- a relationship that is, weirdly, best compared to the rapport between the leads in any rom com. You see, while this film is not technically a romantic comedy per se, it is most definitely the very definition of a bromance film. Not since Fight Club has there been a stranger friendship between two men than there is between Sydney Fefe (Jason Segel) and Peter Klaven (Paul Rudd). As the movie starts to build up speed and Sydney is brought into the mix, this film takes off and runs with the admittedly thin premise. Literally, the latter three-quarters of the film revolve around the trials and tribulations of being in a bromantic relationship\u00e2",

Have you ever watched a movie thinking \"Ok, this is just the intro - we'll get to the good part soon\" and then you look at Time Played and it's been over an hour? This is that type of movie. 'Spoiler' part: There are some moments where you would expect the friend to bail, resetting the protagonist's plight to finding a friend for the wedding to prevent it being awkward (this premise alone is incredibly soppy and infantile, but we'll roll with it) but no, the trainwreck continues. Will he murder the protagonist? Nope! Will he bail after borrowing the money? Nope! Instead, he spent it on billboards. \"Well, that's somewhat realistic, now we're getting somewhere!\" the audience is thinking, \"because now he probably won't pay the guy back, gets mad because he doesn't feel appreciated\" but no, ofcourse not... The billboards do eventually pan out, the guy gets the girl, the other guy gets the guy/guy gets the other guy as a friend and we all live merrily ever after. Now don't get me wrong: I don't mind rom-com flicks when done right, but I would strongly suggest to avoid this unless you want to watch a BAD movie. It reminds me of 30 Minutes Or Less, or some other forgettable title where the protagonists are 1 dimensional, invincible and most of all frustratingly ignorant people who just waddle through the movie from start till finish. Again: this can also be done right, as these titles prove: Blue Mountain State, American Pie, Road Trip etc.",
