The parkour is excellent, the sense of vibe and energy fills the screen with great action and parkour skills. David Belle is on the top of his game. But, if you have watched District 13, there is actually no point in seeing Brick Mansions. Sure, it has some great action and parkour but the exact same story, same twists, some bad acting- ESPECIALLY RZA. Director Camille Delamarre just wanted a washed out version of the great original by Pierre Morel. The acting and the friendship of Belle and Walker plays out well with great acting by the duo. But RZA makes the movie fall though, his character- a coward boss of Brick Mansions slows down the movie on its great potential. The stunts are great but there is no sense it Brick Mansions it feels like a straight-to-dvd movie if it weren't for Paul Walker. One time watch for fans, but really do you want to see District 13 again in theatres, with washed out story and screenplay? Take that in mind before buying tickets for the movie.

R.I.P. Paul Walker. I felt that Brick Mansions feels too short of a remake of the cult classic \"District B13 (Banlieue 13 in French).\" The good news is that Paul and David Belle did some incredible moves and backflips and it was awesome. The bad news is that director Camille Delamarre and producer Luc Besson of La Femme Nikita fame has really made the film look difficult and sometimes it's hard to understand why you want to remake a 10-year-old French classic. But the script feels weak, I don't know about RZA's performance. It's a so-so but blatant effort and Besson, however, has too much pressure on what's his next goal and hopefully he could fail another movie. Even though it's hard to put Paul Walker on that role, but I think Brick Mansions is a \"thanks, but no thanks\" good but betrayed movie of the year.",

We all know the plot makes no sense and is no more than thinly veiled set up for the action sequences. I left before the end and only stayed that long because I bought a large popcorn.",

However, it still manages to be one of those kinds of movies where it's so stupid and ridiculous that it's somewhat fun to watch. That's how I felt about this film overall. Unfortunately, there's little to no plot in this film. Paul Walker gives a worthwhile performance in his second to last role (Fast and Furious 7 is his final next year.) David Belle pretty much plays the exact same character he did in the original District B13. RZA tried, but made for a rather wooden and undeveloped antagonist. Overall, it's wreckless, but slightly entertaining at the same time. As long as you go in expecting some entertaining action and nothing more, you won't be too disappointed.",

The banlieue movies are one of my favorites, so brick mansions felt more like a bad deja-vu than an interesting new interpretation. Banlieue 13 has way more style and more important, with raffaelli, belle had an equal skilled partner; cause Walker as a fighter is just **** he looks better behind the wheel- or not. Without the comparison to the original movie, i would\u00b4ve rated it higher because it\u00b4s a nice little, diverting movie",

I wonder what legal issues that represents...as the original is still out there for sale in the big stores like HMV. The remake was a good film-but it wasn't anything different than the original. I would have thought that filmmakers would rather come up with new ideas so they don't have to pay royalties to other producers for using their work as a basis for a \"new\" film. There has been a lot of that lately-Robocop was redone-and the original was also American-and then recently there was a US version of  The Girl With The Dragon tattoo in 2011, a scant two years after the Swedish movie by the same name was made. I don't think there is much you can really say about Brick Mansion's other than it contains Paul Walker who is now no longer with us. The film is OK if you are stuck for something to see or are just curious about the remake. Whats next I wonder-remakes of remakes? They should try to bring new idea to the screen and stop relying on things other contemporary filmmakers have done, in order to sell tickets.",
