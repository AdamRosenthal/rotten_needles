It starts with the typical \"everything you see in this movie is real documented footage and blah blah\" Of course most of the audience watching knows this isn't true, so I don't really know why the directors bother to put something like that in movies in the first place anymore. I guess it's used in an attempt to immerse the crowd watching the movie but after awhile it just starts feeling silly. To my disappointment, most of the movie wasn't shown in full screen. This is obviously due to the supposed cameras used back in the 70's, imitated by the director to further have the crowd believe everything seen is real. It's just disappointing to go to the theater and see the movie not take full advantage of the screen. The length of the movie was a bit on the short side and most of the people watching seemed bored out of their minds until the last half of the movie. I feel that the start of the movie had the plot moving to fast, which sort of made for a rough start. The plot wasn't exactly stellar either, it was pretty generic in the sense that you have astronauts out in space, encountering alien life forms and somehow getting \"infected\" by them, like seriously guys? How many times do we have to see this same old plot re-used? Despite the movies flaws, it did have it's moments, specifically the moments where it would make you jump in fear. The acting was good, the special effects were great for the budget it had and by the end of the movie I was satisfied with what I've seen. We watch movies for enjoyment and this movie gave me enough enjoyment to feel that I got my monies worth.",

The actors really have no dialogue outside of their work, meaning we know basically nothing about them, so there is no connection with the audience.

If you aren't already a fan of the \"found-footage\" genre, APOLLO 18 is unlikely to change that fact, but for anyone who enjoys watching in horror through the shaky first-person perspective of the camera will find this to be another fresh new take on the format. Director Gonzalo L\u00f3pez-Gallego has taken great care in making every scene feel authentic by properly aging the footage and dressing down the technology to fit the early 1970's. The cramped space station and craterous moon setting add the the believability, and allow for a suspension of disbelief as we travel alongside the cosmonauts in zero-gravity. While this particular style does lend credibility to the plot, it is also cause for a lot of expected slow-downs in the pace, with the action being spread thin throughout the entire run-time. Fear and paranoia do set in much like in THE THING once the men discover that there is life on other worlds. An interesting use of the format to be sure, APOLLO 18 nevertheless reaches the limit of its own high concept quickly as the audience eagerly awaits any signs of life from the film. -Carl Manes",

      "text": "The idea that aliens are the reason that we've never gone back to the Moon is a relatively interesting one to me, and it seems like it would make a rather unique and effective horror movie. Apollo 18 attempts to put this conspiracy theory to film to disappointingly pitiful results. Apollo 18 suggests that the canceled Apollo 18 mission did actually land on the Moon, but it never returned for unknown reasons. The film is shot in the found-footage style, which is supposedly the lost footage from that mission. The crew of the Apollo 18 find evidence of extraterrestrial life on the moon and realize the real reason they were sent to the Moon. The Moon setting certainly makes this movie unique and makes the film rather unsettling, but that is the only creepy or memorable about this lazy and dull found footage schlock. Apollo 18 is actually rather entertaining for the first 20 or so minutes, as we hear strange, otherworldly sounds coming from outside the ship. It's very reminiscent of The Blair Witch Project, until the reveal of the aliens. They don't have much screen time, but when you do see them, it completely ruins the sense of mystery and becomes just another alien horror flick. The first sighting of the extraterrestrials ruined a potentially creepy and memorable scene in which one of the astronauts is screaming that something is \"moving around in his helmet.\" That's also where the movie takes a huge nose-dive and transforms into a generic body-horror film. What makes the movie even more insufferable is the incredibly bland writing. None of the characters have an sort of personality, and the dialog couldn't be any more uninteresting unless Ben Stein was delivering the lines. Apollo 18 could have been the science-fiction equivalent to The Blair Witch Project or Paranormal Activity, but instead is just another tedious and uninspired shaky-cam headache.",

      "text": "Riffing off the current hype of found footage movies, Apollo 18 fails to build any of the suspense of tension that earlier instalments, such as The Blair Witch Project and Cloverfield, had in abundance. What we get instead is ninety minutes of not a lot. It takes plenty of time to get going, then nothing really happens, and then it ends. It feels overly drawn out considering it is a short movie but what it should be is a fifteen minute short movie that really nails the premise. There is potential. During one scene the film felt claustrophobic despite being set in the vastness of space. This is a feat that suggested greater things to come and despite the odd jump it doesn't bring anything good let alone great. There is nothing to the characters giving any emotional appeal or empathy to their plight. Maybe this is because their situation is one we will never find ourselves in?! As the film plods on there are no great escapes, no dices with death, no challenge for our characters to overcome, meaning we are left with something rather dull. The story could work however the found footage idea and the lack of depth suggest this shouldn't be a cinema release and instead a short movie watched online.",
