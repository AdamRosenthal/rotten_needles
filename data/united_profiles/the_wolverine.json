      "text": "While watching The Wolverine, I was reminded of another Marvel movie, Spider-Man 2. The two films showed how the powers given to our heroes effect them. But in Spider-Man 2 unlike The Wolverine, this story is well explored and done. In Spider-Man 2 there's an actual struggle. Peter wants to be with Mary Jane and not disappoint her all the time. However, at the same time the city needs him. He thinks back to what Uncle Ben told him about \"With great power, comes great responsibility.\" In The Wolverine, the story is done horribly. We're showed why Logan doesn't want to be immortal anymore which links back to X-Men: The Last Stand. Even with that it feels vague and forced because we are constantly reminded. Going back to there being no struggle, at a certain point in the movie Logan decides it's time to get his powers back. I mean it's makes sense, since Mariko was kidnapped. But it all felt half-baked. Now I know it's unfair to compare it to Spider-Man 2. Now I'll just go ahead and look at the movie for what it's trying to accomplish. The movie started out promising. The scene where Logan saves Yashida and the beginning showing him as a drifter laid interesting groundwork. The scene where everyone is attending Yashida's funeral is where things really started to slide. From there we fallow Logan's and Mariko's relationship which is incredibly forced. After a few scenes of them just interacting, they arrive at a home of Mariko's. Then they fall in love like that. The movie concludes with Mariko being kidnapped and Logan has to get his powers back to save. The final act of this movie is one big mess. A lot of the time you're going, really? Especially with the final plot twist. Some of this has to do with the villains. They are generic and uninteresting. This brings me back to my next point, the acting. Hugh Jackman is good as always. In this particular film he really gets to bring the animal out in his character. Rila Fukushima as Yariko didn't do it for me at first. She felt really bland. But as the movie went on I started to like her more and more. The rest of the cast is stale. With the exception of the train scene, the action was just there. It didn't do anything for me. I didn't care about anything going on with the plot. It just wasn't interesting. So in the end. The Wolverine suffers from mostly bad acting, generic villains, almost non existent character development, dull plot, and bad story.",

      "text": "I always feel that movies set in Japan are automatically at an advantage because of the inherent beauty and tradition that comes with the country which is why The Wolverine is such a colossal disappointment. When Logan (Hugh Jackman) saves a Japanese man's life in Hiroshima in 1945 he sets off  chain reaction that brings about death and destruction in the present when Wolverine is summoned by the man so that he can say his goodbyes. While Jackman is a talented performer, The Wolverine is beyond saving as it is derivative, predictable and most of all, its boring. Working off a horrendous script by writers Mark Bomback and Scott Frank, director James Mangold shows a talent behind the camera for the action in the film with a high speed chase on a bullet train being a breathtaking piece of cinema but he fails to display emotion or evoke character out of his wooden performers. It's not entirely his fault, the acting is dire with both female leads dragging the film down. The constant references to X-Men: The Last Stand and the presence of Famke Janssen's Jean Grey reminds viewers of the nonsensical mess of a film that was, which should make The Wolverine look stellar by comparison but it only really makes you long for the days of Bryan Singers X films. While the film does try to fix the character of Logan, ridding him of some of his grief and shame, it just feels like a stop gap before Jackman is set to appear in the following X film, Days of Future Past. Ultimately its a feature that doesn't live up to its potential and makes light of its own story of redemption by having Logan murder countless numbers of people as if for sport making the whole movie a waste of anyone's precious time.",

I don\u2019t know why they call the movie \u201cWOLVERINE\u201d cuz Hugh Jackman has nothing to do with any of the plot of characters until the last 10 minutes of the movie if you exclude the brief yet passionless encounter between Jackman and a young woman. But the Wolverine does make an interesting ally for the movie\u2019s warring gang factions. I suppose the producer also needed a \u2018superstar\u2019 to pander his Kung Fu movie since Hugh Jackman is the only white guy along with some toxic blond who struts around in Jimmy Chu\u2019s and spends most of the movie deep throating her venomous forked tongue into unsuspecting male admirers. Again, why this character is in the movie, makes no sense other than erotic and to push the envelope of the R rating. This having been said, the movie was only okay because the \u2018flow\u2019 (I use the term loosely) is constantly interrupted by the need for another martial arts battle. It got boring for me after like the 10th battle and each battle goes on for a while.The giant metal samurai battle at the end was laughable, sorry. Its probably me and I don\u2019t mean to sound jaded (no pun intended) but after having seen Crouching Tiger nothing really impresses me in this arena. If you\u2019re going to do a 2 hr. martial arts movie you had better have awesome dialogue and impressive plot/characters.With the exception of Wolverine this had neither. So going full circle, this is why the movie is called WOLVERINE. But don\u2019t be disheartened X-Men fans. There was an interesting \u2018teaser\u2019 at the end with Magneto and Xavier which shows promise for the NEXT X-Men  Wolverine release. On the upside PIXAR and DISNEY have a slew of new releases coming out in genuine ADHD guaranteed to keep the little tikes bouncing off the wall way past their bedtime.",

I was a big fan of Wolverine growing up, but in the movies he's something less. He's supposed to be very old, and one of the best melee fighters, but he is constantly getting his butt kicked by practically every other melee fighter that he comes up against. He's been around a long time, you would think he has learned a few languages by this time, and become a bit more cultured, at least in knowing about the ways of other people. He still looks/acts like a barbarian in many ways, which I understand to be part of his character, but he's also potentially hundreds of years old and has had to have had a lot of different experiences and exposure to worldly ways. He was obviously in Japan many years ago, you would think he picked up a few tricks. I understand that he's supposed to be a wild badass, but why not give him some culture mixed in. It would have been awesome if he surprised them all and actually knew how to speak Japanese and more about their culture to give him some more depth, and ass a bit of mystery, to show he is not just a one dimensional thug. He's also very stealthy and ninja like in the comics, but in the movies he runs in without looking or thinking, no stealth at all. Among other plot holes and questionable scenes, I didn't get the backstory about the Viper and why she served Yashida? Overall a bit slow, and boring at times, but there was some good acting by Hugh Jackman, and some of the fight scenes were fun, but the story and script was flat.",

The dialogue was boring, and the Japanese accents eventually made Hugh Jackman look completely out of place.  The action parts were good, but it's nothing you haven't already seen.

If you cant see that then watch it again as a stand alone film not as a film attached to the X Men franchise. Its a look into Logan and why he is who he is.",

As you can't treat a film that is 5th in a series, when it intentionally relates back to events in other movies, as stand alone, other movies must be mentioned. Briefly X-men 1,2,3 suffer the plight of a lot of comic book films. They feel satisfied to show you the characters without really many of the actors really owning them or doing anything unique with them. Halle Berry for instance can act. When she played storm though she went completely one dimensional. Comic books are things which have been adapted and re-interpreted for decades. And the transition to film has worked a lot better for some comics than others. X1 to X3 were treated as ensemble films with some actors getting bigger pieces than others, when they should have been treated more like overlapping story-line's with common characters.

Even when Aronofsky left the project, (handing of it off to James Mangold, the man behind such classics as Knight & Day, 3:10 to Yuma and Girl Interrupted), I still held out hope that some of Aronofsky\u2019s original vision could carry over to this new version of the story, but it seems I was wrong.

      "text": "2009's X-men Origins: Wolverine was received negatively by both critics and the majority of the fans of the character. Now the character has a chance to redeem himself with this year's the Wolverine and for the most part he does. This film has really tried to please the fans as it was loosely based on the beloved Japan story line from the comics and it is clear that the film has tried to fix the problems that were complained about in the previous solo Wolverine film. Despite taking place after the events of X-men: The Last Stand this film attempts to distance itself from the rest of the X-men characters and story and focuses solely on the Wolverine character and as a result this film feels very different to all previous X-men films. This allows for the best portrayal of Wolverine's character that we have seen so far and Hugh Jackman also delivers his best performance of the character to date. I really enjoyed the pacing of the film as well because although it was a face paced action film it wasn't afraid to slow things down and develop the characters and the relationships between them. However it never slows down for too long before it picks up the pace with another action scene. The action in this film is also very well done because every sequence is creative and has a purpose so it never feels like the mindless action we've come to expect in big budget summer films. Humour is also used effectively in this film as the writers take advantage of Wolverine's IDGAF attitude. However the film isn't perfect as there is one other mutant character that occasionally seems slightly out of place and some people might find her character a bit too over the top. Also from time to time it does feel like they are playing it too safe to insure that they don't make any of the same mistakes as the last Wolverine film. Overall The Wolverine, although not perfect, is a fun superhero film that gets a lot of things right about what makes the Wolverine character so popular.",

It does its best of keeping characters intact while deviating from the comics in the sake of a self contained story and grander character development.  As a Wolverine fan it was nice to see a meaningful relationship blossom between Wolverine and Mariko, unlike the comics where it really is love at first sight.  Instead here Wolverine falls in love not entirely with the character, but rather with the idea of being a protector, a take that is a welcome addition to the Claremont storyline.  As for Silver Samurai and Viper, let us not forget they were involved in the X Men issues directly connecting to the Wolverine miniseries, their characters have undertaken slight adjustments in order to incorporate ideas from the Fatal Attractions storyline. I loved that some of the plot took from Wolverine's side of this storyline because it was one of the few times in the series where Logan did feel vulnerable.  All in all I think its the best character study of Wolverine any fan could ask for.  Wolverine struggles with his animalistic urges and his commitment to reform, he grapples to find meaning in his endless immortality, and he ultimately finds purpose, a purpose that is fulfilled in his return as an X-Man.  None of these developments are significantly or profoundly discovered, rather they are slowly revealed, which may turn casual movie goers off from enjoying this film.  As a thoughtful exploration of Wolverine's character and a grand homage to incredible source material though, how can any Wolverine fan say no to this movie? It is the best X-Men movie and one of the best comic based movies.",

It had a good amount of action, a decent plot and Hugh Jackmans witty humor again, I guess you can't ask for much more from a film like this. It was a fun movie to watch for sure, just don't expect a perfect film but you'd honestly be a fool to expect that. 5.5/10",

This film gets so much right, but its biggest achievement is something that no super hero film has done before, whether it be Marvel or DC, is that it manages to stay true to the comics, while also entertaining causal film fans. Hell this film could entertain anybody, whether there action  fans, drama fans any fan! It's a definitley risky for Marvel to try something like this, and they have pulled it of amazingly, but the real glue that holds this together is Jackman's preformance. Now we all know its always been good, but this time he takes it to a whole new level. He's dark, thematic, serious and engaging, with such good character development. It's a shame that some of the other character aren't as well developed. Despite this they are incredibly well acted. On par with the acting is the directing, which never feels out of place. Another spectacular feat it manages to accomplish is that it balances the substance and the action, nether letting one out way the other. But the one thing that ultimately kills this film for me is its extremely awful ending. Any fan will agree! It's anti-climactic, lazy, go's away from the comics and has some of the worst CGI I have ever seen! If only that ending wasn't here, I reckon think this film could of easily got a nine, maybe even a ten, but I can't forgive that ending.",

This was mostly a character driven film with very little plot. It starts off strong with a very emotional and intense scene, but from there the film starts to lose path. The viper chick was a useless character that felt forced into the script in order to have more than two mutants. The Wolverine lacked a villain with strong presence, a plot, and an impactful score especially for a superhero movie. Hugh Jackman is at his best, and at this point it feels as if nobody else can play the legendary comic book character but him. The fight scenes had very good choreography, but the shaky camera made it hard to focus in what was going on. I especially like the train fight scene, even if it did make the eyebrows of every physicist rise. I appreciate this movie because they are at least on the right path to making wolverine movies, which origins failed to accomplish, but I cannot excuse The Wolverine of its empty plot driven solely on the development of one character surrounded by many seemingly empty characters.",

      "text": "Despite a clunky third act, 'The Wolverine' is a fantastic comic-book movie, and contains one of the best performances from Hugh Jackman, playing the title character, that we've seen for years. The movie begins in 1945 at a POW camp in Nagasaki, Japan, as an atomic bomb goes off, Logan (Jackman) rescues officer Ichiro Yashida (Ken Yamamura). We cut to years later, at the present time, where we see our hero having dreams and often hallucinates about Jean (Famke Janssen), feeling the everlong guilt when he killed her in the events of 'X-Men: The Last Stand' (2006) when she became the Phoenix. He wakes up again, and it seems that he living rough, sleeping in the woods with very little left of his life. He is then approached by Yukio (Rila Fukushima), who tells him that Master Yashida (Haruhiko Yamanouchi), the man he saved all those years ago, owes him an overdue thanks. Logan seems reluctant at first to go to Japan just to say goodbye to an old man he once knew, but goes along anyway since he doesn't have any other choice. When he arrives in Tokyo, he meets Yashida's granddaughter, Mariko (Tao Okamoto), and is told that he must protect her, as her father, Shingen Yashida (Hiroyuki Sanada) is planning against her. The movie then becomes a mission where Wolverine is essentially Mariko's bodyguard throughout the whole process. Logan keeps getting these visions of Jean and it makes it difficult for him, emotionally, and when he finally meets the older Yashida, he promises Logan that he can make him mortal, and live long and die a normal death. Logan begins to feel strange over the next few days as his healing abilities seem unable to work, not only is he emotionally unstable, mourning the death of Jean, but he is physically unable to fight, as it seems that Yashida's plan to make Logan mortal is working. 'The Wolverine', directed by James Mangold (who also directed 'Walk the Line'), is a darker, grittier, and more realistic entry into the \"X-Men\" franchise. It's more grounded and less of a spectacle. The action scenes are crafted brilliantly, the acting is superb and committed, and just the overall movie, is brilliant to watch, especially in the comic-book genre. The third act is the movie's weak spot as it does bog down towards CGI nonsense, but overall, this is a brilliant, polished movie, and is certainly a huge improvement over 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine' (2009).",

I think what saves and makes it worth watching is the mid-credits scene featuring the return of some very famous characters. Overall, It's better than Origins but no that big of a step up.",

The pacing and the way this movie looks is stunning,my favorite part of this movie is when Wolverine is crouched outside a motel in Japan (this whole movie mostly takes place in Japan) pouring with rain.

      "text": "\"The Wolverine\" is the second attempt to give the titular her his own film. It is better than \"Origins\" in a technical level but unlike its infamous predecessor, it is unmemorable with a few moments not withstanding. One thing that did stand out was the Computer Effects of a Grizzly bear in the first few minutes which is some of the most laughable CG I had seen in a long time. Throughout the rest of the film, the CGI is passable but the bear is so unconvincing that it feels that I am watching \" The Langoliers\". The pot had some potential of Wolverine suffering from guilt from having to kill Jean in the events of the third movie and wanted to get rid of his immortality. The grief had potental to explore Wolverine's chracter of an immortal trapped in a life full of violence but the flashbacks act as anusance at best and the thirst for mortality is diminished when he gets poisoned. The Silver Samurai is a downgrade from his comic counterpart as he is portray in the original source material as a warrior looking for a challenge but has his own code of honor like a real samurai. The film version though is really a manipulator who fights dirty and rely on technology to get his power like an Iron-Man villain. The love interest could have been interesting but being Wolverine's Sidekick appears to be her only role. The action doesn't really stand out with the exception of the fight on top of the bullet train. This was the one time when Wolverine felt vulnerable because he struggles to keep his balance n a train that is faster then the speed of sound and Wolverine desperately tries not to fall to his death. With the exception of that one scene, the film really has no bearing on the overall series. Any consequence is rendered meaningless as they are ignored after the events of \"Days of Future Past\". If one truly has the desire to see this film it is a harmless waste of time; you wouldn't gain anything from  watching it but you wouldn't loose anything either.",
