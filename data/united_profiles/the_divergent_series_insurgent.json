But it was also neat to see the world fleshed out, and to see the homes and peoples of the other factions and the breadth of life within their walled city.  The dystopian backdrop of urban decay was well used in this movie, as they're always moving in and around ruins.  The plot seemed more developed and focused in this movie, although there were several frustrating moments when it seemed like everyone was just making the worst decisions possible in the moment.  Overall, I thought it was a neat movie, and definitely more interesting than the first; I expect I'll see the final installment in theatres, although I can't imagine I'd line up opening weekend for the chance.",

Everyone's been comparing this series to \"The Hunger Games\" and it's not worth it. While a bit toned down, this franchise got its' own backbone. Before I get to the flaws, let me tell why do I like this one better than its' predecessor. The stakes are higher and the pace faster, which adds the effect if in IMAX 3D. The actors are fine as well as the first one. Now, the flaws. Some scenes are a bit clunky. It's because of the script, which is the strength and the weakness of this movie. You'll see it when you do. But that doesn't stop me from liking it because it is plot-wise. Of course, that's just my opinion.

Kate Winslet has lost all her charm, Four is less badass, and Miles Teller is in this again for some reason. Director Robert Schwnetke improves over his horrible, R.I.P.D and directs better, with slick camera shots are more emotion as an extra.

The point of this movie is to discover why the events of the first movie have transpired and, when the movie ends, leaves you wondering how things are going to unfold in the third and fourth movies (if you haven't read the books).  Most of the good of the first movie still plays here, but I couldn't help but feel like Insurgent sold itself short.  The big reveal toward the end is intriguing, but the problem I had was I wasn't as invested in the story by the time I got there.  If the Divergent Series is going to avoid disaster, the folks in charge of making this movie need to push the cast and writers harder.  There are too many inconsistencies in the acting performances to sell the emotional turmoil that is supposed to be eating up Tris and select other cast members.  Basically, there is no anchor as Tris is no Jennifer Lawrence and thus the film doesn't force audiences to be immersed into this fictional world.  I'll still watch the rest of the series, but it will be a tragedy if the next pair of films can't learn from the mistakes of this particular chapter.",

In what was once Chicago, the war between the factions has begun, and this time, no faction is safe from the Erudite. The intellectual faction has started collecting all the Divergent, in an attempt to open a mysterious box, that supposedly contains something that will change all their lives forever. Tris and Four are on the other-side, doing everything they can to stop the group from hunting the Divergents, whom they see as the key to changing everything. The first part of this film is an excellent representation of the novel and is every bit as exhilarating, but the second part veers off into a new direction. The films producers said they wanted to make the story easier for the casual fan to understand, and they did that, unfortunately, taking away the complexity of the story, takes away some of it's magic. As for the ending, it is completely different from the novel, leaving many to wonder if they'll make the third book into a film at all. Indeed they plan to, but it's hard to see just how they will go about doing it, after the events put in place by the end of this film. Shailene Woodley and Theo James returned for the sequel and again, they played the characters to tee, I really felt like these two were meant to play Tris and Four before the book was even set to be released on the big screen. Once again, the special effects, the acting, and the story are amazing, and this film would be worthy of five stars, if not for the ending that diverted too far away from the original story.",

The book(s) were so much better (usually they are), they had great plot lines you could follow, far more emotional stuff that was part of the whole, way too many changes completely from the books.  I've seen good books turn into not great movies, but this is barely recognizable to the book. People change, their actions change, they leave out 80% of the book and replace another 30% with something completely different.

The problem in the main is that the earlier movie was more interesting as it was setting up the scenario. This one just becomes a kind of futuristic chase movie that is far too long. Plot points often lack clarity and whilst the film is eminently watchable the middle section drags noticeably. Shailene Woodley is a major asset as well as being a great little actress into the bargain. She out acts everyone else on screen even if Kate Winslet and Miles Teller have their moments. To get the most from proceedings it is advisable to have seen the earlier film if just for context. Naomi Watts is introduced here as a potential baddie but she doesn't really come into her own here. However, if the rather good ending is anything to go by, we can look forward to seeing a lot more of her next time when hopefully this film's failings are sorted out and improved upon. Finally, the special effects aren't bad, but there isn't really anything here that hasn't been seen before.",

The characters are underdeveloped, the chemistry stinks, and the finished film looks and feels teen-ish and unprofessional. There are some strokes of greatness in there though like some of the acting and some of the science fiction ideas of the movie.",
