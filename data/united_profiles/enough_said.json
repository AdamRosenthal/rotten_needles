Television stars who transition to the big screen typically have difficulty shedding the image their small screen roles have imposed upon them and the longer the series runs, the more of a problem it becomes. Jason Alexander will always be \u201cGeorge\u201d in spite of his many efforts to leave that image behind. So, it is an awesome experience to watch Mr..Gandolfini, and Ms. Louis-Dreyfus successfully depart from their \u201cTony Soprano\u201d and \u201cElaine\u201d personas and portray totally different characters. Much of this success belongs to Ms. Nicole Hofofcener who wrote and directed this delightful film. There is the expected humor but, more than that, the film delves deeply into the mid-life crises each of the characters faces and the sensitivity of the writing is equal to the humor it evokes; a delicate balance indeed. The viewing experience is, of course, bitter sweet as one remembers the sad fact that Mr. Gandolfini is no longer with us and that this versatile and gifted actor left us much too soon with a body of work yet to be completed. I give this film an 8 and recommend it to all who enjoy a quality film.",

The screenplay brings out the bitter and the sweet and is recognisably true in capturing those small and  awkward moments moments that really do happen in real life. Supporting characters add to the fun and the whole thing is a delight.",

A subplot about Eva\u2019s best friend\u2019s inability to fire her housekeeper gestures, a bit too obliquely, at social satire (Holofcener\u2019s last two films, Friends With Money and Please Give, dealt more explicitly with matters of class and social mobility). But I appreciate that this movie doesn\u2019t make us choose between context-based character humor and snappy romantic banter\u2014instead, it provides both in great bounty. Elaine Benes and Tony Soprano may seem an unlikely pairing, but Louis-Dreyfus and Gandolfini make strangely persuasive bedfellows\u2014in fact, they\u2019re one of the most impossible-not-to-root-for on-screen couples in recent memory. Gandolfini, by all accounts, was a gentle, modest, and sensitive man who felt emotionally depleted by the violent, dark roles he was generally called on to play in the wake of The Sopranos. Here, we get a glimpse of the second career he could have had as a light comedic heartthrob. That it won\u2019t ever come to be is only one of countless reasons to wish Gandolfini were still around.",

Though Holofcener\u2019s career is much younger than Allen\u2019s (and not nearly as prolific) her work feels right at home next to the typical Allen film. Instead of intricate plots, both directors prefer more open-ended explorations of the privileged middle and upper classes, and the various hijinks in which they dabble. And even though Enough Said\u2019s style and structure occasionally feel like that of a network sitcom, it is ultimately a highly enjoyable comedy, albeit one that operates at a broader level than Holofcener\u2019s previous work.",
