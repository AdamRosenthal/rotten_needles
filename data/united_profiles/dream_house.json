The script is well written in the early suspense  parts of the film, from the middle to the end, especially in the last one is weird, and rushed - the movie would have the potential to be a good movie, if he hadn't \"lost his breath\" and finished so abruptly, out of nowhere (and a brief scene with any connection to the main story appear at the beginning of it, to explain the end).

It becomes very hard to distinguish what is real and what is in his head. If the story hadn't been so arrogant and smug, thinking it was smarter than it was, the plot twist could've been unexpected and thrilling. Instead, the movie implodes into itself.",

If you lost interest of watching it, well you should still give it a try, because there's actually even more twists. If I haven't seen the trailer, the story would have been more surprising and likable. So '' Dream House '' is pretty much what you think it is, but not really. It's similar to '' Shutter Island ''. If you have seen many psychological thrillers, then this movie will be predictable for you. There's nothing new about it, so it's not very original. Has a psychological movie fan, i'm a little bit disappointed. There was moments that were mysterious and intriguing.The part that captivated me the most was the end twist. The rest was quite boring and forgettable.The movie does have good points to. The ambiance was creepy (the music, the house, the trees, etc) and the acting was good. '' Dream House '' could have been better, it felt '' incomplete ''. It's an average movie. It's not worth seeing in theaters. You should rent it when it comes out on blu-ray and DVD.",

Although I was impressed by the trailer I was not too inclined to see it , but overall I am glad I did, since it has many worthwhile moments. It is difficult to say too much about the film without spoilers which I will try to avoid.  It is an entertaining if slow film which starts well, blindsides you quite early on and then ends predictably.  The main performances are excellent, and it is also well shot with some nice scenes.  This makes for an engaging and intriguing film in many ways but it is just unfortunate that the story is not strong enough and the whole ends up less than the sum of its parts. A good (if not necessarily original) idea which maybe required a bit more work to make a really good film.",

Unfortunately viewers got more than a taste of what the movie would be before they stepped foot in the theater because of the spoiler trailer. Instead of the excitement I had in movies like Shutter Island or Identity, I was stuck wondering how this would get resolved or why I would care. Fortunately Craig did a great job and his real life and on screen wife had a great rapport with him that really kept me interested. Sadly it wasn't enough to make up for the terrible \"twist\" you didn't know about beforehand and the dreadful parts of Naomi Watts and the two villains. Definitely a pass.",

      "text": "Dream House is a hard movie to review  or even describe  without revealing too many twists and turns of the plot. The film stars Daniel Craig (Girl With The Dragon Tattoo) as a writer who settles into a quaint home with his wife (Rachel Weisz) and two daughters, only to learn that their house was the scene of a horrific crime. When strange things start going bump in the night, the husband starts to uncover a connection to the tragic murders  but only the pretty neighbor (Naomi Watts) seems to know what\u2019s going on for sure. Dream House was directed by Jim Sheridan, the man behind such great films as My Left Foot and The Boxer, as well as so-so films like Brothers and Get Rich or Die Trying. Sheridan is a skilled director (even when he\u2019s working with half-baked material) so technically speaking, Dream House is visually sound and richly textured in its disparity between the warm hues and glows of a family home, full of love, and the harsh, blue-tinted, snow-ridden world outside that home  or, at times, the grit and grime of homes that have been overrun with rot and despair. The other strength of the film is its cast. Craig, Weisz and Watts are all skilled actors and keep a lot of the more ridiculous aspects of the story (more on that later) grounded in believable performances. Craig  often stone-faced and grim  displays some warmth and smiles in his role as a loving father, though he gets ample time to stone-face it as well. Weisz is good as a free-spirited wife and mother; she makes her character stand out as a unique and fully-formed person, while Watts is given a harder task, playing a pivotal character that has to be balanced just right to be believable at all. Watts almost pulls of that balancing act, but not quite. Guys like Elias Koteas and Marton Csokas are great character actors  though they\u2019re given little to work with here. This is also a film that changes gears very drastically in its 1st, 2nd, and 3rd acts, and subsequently feels disjointed and episodic, rather than organic and cohesive. There are also a truckload of logical flaws, and plot holes so wide they are nearly impossible not to fall into. On the whole, the poor script reduces Dream House to a movie that is hard to get into  and stay into  despite the talented actors and director working to keep it grounded and engaging. Sometimes an idea just falls flat. There\u2019s no harm in the trying. Certain viewers may watch Dream House and be thrilled by the shifting, uncertain nature of its plot (if they can avoid scrutinizing it and simply brush off the gaping holes). As stated, the film is well-constructed and well-acted, so it\u2019s not a total nightmare. However, like the strangest of dreams, watching this movie will  leave you feeling muddled and somewhat upset about the experience.",
