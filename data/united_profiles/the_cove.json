I am however, pliable to a well-done documentary that may or may not change my position on a controversial subject. The Cove is a 2009 documentary film directed by Louie Psihoyos, that documents the annual slaughter of dolphins in Wakayama Japan. A fraction of the movie plays like a common documentary film, interviewing prominent figures in the fishing business and presenting the audience facts and related correlations. While the remainder of the film is in the point of view of a crew trying to attain documentation of dolphin cruelty.  Overall, the film succeeds in projecting its point, these water-dwelling mammals are under unbelievably considerable cruelty.  The film is remarkably crafted and entirely deserves the Oscar that it received a few months back.  Although it is effective, I believe that it had a lack of what could have made it even more effectual. The part that really triggered my pathos was the actual footage of the dolphin slaughter and the risks the crew took in capturing the film.  The majority of the film focused on the facts, while the actual live filming, was in all actuality saved until the end.  If more of the film focused on the latter portion, it would have been ideal.  To conclude, The Cove is an effective documentary that is  astonishingly done in a good matter, but I have a feeling that it could have been faintly better.",
