      "text": "Alexandre Aja's Piranha 3D was hardly a masterpiece, but it was a real movie. It was well shot, featured some pretty great makeup effects and sported a decent amount of tension, balanced with zany comedy. The film took the characters seriously, even though the horror spewing mayhem of the killer fish all around them was laugh-inducing. That was part of the film's charm. John Gulager's follow-up, on the other hand, has no charm, or class for that matter. Piranha 3DD is an awful film because it doesn't understand what made the first film work for most audiences. Instead, it swaps sly political and social subtext for stale, shameful cameos, derp jokes and juvenile gags fit for a crass Meet the Spartans-type spoof. Picking up a little while after the events of the first film, Piranha 3DD brings the killer fish to a wild water park run by a sleazy entrepreneur (David Koechner). And that's pretty much the whole plot of the film, which barely runs over an hour (sans credits). The water park is overrun with the monster fish, and the final twist of the first film (that there are mega piranhas) is pretty much left untapped. The characters are meaningless, and there's not a likeable soul inhabiting a single corner of picture. The film is gory, sure, but even the violence and mayhem isn't nearly as shocking, or amusing. It's just bloody and uninventive. The nudity also feels dialed back, which is bizarre given the film takes place at a water park patrolled by stripper lifeguards. There's breasts and bums all over the place, but Aja's film pulled a few full frontal scenes, including a hilariously tantalizing underwater ballet. There's nothing here that tops that, nor does the film ever even seem to want to try. And that's the problem with Piranha 3DD  it's not trying, at all. It's just a shallow, muddy killer fish film with paper-thin characters, an insultingly boring narrative and lifeless thrills. The cameos are remarkably embarrassing, especially a seemingly drunken David Hasselhoff (who's seen better days). The returning actors from the previous film (Ving Rhames, Christopher Lloyd and Paul Scheer  who died off-screen, mind you) stick out like a sore thumb, too. They don't work in the world Gulager has created, because his world isn't logical, and it's populated by moronic stereotypes and unrealistic non-human humans. Piranha 3DD is a terrible film, and that's a tragedy. There was room for a good sequel to Alexandre Aja's original, but John Gulager and crew messed it all up. What remains is pretty solid Blu-ray for a film that's barely even worth renting.",

Piranha 3DD, on the other hand, wasn't made to be relaxing in the sun filled with deadly eating piranhas. I was trying to find it at the Edwards theater in Fairfield, CA, instead it's in limited releases. How stupid is that? I know what DD usually stands for... gigantic **** I love big women with big boobs. I thought it was supposed to be delayed until July or August, but June 1? Please. Even Baywatch has its own movie in 3-D. So I'd better watch Piranha on Itunes instead of watching this horrible messed up sequel with no returning cast (just good ol' Christopher Lloyd and Ving Rhames) and a slew of unfunny moments. Piranha 3DD looks to be a fish-out-of-water bomb and so I'll be waiting for the results of this week's box office to see it will be a flop for the summer. Until then, Piranha 3DD is one of the worst movies of 2012. Save your $20 bucks and wait for The Cabin in the Woods on Blu-Ray.",

I tried to overlook the ridiculous sex scene that was probably the film's bloodiest moment. But when the massive carnage finally comes it is so limp and most of the \"Oh My God\" moments are reduced to hindsight reflections. Most of the kills occur so fast. The massive set piece (the water park) is stacked with possible gross out occurrences that never happen. Instead, we get a guy who is having his way with a pool drain. The cast is mostly wasted. What makes this even more of a let down is it has the same feisty-trashy stamp of awfulness that the two Feast sequels had. Yes, there is nothing wrong with mean-spirited but mean-spirited and humor don't really mesh well for me (personal taste).",

      "text": "The first film, \"Piranha,\" was adored by many as a guilty pleasure or a shot in the arm of cheese.  Now we are given, \"Piranha 3DD,\" which has the same pre-historic flesh eating army of piranhas moving from a vacation lake locale to a chlorine filled water-park.  Much is much the same, but just more gory, more nudity, and more senselessness.  This sequel has a new director in John Gulager (\"Feast\"), but it does not offer anything fresh.  Just more gross out deaths that come across as more head-shaking than elaborate of shocking.  The only returning cast members are Christopher Lloyd as Carl, whom is the nutty scientist character that learns more about the ancient piranhas, and Ving Rhames as Sheriff Fallon, whom we all thought died in the first, but only lost his legs to the piranhas and is now able to attach a shotgun as leg instead.  New to the cast is the young Danielle Panabaker (\"Sky High\" and \"Friday the 13th\") as the lead and David Koechner (\"Anchorman\") as her dim-witted stepfather and owner of the water park where the majority of the killing takes place.  If you are a fan of the original, you may enjoy this one, but it is just same gore fest over again shot entirely in 3D and of course with continuous nudity of young women.  The only mere bright spot is a the cameo of David Hasselhoff as himself.  He actually has a few really funny scenes poking fun at himself and his career, but it comes nowhere close to saving the film.  Gary Busey also makes a early cameo in the film, but its a mellow return to film for him, it might have worked better for him if he actually poked fun of himself like Hasselhoff rather than playing a character.  Bottom line:  Only notable thing about the film is a cameo by Hasselhoff, the rest is a forgettable, gore dunce fest that overstays its welcome.",

Those pesky pre-historic piranhas have found their way into a new lake, but unfortunately for the locals, the lake also serves as the source for the the new Big Wet water park! If you thought PIRANHA 3D was in poor taste, you ain't seen nuthin' yet! The creative team behind the cult-classic FEAST takes over in this direct-to-video sequel, and they have really nailed it this time. PIRANHA 3DD shoots way over the top with its crude humor and exploitative fun, throwing political-correctness to the wind along with plenty of limbs and bikini tops. Don't let the 'R' rating fool you... This film has more gratuitous nudity and violence than any Uncut DVD on the market. All contextualized, of course. Where PIRANHA 3D never struck an even balance between the humor and horror, director John Gulager and writers Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan keep the pace moving a mile a minute as they shock, entertain, and completely disgust along the way. If that weren't enough, PIRANHA 3DD unleashes the one-and-only David Hasselhoff in a brilliant self-parody for the final act. Any fans who may have been disappointed with the last PIRANHA can get ready for a stupid good time with PIRANHA 3DD!",

      "text": "What did I just watch? The answer: 87 minutes of nudity, unneeded snap zooms, overly color corrected blue water, and absolutely zero plot or character development. I always try to find good in a film, but there are very few aspects of Piranha 3DD that made me enjoy it. The idea this film is based around is far-fetched to start with, but the creative team took it to an unfortunate extreme. Who was the protagonist? Who was the antagonist? What is stasis A and what is stasis B? Why do I care about any of the character's fates in this slaughterfest? If the director or any of the actors could answer these questions I would be impressed. It's a pandemonium of scenes spliced together and put on screen. This movie was made for the money not ratings, which is a shame. What is the Sci-fi/Horror genre becoming?",
