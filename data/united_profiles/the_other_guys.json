Then the reviews started sneaking out, and they were trending surprisingly positive. Not just \"this is okay for a summer yukfest\" positive but \"this is one of Will Ferrell's best movies ever!\" positive. On opening night, it was certified fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, with a score in the low 80s. Second only to Elf (2003). That's a better score than Talladega Nights (2006), Stranger than Fiction (2006), Wedding Crashers (2005), Anchorman (2004) and Old School (2003). Take a look at that list again. \"Wow,\" you might be thinking, as I did the other night. \"I must have got it all wrong. This movie must be pretty awesome!\" Nope. Nope it isn't. I mean yeah, it's alright. But I'd say it's worse than every one of the Ferrell flicks listed above, save Talladega Nights, which is equally hit or miss.

      "text": "The Other Guys tells the story of Officers Terry Hoitz (Mark Whalberg) and Allen Gamble (Will Ferrell) who aren't the hero cops that the police department idolize, they're merely the Other Guys. The main guys, Danson (The Rock/Dwayne Johnson) and Highsmith (SAMUEL L JACKSON!) set the film alight with their testosterone fuelled opening sequence of brilliance, complete with brilliant lines such as \"Did somebody call 91-Holy **** and \"You have the right to remain silent, but I wanna hear you scream!\". Using a bus to slingshot a car into druggie bad guys and into a store, causing an explosion, now THATS an opening sequence. Martin and Fosse are the rivals of Hoitz and Gamble, leading to a silent fight at a wake with characters whispering insults and momentarily stopping to pay condolences. They also get some killer dialogue, whether its cornering a villian (\"I hope you like the taste of prison food...and penis\") or talking about their weekend. \"So then what happened?\" \"What do you think happened? I woke up, I took the belt off my neck, got in my car, and got out of there.\" \"Talk about a wild weekend\" \"I thought I was going to have to shoot my way out, hahahaha ...what are you going to do though, you know ...bar mitzvah's\" They have an especially funny scene in a classroom of 10 year olds, which is probably my favourite scene in the film, and their retorts about the coke-covered car were especially funny. Of course, the two main characters get their share of funny dialogue also, whether its Will Ferrells quote about how a tuna would beat a lion in a fight or groaning about how walking away from explosions are BS. Its not just the quotes which are funny about them, as Gamble is revealed to have shot Derek Jeter in a flashback (\"He's a bi-racial angel\") and Terry gets his gun taken away and given a wooden gun, only to have the wooden gun taken and given a rape whistle. All of the actors play their roles well, (after Planet of the Apes and The Happening, you'll be surprised Mark Whalberg plays a role well) and Steve Coogan definatley does well as the troubled business man. Even the one scene characters like Christinith and her hairy (or not) husband do well when they are showed, even if they provide nothing to the plot but comedic foil. As you can see, I loved a lot about this film. But not everything worked. Bits that didn't work for me? The relationship between Terry and his wife (Eva Mendez) wasn't really funny, it was essentially him saying his hot wife was plain and treated her unspectacularly. Granted, I liked their last scene where he made amends with her and admitted he couldn't believe she was with him, and sending the granny out to relay their dirty messages had me laughing, but the bits before didn't make me laugh. Making Terry a pimp back in college seems to be an idea which is great when you say it out loud, but when executed you seem a little dissapointed. Also, Will Ferrell didn't even convince as a college guy, he just looked like a 40 something man retaking college, but thats a minor niggle. Also, the scene where Allen is jealous over his wife taking ballet with another guy (I assume that was her instructor). Will Ferrell livened up that scene, and Allens good ballet dancing was a laughable surprise, but the rest of the scene just didn't work for me. All in all, this film isn't as good as Anchorman, but it certainly beats the dire Cop-Out. Definately a brilliant action comedy",

He will have more comedy roles due to this one, and I am looking forward to seeing them.  The story behind \"The Other Guys\" is kind of dark.  How big-time business men rob hard-working americans of their lifetime services just to cover losses.  Wahlberg and Farrell are the cops behind-the-scenes who protect us from them, and they are just hilarious while they do so.  The Captain's TLC references had me laughing for days and have become punch-lines to almost any joke you can think of.  Priceless movie and an instant classic. 10/10",

Next two showings of the movie were sold out so we (wife and 3 sons) skipped it but had high hopes given its popularity. Returned Sunday evening again at 7pm and the showing was half-full; important because great comedies are even better when a big audience is howling.

My expectations of Ferrell are set based on the antics in Talladega Nights, Anchorman, and Step Brothers, but at no point within this movie was Ferrell able to take over and put his hilarious signature on it.  Eva Longorio was the best part of this movie, while the \"hot girls love Ferrell's character\" joke was just not that funny after the Eva Longorio dinner scene.

Adam McKay's  \"The Other Guys\" is in some ways like \"Talladega Nights\" it follows two bungling New York City detectives   Detective Allen Gamble(Will Ferrell)  and his volatile partner Detective Terry Hoitz(a funnier than expected Mark Wahlberg) are two mismatched cops hot on the trail of a corporate conspiracy. That essentially is the plot of the entire film in a nutshell, through out most of the picture Gamble and Hoitz are running around aimlessly trying to piece together a conspiracy that to a normal person would seem paper-thin but too gamble and Hoitz it\u00e2",

      "text": "Just like Thelma and Louise, who drove their 1964 Ford Convertible into the Grand Canyon, Highsmith(Samuel L. Jackson) and Danson(Dwayne Johnson) commit suicide, when the former says, \"Aim for the bushes,\" just before they plunge to their deaths from a high building. It's an inside joke; they can't aim for the \"bushes\" anymore. It's Highsmith who says, \"All the sex we don't have with women but we have to,\" at a press conference celebrating their latest heroics. Highsmith's bragging, a self-homage to he and his partner's legendary cocksmanship with the ladies, also has a double meaning, which becomes self-evident after their shocking demise. The reckless abandon that both men had brought to their pursuing of the drug dealers at the film's outset, now looks less like bravery, and more like a death wish. Homoeroticism, after all, is an open secret when \"buddy movies\" are concerned, but normally, such bromance innuendos are relegated to the subtext, a laughing matter. But the machismo of Highsmith and Danson seems so excessive, so flamboyantly straight, their virility quickly turns into burlesque. Played for laughs, \"The Other Guys\", on one level, satirizes every action film in which the hero seems impervious to bodily harm, regardless of the circumstances. Highsmith and Danson, surely, will land on their feet, like cats with nine lives, no matter what they do.  On another level, \"The Other Guys\" has a subtextual level that rises(the very instant when both cops jump and have no place to land) and intertwines itself with the surface of the official narrative, in which the fall then transforms itself into a lovers' leap, so the tragedy of closeted ladies' men who live up to the \"Shaft\" myth stealthily exists alongside the parodic intent to lampoon the hyper-masculinity of heterosexual men with guns. On the other hand, the other guys, in particular, Allen(Will Ferrell), is straight, even though he pushes paper and carries around a wooden gun. When his partner Terry(Mark Wahlberg) doubts his heterosexuality, Allen pistol-whips him on the nose.",

When Wahlberg throws the mug out the window, I realized that somehow, that was meant to be the rib-splitting climax of the scene, and I just sat there staring, thinking \"Omigod\"!  To me, I hesitate to rent comedies, because they're either truly funny, or (more often than not) simply painful.  \"The Other Guys\" is a glaring example of the second category.

While Ferrell's performance is far from his best (though by no means bad), the screen is dominated by a captivating comedy performance by Michael Keaton in his best role since Jackie Brown. Wahlberg also impresses, and his role as an under-appreciated and short-tempered detective gives him plenty to sink his teeth into. However, quite what Steve Coogan and Ray Stevenson (with bad Australian accent) are doing in the film at all is beyond me. There are some good jokes and some nice pop-culture references, and as a whole the film is very entertaining, even if it goes on for a bit too long and the plot meanders towards the end.

Strongly written and a good blend between humor and plot, The Other Guys is actually a pretty interesting comment on the financial crises of the 2000s while being an appropriately funny police comedy. Considered a parody of buddy cop films, you can certainly see that element here as it frequently mocks those types of films, while also being a great comment on masculinity. As a whole, The Other Guys is a thoroughly hysterical film that entertains from beginning to end without stopping.",
