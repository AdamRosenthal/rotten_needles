He does a great job of capturing the stoned vibe, weirdness, and zaniness of the novel. There is a lot in the book that didn't make it into the movie, but it would have been next to impossible to jam all of the book's plot in there. I'm grateful that Mr. Anderson decided to adapt this novel because Mr. Pynchon's weirdness is definitely compatible with the director's style. The cinematography is wonderful. The pacing is just right for the source material: I felt hypnotized by the dialogue - I actually felt stoned after the movie was over. Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of Doc Sportello is a comedic tour de force. Josh Brolin does an outstanding job and Katherine Waterston does a fine job as the femme fatale. The movie was hilarious and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Seeing as how I'm a  huge Thomas Pynchon fan, it was thrilling to see this masterful director and these virtuoso actors transform the offbeat novel into a thrilling, enjoyable film.",

Perpetually in a drug induced haze, Detective Larry \"Doc\" Sportello, portrayed brilliantly by Joaquin Phoenix, stumbles around trying to solve a case he cannot quite wrap his head around. Hell, there may not even be a case. But, what is certain is that he has no idea what is going on and neither does the audience. Impossible to follow and impossible to wrap your head around, Inherent Vice is a film that gives you a bunch of different puzzle pieces from different puzzles and tells you to put them together. Yet, in spite of that, I loved it. Our confusion mirrors that of Doc and really makes the film and enjoyable watch. It also does not hurt that it has a stellar cast on top of Joaquin Phoenix, including Benecio del Toro, Josh Brolin, Reese Witherspoon, Katherine Waterston, Joanna Newsom, Michael K. Williams, and Martin Short. No one other than Phoenix has that much screen time, but what they are given, they knock out of the park. The direction and writing from Paul Thomas Anderson are stellar as always. The film also does a great job capturing the drug-induced era it is set in and is a beautiful snapshot of the less than nice areas of Los Angeles in the 1970's. If you are comfortable not knowing what the hell is going on, but are willing to still sit there and try to piece together this possibly unsolvable \"case\", Inherent Vice is the film for you. Though it may not make much sense, Inherent Vice is just a really enjoyable and really, really well made film that even if the \"plot\" does not do it for you, there should be enough here for you to appreciate.",

Joaquin Phoenix plays hippie dope-head private investigator Doc Sportello, who is trying to solve the disappearance his ex-girlfriend (Katherine Waterston) and her new lover (Eric Roberts), a wealthy real estate developer.  The dialogue, at times, is difficult to hear/understand.   The plot is even more difficult to follow.  All you can do is inhale the psychedelic haze the permeates the movie, let go of reality and let things unfold.  Unfortunately, there isn\u2019t quite enough substance to the story line to sustain the movie\u2019s almost 2\u00bd hour run time.  Joaquin Phoenix, as, always, gives a terrific performance.  The cast is deep (including Josh Brolin, Reese Witherspoon, Owen Wilson, Beneicio Del Toro, Maya Rudolph and Jena Malone).  Brolin is perfectly cast for his role, which is a send-up of the quintessential 1960\u2019s LA police detective.  Martin Short is particularly funny in a brief stint as the immoral and drug abusing dentist Rudy Blatnoyd.  I found aspects of the movie fascinating, but overall, it came up short.  I recommend this movie only if you are looking for something irreverent and off-beat.",

The title itself is difficult to understand (look at what the term actually means) and you'll understand a bit of what Thomas Pynchon is trying to say. Does the movie do the book justice? Hells ya. Would I watch this movie without reading the book? Hells no.",

      "text": "Much like any Paul Thomas Anderson film, this will grow on you. I've come to trust this director after having seen The Master and There Will Be Blood, (Punch-Drunk Love too). If he makes the film then I know there's something worth investigating here. I took my time with this film and watched it multiple times - letting it play even while I fall asleep sometimes. The comedy is rather strong and Brolin and Phoenix give stellar portrayals of their respective archetype. Brolin (brawny cop with a soft side, perhaps) gives off this hilarious anger that he lets loose occasionally, and Phoenix (peace and love private investigator) is very easy-going while peering at the information he gathers through a cloud of marijuana smoke. The one thing that will make his character tick though - Shasta Fay. This film, like anything PTA, must be watched more than once.",

Joaquin is nothing short of a genius, his facial expressions, physical reactions and acting are superb. The movie is mysteriously funny, off-kilter but Immensely relatable. I was drawn into a time and place brought about by superior acting, writing and directing. My hat is off to Anderson, despite some negative reviews, which by the way, are totally undeserving.",

It compliments his style in every way imaginable while he still manages to bring original vision and flair to the project. Try to follow me through the summary, if you can dig it.",
