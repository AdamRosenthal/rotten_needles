He does a great job of capturing the stoned vibe, weirdness, and zaniness of the novel. There is a lot in the book that didn't make it into the movie, but it would have been next to impossible to jam all of the book's plot in there. I'm grateful that Mr. Anderson decided to adapt this novel because Mr. Pynchon's weirdness is definitely compatible with the director's style. The cinematography is wonderful. The pacing is just right for the source material: I felt hypnotized by the dialogue - I actually felt stoned after the movie was over. Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of Doc Sportello is a comedic tour de force. Josh Brolin does an outstanding job and Katherine Waterston does a fine job as the femme fatale. The movie was hilarious and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Seeing as how I'm a  huge Thomas Pynchon fan, it was thrilling to see this masterful director and these virtuoso actors transform the offbeat novel into a thrilling, enjoyable film.",

Perpetually in a drug induced haze, Detective Larry \"Doc\" Sportello, portrayed brilliantly by Joaquin Phoenix, stumbles around trying to solve a case he cannot quite wrap his head around. Hell, there may not even be a case. But, what is certain is that he has no idea what is going on and neither does the audience. Impossible to follow and impossible to wrap your head around, Inherent Vice is a film that gives you a bunch of different puzzle pieces from different puzzles and tells you to put them together. Yet, in spite of that, I loved it. Our confusion mirrors that of Doc and really makes the film and enjoyable watch. It also does not hurt that it has a stellar cast on top of Joaquin Phoenix, including Benecio del Toro, Josh Brolin, Reese Witherspoon, Katherine Waterston, Joanna Newsom, Michael K. Williams, and Martin Short. No one other than Phoenix has that much screen time, but what they are given, they knock out of the park. The direction and writing from Paul Thomas Anderson are stellar as always. The film also does a great job capturing the drug-induced era it is set in and is a beautiful snapshot of the less than nice areas of Los Angeles in the 1970's. If you are comfortable not knowing what the hell is going on, but are willing to still sit there and try to piece together this possibly unsolvable \"case\", Inherent Vice is the film for you. Though it may not make much sense, Inherent Vice is just a really enjoyable and really, really well made film that even if the \"plot\" does not do it for you, there should be enough here for you to appreciate.",

I love this guy, 'hard eight', 'boogie nights' and 'magnolia' were great films.  'magnolia' is hard to watch but it's at the top of my favorites.   Everything about the movie is genius.  But this movie looks like a bunch of bored, rich actors run amuck.   The movie is insulting and I'm not sure if that wasn't really the point.  To make a great movie you have to get about a 100 things right all at once.   This movie is 0 for 100.  It's not just that it's not funny or entertaining.  It's nothing.   Or, maybe I just wasn't stoned enough ....not sure if there is enough weed in cali to make up for it though.",
