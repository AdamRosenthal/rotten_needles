On the upside - the film is colourful, the voice acting is fine, there are some nice jokes, albeit adult ones, and the film is certainly watchable. But on the down sides - most of the child-aimed jokes fall flat; the humour being too mature for children but a bit somewhat childish for adults, the script is a confused mess and the animation, though colourful, is dull and nothing very interesting. Also, apart for Mr. Peabody, I didn't like or care about any characters. Perhaps I am being a bit too harsh on the film - some people will surely be entertained by this film, but in my opinion Mr. Peabody & Sherman is a disappointing, albeit somewhat enjoyable, mess.",

      "text": "If you watched the Rocky & Bullwinkle show, you'll remember this duo. If not, Mr. Peabody is a genius inventor, who's also a dog and Sherman is his human son. They travel thru time in the WABAC machine, but things go awry when Sherman takes a trip on his own. This spunky animated adventure keeps a zippy pace and relies on fun with puns for most of the laffs. Visually, it's colorful, but none of the characters are especially clever or wacky. While there's a spirited energy and humor that appeals on an intellectual level, nothing about the film is outstanding.",

      "text": "Mr. Peabody and Sherman does its best to work as a film. There is a clear passion behind the film as the writers struggle to make this 5-10 minute cartoon work as an 1 hour and 20 minute film. The solution was to make a mildly entertaining time travel movie similar to Back to the Future Part II full of lots of running around and crazy time travel antics that stays as true as it can to the classic cartoon. Thankfully Dreamworks doesn\u2019t throw in their usual trade of pop culture references and the characters are at their core the characters from the film. Unfortunately, the writer\u2019s solution to stretch the short cartoon into a feature length film that is nothing special. The story while told nicely is quite familiar with a lot of the heartfelt moments while touching cause films like Finding Nemo to come to mind, the new character Penny isn\u2019t interesting being there to give the film somewhere to go, and the film at times, similar to Back to the Future Part II, is so caught up in the running around that it doesn\u2019t take enough time to slow down and have heartfelt moments and the emotion core of the story pops in and out frequently taking a back seat to the action. Despite the comments I don\u2019t hate the movie in fact I thought it was going to be atrocious and destroy a classic cartoon characters. To my surprise the film is charming with its energy, humor, and good animation. There is clear passion behind the film but this duo works better in short cartoons. Children will enjoy and it could serve as an introduction to the superior cartoon it is based off of, which parents if they haven\u2019t seen it please show it to them. I\u2019d probably be more annoyed if I was more attached to the original cartoon but on its own its fine the bummer just comes from knowing that the cartoon is 10x better. Nonetheless, when I look at the pop culture referencing, constantly puns, and pop songs that have dominated a lot of Dreamworks films lately its nice to have something that can make me smile every now and then.",
