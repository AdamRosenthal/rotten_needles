The things that make the book series so successful are the relationships between the characters and we didn't see enough of that due to the god awful pacing and the inner struggle and resilience of rose along with her determination to protect Lissa and that just never really came across. Did it fallow the plot points of the book sort of but it glossed over what should have been the focus the emotion and turmoil instead of the snarky remarks and attempts at memorable one liners none of witch i remember. It is that turmoil and relationship of rose and Lissa that makes it different from twilight or harry potter not making a twilight joke.",

The only thing I thing that would have made it better were (as a book reader) fixing Christian's and Lissa's personalities and the fast-pace.

The real problem was that it just wanted their attention and then fans just skipped the movie and see The LEGO Movie instead. Vampire Academy is pretty much the same and it has a tedious script, poor acting, make absolutely no sense to what the film is about (just in case you've already spend some time shopping at the mall).

It's a shame that it flopped because it had potential but the key issue with the film is that I am not sure who they were trying to market this movie to. Honestly if I hadn't read the book I don't think I would have watched it. They have tried to recreate a Mean Girls style film which is fine because the books are about high school drama but I don't think they sold it to anyone with the trailers and this approach. They would have been better of attempting to go darker as that is the recent trends. Despite this the film is very enjoyable and if you are a fan of Mean Girls and/ or vampires this movie has you covered.",

I did enjoy every little turn out of the events even though I've read the books first. Normally I would always prefer the books to the movies but this one is exceptional I guess. I don't think it's just another cheesy vampire movie neither it is a twisted version of mean girls. It's totally different. Yeah maybe the trailer represented a twisted version of the movie but if you take a leap of faith and watch it, I'm pretty sure you'll like it. The characters were just perfect. I don't know why some people are **** about Zoey playing Rose and Danila playing Dimitri cause they were just incredible. You can see how hard they'd worked for their roles cause every little detail of the book matches. Sure it's not going to be everything like the books you have imagined to be but if you already know everything then what's the fun in that? And trust me when I say, you will not regret watching this movie even if you haven't read the books first cause it's just that incredible. And to some \"any kind of vampire movie haters\" Please don't compare it to Twilight cause it's nothing like that. Like a famous person once said, \"Don't judge the book by its cover\" I'm telling you not to judge the movie by its trailers. Watch it and then regret if you want to but don't do the other way around. The plots were perfect, there was humor, romance and action - All in one movie. I'm looking forward to watch the other sequels of this series so please stop **** and let them make other movie versions of the books. Don't spoil this for the people who have actually enjoyed the movie and are eager to watch the next part. Hell some of you have sat through the whole twilight series, so why can't you show a little bit support on \"Vampire academy\" which by the way is so much better than other typical vampire movies (no offense). And some of you people are complaining about the age thing, well you have the read the books right? So yeah the age gap is supposed to be noticeable. I don't think anyone could've done a better role than the actors and actresses of this movie themselves.",
