Ultimately, the stars of 'Drinking Buddies' give us some fun-enough characters to hang out with for 90 minutes. The true feelings and prerogatives of the main characters are reserved but for a few meaningful moments, of which many are apparent to the audience only. Despite (and perhaps because of) the creative control the actors were given in terms of improvised dialogue, there's a lot of people not saying what they're thinking in this movie.

I don't know if there was a script for this film, because it definitely felt like the cast were improvising. It doesn't matter, though, because their performances were interesting anyway. Especially Olivia Wilde and Jake Johnson.",

      "text": "I had an inkling on how Drinking Buddies was going to end going in but being right didn't mean I didn't enjoy the overall experience because I did. In fact its a smart and well directed film with a fresh improvised style that makes the film performances shine so much that it ultimately didn't matter how the film ended, the ride was enough. The film follows best friends Kate (Olivia Wilde) and Luke (Jake Johnson) who work at a Chicago brewery together. When Kate and Luke introduce each other to their respective partners things start to change for these two friends even though they don't realize it is happening. Director Joe Swanberg, uses his unique filming and story telling techniques to bring new life to a story as old as time. While an unrequited love story is my Kryptonite, Drinking Buddies is the anti rom-com, rom-com as it isn't concerned with the trivial questions of who ends up with who, it's a tale of life  not just for Kate and Luke but everyone. It's a story of personality, how these people interact with each other, warts and all. Joined by Anna Kendrick as Luke's partner Jill and Ron Livingston as Kate's partner Chris. Kendrick turns in yet another stand out performance as a supposedly chilled out yet secretly neurotic girl seeking more from Luke, a man with a serious commitment phobia. Livingston is an unexpected touch but an excellent choice none the less. The real highlight though is Olivia Wilde who proves her worth after a slew of bad film appearances (Cowboys and Aliens,  Ultimately a film like this doesn't come along very often despite Swanberg's impressive film turnout over the last 9 years and we should embrace it for what it is, a heartfelt look at the frustrating nature of man and their ability to miss the simplest of things. While a little long it all comes down to your personal taste as the film is all about the little things, the small inconsequential moments that make up a persons life. If that's not your thing thats fine but if it is your going to love it.",

It all feels very natural and the relationships depicted felt very authentic, making the film all the much better. However, the film certainly lacked that \"it\" factor. It may not be bad, but it certainly was missing that special something that made it good and ultimately, lacked interest at many moments and felt very long for a 90 minute film, which is typically a bad thing. The story flowed well for the most part, though it did feel kind of rushed at times and I thought the story was told well for the most part. In addition, the direction was solid and got the job done. Thus, as a whole, Drinking Buddies is a very made, even if not overly entertaining film that provides just enough to get the job done.",

How life changing. It's a typical story line we've definitely seen before and I couldn't find a single unique element that would make it worth watching. \"But there are so many positive reviews! Why is that?\" I'll tell you why: Olivia Wilde nude (Yeah, big whoop. She has no body whatsoever) The biggest problem I have with this film is that critics called it a Comedy. Really? Show me which part made you laugh because I didn't even count 1 attempt to be funny in the entire film. I'm not even joking. This was the most un-comedic comedy film I have ever seen. If your idea of 'comedy' is a really dull and depressing love triangle with zero jokes, then yeah this is pretty side-splitting. In all seriousness, F*** all the people involved in making this piece of sh**. I should have been weary as soon as I saw the title of the film, which is probably the most un-intriguing, underwhelming choice of words in the history of film.
