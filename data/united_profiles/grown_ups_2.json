Grown Ups (The first one) was quite a heart-warming film, about a group of childhood friends reuniting to bid their Basketball couch farewell, who seemed to have given all of them a sense of purpose and drive to continue their lives into adulthood. The second film, has none of the first movie's seemingly moral stature. There doesn't seem to be any apparent plot, and it merely follows the group of friends around their everyday existence in their neighborhood. There were a few minor chuckles here and there, but with the amount of lame, \"teenage\" toilet humor jokes, it's clear that the only reason this movie had a theatrical release was because of the cast, and I suppose also because they expected the same crowds that flocked to the first installment. This movie was a disappointment, and not worth paying money to watch at the cinema. Wait for dvd, even better, wait till your local broadcaster airs it, because technically it's a bit embarrassing people would contribute to a million plus in box office sales, as it certainly isn't worth it.",

Well the first problem in the movie was the jokes they're so immature it'll only make 9 year olds giggle and that about it.  It's plot doesn't get any better its just a bunch of adults acting like they're 18 and doing stupid crap There's NO POINT IN IT!  The last movie was so much better than this because it actually had something to tell, A story.  But this is Awful why couldn't the movie have some more adult jokes other than a baby talking (Not like i've seen that before *FacePalm*) and a bunch of fart jokes?  Just why Hollywood... Why?",

I have a tougher sell on Pacific Rim because now that Despicable Me 2 is #1 at the box office, the 3-D box office now has an all-time low and it's safe to say that 3-D will be dead as quicker as you think.

Honestly, the only reason this movie was even watchable, and barely, was because of the cameos. Nick Swardson provided almost all of the humor, and guys like Peter Dante, Shaquille O'Neal, Steve Buscemi, and so many more were great as well. There were some smoking hot women in the film too, so that didn't hurt, but honestly, I was very disappointed in this film.",

The movie even appeared to have all the supporting cast from the first movie including Salma Hayek as Roxanne Chase-Feder, Maya Rudolph as Deanne McKenzie, Mario Bello as Sally Lamonsoff, Steve Buscemi as Wiley, Colin Quinn as Dickie Bailey, Tim Meadows as Malcolm, Jake Goldberg as Greg Feder, Cameron Boyce as Keithie Feder, Alexys Nycole Sanchez as Becky Feder, Ada-Nicole Sanger as Donna Lamonsoff, Frank and Morgan Gingerich as Bean Lamonsoff, Nadji Jeter as Andre McKenzie, and China Anne McClain as Charlotte McKenzie.

Initially, I tried really hard to find something positive about this film. Maybe it has some nice shots? Nope. Maybe there's a good performance from Chris Rock? Nope. Maybe it even just has some kind of heart to it? Not a smidgen. I checked the IMDB page and saw Steve Buscemi was in it, so I looked forward to his role. When it finally came I wanted to walk to Townley Park, dig my own grave, lie in it and have someone fill it back in. Not even STEVE BUSCEMI could save this film. That said, he does provides possibly the only slightly genuienly funny moment of this entire pathetic excuse of a film in which he does some mock shadow boxing for 3 seconds. The best performance of the entire film comes in the final 15 minutes from former wrestler: Stone Cold Steve Austin. I don't really know why that was allowed to happen. Taylor Launter appears and he's completely unacceptable as you would expect. This is definitely his biggest role since Twilight. He fully displays why that is the case. If I had to pay a large amount of money within the next 24 hours in order to never have to see this movie ever again, I would find that money. I would beg, steal and probably even kill in order to prevent that. This is right down there with the other worst major comedic efforts of the last decade, possibly at the very bottom. Yes, objectively, this film may well be worse than Yes Man, Mr Popper's Penguins and Jack & Jill. This film, quite frankly, is completely **** disgusting. At one point about thirty minutes in I had to go into Danny's back yard and lie down because I needed both rest AND fresh air.

There are some humorous parts, but for the most part, Grown Ups 2 is a bit of a let down, especially considering that the first film was actually pretty good.",

The difference between this and all the other Happy madison fiascos is that this movie has no redeeming qualities. Pixels was awful but the CG was great. The first Grown Ups was bad, but had a neat concept of a bunch of guys chilling like they did in the good old days (something I might try in a couple of decades.) I'm not even going to mention Jack and Jill. Any ways I'm getting off track.",
