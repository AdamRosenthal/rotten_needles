The second film, has none of the first movie's seemingly moral stature. There doesn't seem to be any apparent plot, and it merely follows the group of friends around their everyday existence in their neighborhood. There were a few minor chuckles here and there, but with the amount of lame, \"teenage\" toilet humor jokes, it's clear that the only reason this movie had a theatrical release was because of the cast, and I suppose also because they expected the same crowds that flocked to the first installment. This movie was a disappointment, and not worth paying money to watch at the cinema.

Beyond the film's exterior, you can see that the children are getting older and the main characters are trying to accept that, but it's just shrouded in crazy jokes. In most parts of the film, vomiting, homosexual undertones and male butts are the butt of the jokes, so it's not for everyone, but I'm pretty sure that teens would love it. Although there are way better comedies out there, this is a guilty pleasure of mine. The film's very colorful and filled with life and it's fun to watch once in a while.

The overall theme in this movie is family life, unrealistic family life, but still family life. You can't walk into a Adam Sandler movie believing your going to see a high powered dramatic movie.

The movie even appeared to have all the supporting cast from the first movie including Salma Hayek as Roxanne Chase-Feder, Maya Rudolph as Deanne McKenzie, Mario Bello as Sally Lamonsoff, Steve Buscemi as Wiley, Colin Quinn as Dickie Bailey, Tim Meadows as Malcolm, Jake Goldberg as Greg Feder, Cameron Boyce as Keithie Feder, Alexys Nycole Sanchez as Becky Feder, Ada-Nicole Sanger as Donna Lamonsoff, Frank and Morgan Gingerich as Bean Lamonsoff, Nadji Jeter as Andre McKenzie, and China Anne McClain as Charlotte McKenzie.

Initially, I tried really hard to find something positive about this film. Maybe it has some nice shots? Nope. Maybe there's a good performance from Chris Rock? Nope. Maybe it even just has some kind of heart to it? Not a smidgen. I checked the IMDB page and saw Steve Buscemi was in it, so I looked forward to his role. When it finally came I wanted to walk to Townley Park, dig my own grave, lie in it and have someone fill it back in. Not even STEVE BUSCEMI could save this film. That said, he does provides possibly the only slightly genuienly funny moment of this entire pathetic excuse of a film in which he does some mock shadow boxing for 3 seconds. The best performance of the entire film comes in the final 15 minutes from former wrestler: Stone Cold Steve Austin. I don't really know why that was allowed to happen. Taylor Launter appears and he's completely unacceptable as you would expect. This is definitely his biggest role since Twilight. He fully displays why that is the case. If I had to pay a large amount of money within the next 24 hours in order to never have to see this movie ever again, I would find that money. I would beg, steal and probably even kill in order to prevent that. This is right down there with the other worst major comedic efforts of the last decade, possibly at the very bottom. Yes, objectively, this film may well be worse than Yes Man, Mr Popper's Penguins and Jack & Jill. This film, quite frankly, is completely **** disgusting. At one point about thirty minutes in I had to go into Danny's back yard and lie down because I needed both rest AND fresh air.
