This true legend of the 47 Ronin doesn't need fireballs and a mystical hair demon lady, it made the experience more cartoonish than serious.  Another dropping point is Keanu Reaves, a random white guy samurai who's acting capability compares to the plank of wood people call Kristen Stewart.  Luckily for this film Hiroyuki Sanada makes up for everything, he is a fantastic actor.  I really enjoyed that they used mostly Japanese actors but again, they're speaking in english.  I do not mean to insult or sound like a jerk but their accents added to the hilariousness of the film.  When the shogunate speaks it's just funny.  This is very unfortunate because Japanese is such a bad ass sounding language filled with great emotion.  Had they allowed the actors to speak Japanese it would have elevated the experience.  But for whatever reason Keanu Reaves had to be there.",

As a Japanophile, I have a great interest in the history, culture and traditions of this amazing country.  This film truly captured the way in which westerners imagine samurai reverence, obedience and loyalty to play out.  Keanu Reeves' role was understated with a sense of great power in restraint, but this worked perfectly as a foil to the other lead roles.  The sets and costumes were staggering in their scale, opulence and detail.  The finale  brought the story of this legend full circle by enforcing the nature of honour which is central to the samurai code.  With the ritual act of seppuku somehow appropriate, rewarding and sad all at once.  I did not expect this film to be so nuanced, imaginative, visually arresting and moving.  As someone who loves visual effects, I was pleased that they were used sparingly and were subservient to the story, while still being flawless and original.  I cannot rationalise the ratings given by critics - did they see a very different picture ?",

The witch is annoying and out of place. The film portrays feudal Japan very convincingly but you keep getting tolkien-esque monsters cropping up all the time that jar against everything else. The action, when it happens, is decent but it's either a famine or a feast. They all commit suicide at the end, which left me feeling very cheated with a feeling of what was all the point of it all. The most frustrating thing is that you could really feel that there was a great film in here that was sunk by all the lousy editing, poor acting and bad plot choices.

Actually fantasy is smartly spread out throughout the movie, keeping the storytelling alive. I was not bored one second while watching it. It is a little odd that 99% of the cast is Japanese yet they are all speaking English. I would rather have seen the movie made in Japanese. But once I got over that, I was fine with it. Keanu Reeves sternness plays well in the Samurai world. I can see why the movie isn't getting a warm reception in the States. Apart from the language, the direction does nothing to cater to American audiences, which are probably used to a faster pace and not as grim an atmosphere for that kind of movie.",

Unfortunately, Reeves has had a taste of his first blockbuster bomb, and after almost 20 years as a recognized Hollywood star, it\u2019s admirable to know that it took this long for him to have a bomb of a film. What\u2019s more admirable in the Reeves canon, however, is how dedicated he is to honouring Asian culture and his constant efforts to preserve the integrity and authenticity of folklore throughout its transition to the big screen. For that, Reeves is an actor who may not be in-line for an Oscar but one who I am proud to call a fine Canadian and preserver of ancient Japanese and Chinese culture.",

I think in a few ways it falls short of a big epic mainstream movie as far as graphics and overall grandeur but I enjoyed it nonetheless. Its often difficult to assimilate Japanese cinema into American cinema. The general ideals and cultures tend to clash a bit and that will effect what is shown on film and how its presented but they found a comfy medium. There was enough conflict and flash to entertain a diverse audience. Its no Last Samurai but it has its strengths and it makes you want to root for the underdog. But the ending is just beyond me, I mean that's where Japanese culture takes over. I just don't understand why that was necessary. But, overall it was a good movie with noble morals.",

Whilst the film encourages the viewer with an exciting start and a potentially thrilling narrative arc, it loses itself in pursuing insignificant plot points and an overwhelming unnecessary presence of fantastical themes. The story of the 47 Ronin is undoubtedly interesting and could perhaps do with a reboot in time, only with less nonsensical magic and more realism.",

      "text": "Like many people I am also shocked at how low this movie is being rated. Sometimes I wonder what is going on in those critics heads. .  First off Every single character that was not lord asano, Kai, or mizuki that is the witch was really good. You see keanu reeves lord asano and the witch all have something in common. It seems like they could care less. I didn't have a satisfying feeling when either of the villains died because they were not evil enough. The idea of a half breed was interesting but his character did not have enough good backstory to make us care about him. It didn't help keanu reeves's deadpan emotionless acting he brought to the role either. This movie succeeds in incredible cinematography, a compelling story and fantastic and exciting action sequences this defiantly was a lot better than what the critics were making it out to be. It just could have been better if the half breed character was out of the picture and we had more evil villains played by better actors would have made this story about honor friendship and love all the better.",

But despite this long tradition of flexible reinterpretation, the Hollywood-backed \u201c47 Ronin\u201d takes such liberties with the underlying legend that a different term comes to mind, one better suited to American actor Keanu Reeves\u2019 involvement: \u201cbogus.\u201d So far, Japanese audiences have been slow to embrace a CG-heavy version of the story that offers Keanu as a previously unsung \u201chalf-breed\u201d accomplice. Meanwhile, domestic crowds are being deliberately misled to think he\u2019s the star \u2014 a high-stakes bait-and-switch sure to backfire on this narratively stiff but compositionally dazzling production when it opens Dec. 25 in the U.S.",
