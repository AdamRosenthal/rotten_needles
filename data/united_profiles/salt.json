Couple examples which using the similar patterns are: John Travolta FROM PARIS WITH LOVE (2009), Tom Cruise KNIGHT AND DAY (2010), Ashton Kutcher KILLERS (2010) and now it is Jolie turn. The story follows Evelyn Salt (Jolie) who has been instant-accused as a Russian spy who may be able to jeopardizing the national security. The Director is Phillip Noyce, the man behind THE BONE COLLECTOR in 1999 (also with Jolie). The camera angle is dynamic, especially in action sequences. Yes, the movie is full of twists and turns, even sometimes the story just go by itself without proper explanations, leaving too many questions and missing links. That is the uniqueness of the plots! The story is intriguing. It is successful to make us stay put in our seat by expecting what is going to happen next. To let Jolie fuses into action adventure like thiz is like releasing the fish into water, it is what she does best. Jolie is still the focus, shines among her mysterious partner (Liev Schreiber) and plain-straight boss (Chiwetel Eijiofor). If someone complains about how absurd thiz narratives has become, it is simply arguable and it all happens to every modern action movies. One thing for sure, Jolie is back with some kiss-ass moves, to show us she is definitely one of the most comfortable action heroines in our time.

Another example: Salt displays Bourne's preternatural foresight, but didn't manage to see ANY of this coming until she was 'activated'/set-up?). Obviously the filmakers have circumvented this by simply not giving the audience an opportunity to think about the plot by freneticly jumping from one death-defying cliff-edge punch-up to another for nearly two hours. This is a film that requires you to simply turn off your brain as we are expected to believe that an anorexic-looking waif of woman can outwit the Russians, the Americans and shoot, karate-chop and punch her way through what, at times, seems like the entire US governmental apparatus, intelligence services and military complex.

But the plot to this movie seems to be mired in an over abundance of action sequences and chase sequences and to add on top of all that the film clocks out at a measly 1hr. 39 min which leaves little for character development or story development but truth be told does a  movie like this  really  need all that? I don't think so. This film is more reliant on its action, stunts, chases, and Angelina Jolie's excellent performance as Evelyn Salt. This film has so many plot holes that you could drive a semi truck through it  is the epitome of over the top action  with each and every sequence delivering one brilliant filmed yet  outrageously implausible stunt after another.

Of course, the driving force is Angelina Jolie as Evelyn Salt, a CIA agent who is accused of being a Russian spy. Salt is altogether a static character, but shifts in narrative constantly make our view of her dynamic, no knowing whether to pin her as hero or antihero, and Jolie plays this ambiguity to perfection. The movie itself isn't perfect, though - to me, occasional plot holes made it more confusing than \"Inception,\" and the idea of a Cold War carry-over in this day and age is somewhat laughable. Still, the movie plays its thrills right, and character of Salt fulfills what she was written to be - a bona fide action star.",

The plot itself takes a turn once or twice and keeps you hooked until the end. If you have to compare this film to any other out there, I'd say 'The Bourne Identity' gets real close. Though if I have to name anything that's negative, well... it's a movie you watch once... after that the fun is gone since this movie is based on surprises and excitement only. Also it's nothing new, we've seen films like this before.... but don't get me wrong, 'SALT' is still very enjoyable.",

It's nothing ground-breaking as we have seen this before but its very entertaining as there is some genuinely incredible action sequences. The story is somewhat confusing at times to say the least yet somehow intriguing as you try to work out just who Salt is. The area where Salt does deliver is in the entertainment. Whether its the action sequences or the element of surprise and excitement it is a throughly watchable film. As i've said before SALT is certainly nothing fresh its been done before, Bourne anyone? Ofcourse the intriguing element is the story and background and that makes it ever so slightly different but also given the fact its a female its a very good alternative from the macho, muscle assassin on the run. All in all Salt is a hugely enjoyable film with plenty on offer and while the story is far from straightforward its certainly worth a watch plus with the way the movie ends I think its natural to assume this isn't the last time we'll be seeing Angelina Jolie as Salt, this movie may well kickstart another franchise!",

If not, what was the whole point of sneaking into the Whitehouse bunker when she changed her mind? Why does Salt go so far to kill Ted when the president is alive? Why would Russia want to bring US down in these days, when cold war has been over for decades?[Let's save this one if I'm bringing in too much reality into movies] Is agnt Peabody the only one who can possibly know that Salt saved the day? Why does Salt have to go through dark knight thing when there is enough evidence --fingerprint at Orlov's-- and she can prove she did what she meant to do?) It seems to me, the story was squeezed and twisted way too much just for the sake of looking cool.",

This is an action packed thriller that will have you on the edge of your seat the whole time. Is it predictable? A little, but there are just enough surprises to keep you thinking. It's not the most realistic story, but it works for the type of movie it is. Many people probably will rip all over this film because it's not perfect, but it does it's job, and I see absolutely nothing wrong with that.  It is more than entertaining! I highly recommend this movie.",
