I realize the concept was his, and it was a nifty concept, but leave it to Brett Ratner to be the poor man's Michael Bay: occasional flashes of interest, but no knowledge of how to tell a story via film.  The highlights were Gabourey Sidibe, who steps up during the funniest moment in the movie versus an FBI guard, and Matthew Broderick, who looks so old and chubby, but pulls off a teetering-on-the-edge former stock broker who has lost it all.

If you have a fear of heights, as I do, there is a prolonged scene during the heist that will make you squirm in your seat!  Alan Alda always makes a good bad guy, as he first proved in a Woody Allen film years ago.  I thought the acting across the board was good, and the film was shot well.  The only part that didn't work so well for me was Gabourey Sidibe.  Her acting is OK, but her weird Jamaican accent comes and goes.  There was no reason for the accent so they shouldn't have added it.  Not a great film but good.  Recommended, especially if you like Eddie Murphy.",

Anybody familiar with some of Ben Stiller's movies, such as Zoolander and Meet The Parents, knows that he's capable of producing some absolutely memorable material. The worst part about Tower Heist is that my only laugh throughout the entire movie didn't come from Ben Stiller but from Eddie Murphy. What's worse than that is that this isn't even Eddie Murphy's worst movie (or Ben Stiller's considering last year's Little Focker's). Skip this one. Instead, go rent Ocean's Eleven.",

This movie did surprise me though, aside from it's lame jokes, there is substance here, which include a pretty good story and an interesting cast. Ben Stiller is terrific as usual, but Eddie Murphy was not. I was never a big fan to begin with, but in recent years he has completely lost the ability to be funny and carry a film, the way he did with the Beverly Hills Cop series. Usually Murphy is an asset, injecting humor into an otherwise dry plot, but here his appearance actually takes away from the film. His character is both forced and uninteresting and I'd go as far as to say that this movie would have been better, if Eddie Murphy's character was just eliminated altogether. As I said earlier, the previews don't do this film justice and if you base what you're going to watch solely on previews, than you probably didn't see Tower Heist, and you're missing out. It is an interesting movie, that's different, and has a couple of twists in the story. Not an award winner by any means, but it's certainly something that will entertain you for a couple of hours.",
