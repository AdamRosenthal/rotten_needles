You could call the entire plot from start to finish within the first 20 minutes of the film and that sort of ruins the movie. The acting is so-so, None of the cast are given a chance to shine and Hamm proved to be a rather...disappointing and lackluster lead. Overall, If you can stomach generic sports films then sure give it a chance. If you are tired of the same old, same old then you are better off avoiding this one.",

Jon Hamm is in a role that is very similar to his role as Don Draper in Mad Men. He is focused on making money and is an obvious womanizer. Despite the similarities I like him in the lead role and he continues to develop as the story goes on. Million Dollar Arm is a movie that is worth watching. A must see for any sports fan and a good family movie.",
