In a nutshell it is a pro-veganism, pro-ecology,pro-self-hating,pro-social isolation and anti-progress gritty reboot of the known tale of the Bible. The main problem with this movie and its most unforgivable trait is that it tries sadistically hard to enforce those ideals to the viewer, to the point that it makes the viewer actually hate the protagonist and his headstrong self-righteous opinions. The society it shows of Sodom and Gomorrah is clearly a parallel of our society today. The only things that differentiate it is the lack of iphones and presence of rugs. 'We are evil and deserve to be destroyed' he preaches. 'It is a crime against nature to eat an animal' he says and insinuates by showing a man gutting a lamb with his bare hands and eating it raw. This is the work of a raging misanthropist wrapped in a Michael Bay exterior so the masses he hates so much will flock  and pay to watch his delirium.   Despite sharing some of his views,I cannot help but hate this unprecedented ideological enforcement and the movie as a whole as a result. If you can ignore all of the above, the movie has some strong visuals and performances by the cast and maybe you should give it a go. If not stay away.",

If you are going to do a historic piece, you should at least try to keep the story correct. only the names re the same and there is an arc full of animals and birds, etc.  that is where it ends being the story of noah.  Cain kills Able and starts an industrial society, according to the narrator, but since when did people in an industrialized society still run around in ragged clothes and animal skins and use clubs and swords?  And then fallen angels come down to help mankind and are crusted with volcanic rock as punishment from God.  That's so wrong, I'm not even going there. And it just gets worse.  Noah is supposedly given the decision to save or destroy all of mankind, by God, and he chooses to destroy all. so this is offensive  not only Christians, but to anyone who ever saw a great story come to screen, and it was all screwed up by Hollywood.",

I know Conelly is a great drama actress, and I like her, but this movie should be about Noah, God and The Sundering, not about Noahs wife nerves and arguing. I watch movies to enjoy the plot, decorations or actors play, but spitting tears and saliva at the face of Noah is quite disgusting. Scenes of pregnancy and birth accompanying by Watson screams is even more disgusting. This movie is dirty - this is the right word - dirty and dark.

The problem is, it doesn't really have many merits. This film was simply two hours and fifteen minutes of tedium. The special effects are barely worthy of a SyFy Channel original film. The acting is overly hammy and in some cases mind-numbingly wooden, part of which I feel is the part of the script, which eschews actually writing good dialogue for what seems to be just spewing out statements at random. The editing ranges in style from choppy to lingering overly long on mundane, uninteresting scenes. Everything is just...off. As bad as everything else felt, the score was possibly worse. I've never had issue with the work of Clint Mansell before, but for Noah he's opted for a blaring two note score that just keeps screaming the same two flipping horn blasts in your face over and over again. This is also the first time I would ever describe Aronofsky's directing as \"ham-fisted\". Everything feels overdone, self-indulgent and overproduced. I usually walk out of a Darren Aronofsky film contemplating the themes and mulling it over in my head to uncover deeper meanings. This one only stayed with me as a bad memory.",

The story of Noah and the ark is a very old, well respected, and loved story, many people believe those events really occurred. When you get the chance to make a movie that stems directly from The Holy Bible, you would think it would stay knit at the waist with it as far as accuracy and tone. Aronofsky is obviously not a religious man, otherwise he would have had much more respect for the story of Noah and the nature of the characters involved. Portraying Noah, who has been said to have been directly guided by God to save the human race and its righteous moral ideals, as a crazed lunatic who spends most of the movie dazed and confused about his purpose who needs help from giant rock people and who eventually is convinced he needs to kill his family, is quite a slippery direction to take. it doesn't seem to paint a pretty picture of God or his followers. Though I will note that that the title \"God\" was not even used once in the entire film. From the artsy perspective, this was a well done unique piece of movie making. That explains why a simple bible story made it to such a large scale movie in this day and age. It was warped. Severely. The graphics were impressive and dazzling, the acting performances were polished and sharp, it was coordinated well. But the point of telling the story of Noah and his trials with the flood and the rest of a wicked world and a wicked people, and his dealings with God, got completely lost. Way to go.

Settle down. Be thankful that someone in HOLLYWOOD actually made a movie about this biblical tale. Now, time to review.  Darren Aronosky (hope I spelled that right) is at it again with one of the most destructive and action-packed tales from the Bible. Who better to do it? Noah is a home run in terms of movie making and sits along with Requiem of a Dream and Black Swan in a stalemate. Everybody in the movie does a fantastic job and all feel equal in terms of skill and screen time. While it doesn't have as much action as you'd expect, the drama is still amazing and even sad at times. Speaking of action, what you do get is phenomenal. Giant rock men fighting against regular men with armor and spears, destructive water effects, and my jaw was open so many times during the action. But sadly, I felt there wasn't enough. I'd never want it to be a Michael Bay kind of movie, but if I got 15-30 minutes more of action, I'd be very satisfied. Another flaw I noticed was that it can be a little hard to follow at times. A few times I thought to myself \"OK...let me think this over...\". While the story can be harsh at times, I appreciated these parts and they make the movie feel like something different. There's so much more to say, but you should already get the gist that you should see this movie. It's worth every penny.",

If you want to watch a deeper than usual exploration of the nature of God with fully humanized Biblical characters, strongly stated moral questions, and striking visual effects, you may just about love it. I fall into the latter category, and would happily recommend this film on the basis of moral and spiritual exploration and exposition, not as an historical set piece.",

I am not talking about the dinner with the love of my life eating the love of my life, Pizza, leading up to the movie. I am not talking about the romantic walk towards each other that ended up in hot steamy kiss up against the glass of shop on the street outside the theatre. I walked to the street corner after I purchased the tickets for the movie and as I turned my head to my left I saw her, it was like the first time I had seen this woman but I felt the energy from a block away, I knew she had me in her sites. I knew she was determined to run into me, I felt compelled to meet her half way and run into her just as determined. Our bodies collided like two galaxies in outer space. There is no collision more graceful than that of two galaxies. So large, so great, so passionate that when they collide the planets that make them up never hit. The two beautiful forces of our universe dance like they are in love until they settle into one new galaxy. That was us right there on the sidewalk under the streetlight at night just like in the movies. However this is not the first I am speaking of. The night was young and the movie had yet begun. After having a few laughs at the tavern next door, we walked through the crystal clear glass that lead to our horror. With a big bag of mouthwatering popcorn in one hand and a genetically engineered fructose corn syrup soup in the other. Sitting in the third row, we were traditionally set for our feature presentation starring, Rustle Crow. At first I am moved, pulled in by the selflessness of Noah and his sons. I thought I was proud to be in this crowd, so glad to see a movie that did not promote bad. However it was at this moment that I witnessed something I had never seen before! Something that totally made sense but yet none at all. I needed to take a picture so people would believe me when I share it on social media with the world to save them from making the same mistake we made that beautiful night. To save them from not only having to watch this movie but from possibly facing the same fate of those around me. To my right it was happening. Directly in front of me it was happening, I turned to look behind me and it was happening all around me. I thought at first, its ok, this is a dream, pinch yourself you fool this can\u2019t happen in real life. It hurt, I was not sleeping, not yet, but if I subjected myself to this anymore I could end up doing just that. Doing what all the sinners around me were doing, engaging in what seemed to be either a mass suicide attempt or possibly a slumber party. People were sleeping not only around me but on each other. The young couple to my right fell asleep leaning against each other. The mother who sat in front of me separating her husband and son started snoring. People all around were speechless as we were subjected to the glorious acting out of a phycodic script obviously written or directed by a white male animal lover who probably has small ligaments. A white man that feels inferior to woman and children. Scared that one day people will wake up and realize that this is not a white man\u2019s world. But a natural habitat for humanity. Scared that people will realize there is no one greater than our creator who is genderless and colorless. This movie features 100% people with a white ethnic background and a man who tells his sons that he does not believe there should be kings for there is no man greater than our creator. But after the king and his men are killed by the water from above Noah becomes a King, President, Dictator, Ruler, CEO whatever you want to call it, its all the same. He decided who lives and who dies. He decides who will go and who will stay regardless of the thoughts of the people who make up his pride. A man who believes that woman are to serve man and bear children. Only if he wants them to. He cares not what other humans say, he is only interested in carrying out the decisions that take place in his own mind and claims that they are orders from above, from the almighty who works threw no one other than himself. He believes that humans are not animals, that its only ok for lions to eat other animals, for if a human eats another animal he is eating the forbidden fruit. He supports the idea that killing mass quantities of humans is justified for the humans are all sinners. My take on this movie is that if you believe you are getting orders from god, you should act them out regardless of the thoughts of others around you even if it involves killing babies that are one day old or making mankind extinct. That murdering most the world population if not all is not only justified but glorious in the evolution of our Garden of Eden which we of the modern world refer to as planet earth, the third rock from the sun.",

Darren Aronofsky, usually one of the best visual directors around, takes a fair while to bring his undoubted talent to the fore concentrating instead on character development and uninteresting family dialogue. Even the visual effects, including some rock monsters that look as if they have just stepped out of a Transformers movie, seem dislocated from everything else going on at this time. In fact, it's not until the tremendous battle for the ark that things start to improve. From here, it's onwards and upwards and the cast finally have some dialogue and drama to sink their teeth into. A crazed Russell Crowe starts to lose it; Jennifer Connelly steals the acting honours in just two scenes; Emma Watson cries a lot, but shows real promise here, and even Ray Winstone is rather good in a baddie role that he can play in his sleep.",

However, its message was thrown at you in a way that pissed me off. This idea that god would kill off the bad is a good thing, but to let the good suffer along with them is stupid. The loss of mental control of Noah wasn't something I was taught but maybe it was true. I'm right on the fence with this one; until I read the actually story (which is something I need to do).  Maybe the story was true which would piss me off more than I'm already at. In the context of the bible of course. Stories of things that I believe were put there to tell the world what is wrong and right. Nothing to be interpreted as real life. So if this was the real story of Noah, then I've lost most my fate in the Bible all together. The story of how one man could get something wrong from god was good and the extent of his awakening was pretty satisfying. Though the decision of Noah to go to that extent where he thinks god is telling him he should kill kids is ridiculous and I wouldn't want a god like that. Though his revaluation at the end kind of made up for it. So at this point its more of a good movie than a bad, but I've got to read the story to see how much the movie is true to it. 7.6/10",

Father Gatto would be proud.) And yes, the Bible provided for wives for the three sons as they entered the ark, and there was no stowaway, but those deviations from the literal Genesis chapters are done for dramatic effect, and they don't take away from the essential meaning of the passages - that man had become corrupt, and God sought Noah's help to begin things again.  I also didn't have a problem with the angels/rock-monsters - they were a convention to explain how such a small group could build such a massive structure in such a short time, while keeping the bad dudes at bay. The movie flagged a bit as Noah was convinced God would want him to take the life of his would-be granddaughter. The visual effects are amazing in this movie, and the leading actresses (Jennifer Connelly & Emma Watson) are outstanding.  Great to see such strong women represented in a Biblical interpretation.  As a friend of mine advised, it might be helpful to read Genesis 5 - 9 twice - just before and directly after you see the movie, simply to put things in context.",

Though, I think much of the divisiveness surrounding this one is due to many religious folk walking in and expecting a re-enactment of the Bible word-for-word with no added elements and no alteration of anything.

Jennifer Connelly is also alright (though there is one scene where she struggled pretty badly). I also enjoyed many of the added elements, such as the Watchers (the rock creatures). They received the most criticism from hardcore Christians, but for me, I loved what they added to the film and their journey was just as riveting as that of Noah. Up until the flood, this film is brilliant. Post-flood, however, things begin to follow apart (while I liked Winstone's acting, I don't like his character being added and it all felt so cliche). However, it does pick back up again towards the end and convinces me there is brilliance in this somewhat broken film. The cinematography is very consistently beautiful. Some of the shots here are absolutely gorgeous (by some I mean the vast majority). The direction from Darren Aronofsky is also characteristically strong here and while this may not be my favorite film by him, it is still a great example of his talent. Overall, Noah is far from perfect, but is a solid film that does not try to be a Bible film, so do not come expecting that. Rather, it is more along the line of apocalyptic epic,",

The effects are solid but occasionally cheesey.  Animals sometimes look too obviously fake.  The flood itself however was very realistic looking.  The script is pretty decent.

I am a Christian, My relationship with God and his son Jesus is the most important thing in my life! Now with that being said, I absolutely loved Noah! Do not listen to what all of the people are saying about this film. Yes, it does have one particular element where the director obviously took some creative liberties with the story but to me that was okay. The story of Noah is one of the shortest in the Bible, and a lot of the details are left to your imagination. That is where this film comes in, it shows the dark side of Noah. The stories we heard when we were little kids are the same stories per say, but they are much much darker than we could understand. Which is exactly what I loved about this film! Instead of exploring humans through the eyes of God like so many other movies do, this explores God through the eyes of his servants. It shows their struggles, their sacrifices, their doubts and ultimately how strong their relationship with their creator must be in order to make it in this harsh world! Noah is one of the best films I saw all year! If you are a Christian, or even if you're not, give it a try. I'm sure you will be glad you did!",

One of several deluge myths in ancient middle and near east religion. What Aronofsky does is mint a new version, and it works. Expectedly on some levels, as Aronosky uses typical visual inventiveness to tell the story. One highlight is the creation story-within-the-story interlude which is dazzling, another are his invention of the Watchers, and their nod to both Giacometti and Ray Harryhausen. But also unexpectedly, as we are, for the most part rooting for good Old Testament Yahweh and his plans to cleanse the world, such is Aronofsky's ability to depict it as relentlessly mired in vice, and in doing so hold an uncomfortable mirror up to our own rapaciousness. But this would be for nought if Crowe couldn't make the role work. He does, giving Noah pathos, intensity, a deep inner sadness. It's dark, it drags a bit if you're not lapping up the art direction, and arguably loses it's way a little in the final third, redeeming itself at the very end, but this is bold, intelligent film-making in a different league to the vacuous output of someone like Michael Bay. In time will be appreciated as a minor masterpiece.",

The movie was filled with little continuity errors, and overall screw-ups. It didn't have a great start, and then got gradually better, it then got to an incredibly well-shot action scene which definitely upped my review, but, it then got boring and predictable, it went on for far too long and didn't have the intrigue that Aronofsky's other films have clearly shown.

It's a lose-lose situation, which is a crying shame, because it's most probably Aronofsky's greatest work since Requiem for a Dream. Very inspired decision reuniting A Beautiful Mind's stars Russell Crowe and Jennifer Connelly, while Sir Anthony Hopkins really shines as Earth's oldest human being (Noah's grandfather Methuselah), it has the best acting I've seen from Emma Watson, and Ray Winstone is very good as the villain.

I was also very confused about how the \"ark\" was seemingly completely stationary (seemed a lot more like a large cargo container) but survived the flood. It was not as high as the mountains and those got covered with water so how did that ark not get covered with water. There was a filler section that showed Noah talking about man killing each other and it showed shadows of men with machine guns...Also, the end where it showed all the different animals and their babies should have had \"copyright of the Discovery channel\" because it really looked like stock footage. Some of it was even in standard definition. There was absolutely no emotional connection to the characters.",

However combine that with a story many centuries old, and mix it with a madman who carries the name Noah, and throw in some random rock people, and this movie becomes plain disrespectful. Battle scenes? Rubbish. Lame tactics (they only charged and used infantry, no cavalry, siege engines, or arrows, javelins, shields, not even slings!), men with no swords, and this adds on to the level of disrespect this movie brings on. If you're Jewish or strongly Catholic, this will not make you happy at all.",

      "text": "If you didn't tell who the director of the new Noah movie was I would assume almost immediately that it was Michael Bay, not the talented Darron Aronovsky that everyone has come to know. I'm not rating this movie from a Biblical standpoint because everyone should know by now that it isn't accurate at all. (fallen angels that look like rock versions of Optimus Prime, no wives for the other two sons, someone actually getting into the ark) This movie is being completely rated based completely on the production which is sorely lacking in an interesting story. First the good is that the leads do an excellent job of acting the story out and Ruselle Crowe hasn't looked this alive in a movie in about ten years. The scenery is also quite the spectacle and the special effects are almost Bay-like and definitely had a lot of money put into them. That money was spent in vain though. First this movie needed an actual script that didn't sound like it was written by a five year old. Some of the one liners in this movie are actually almost painful to listen too. The acting by a few of the minor characters is awful. The directing by Aronovsky almost seems like the man is truly confused. He almost doesn't even seem to know where this movie was going. The score is almost too ridiculous for its own good. Its constantly too epic and blasts practically throughout the entire movie even when a scene doesn't have any tension whatsoever. Ultimately the bad outweighs the good in this movie. Anybody into explosions and Transformers will be into this film but anyone who actually wants to see a good movie might as well steer clear of this one.",
