Dashner is a real genius for what he wrote and for the way he wrote it but the movie just ruined the mystery of the book. Through the pages, you learnt together with the Gladers to know the place around you and you came to understand it and eventually you figured out all the secrets of the Maze. This way, the movie lost the magic and transformed everything in a medium quality thing. The characters are wrong (almost all of them but Newt and partly Thomas), the values are wrong, the philosophy that rules the Glade and the Maze is wrong.. not to talk about the riddle to escape...  I will stop here... The movie really sucks if compared to the book.",

There were far too few of the latter, but enough to keep you in the game.  After Elysium and The Giver (among others), do we really need another evil, manipulative, corporate, blond sleazebag at the center of the controversy?  Could the bad guy be any more simplified and obvious?  As I understand it, the screenwriters actually toned the bad guy down too, which makes one wonder how ridiculous he was in the book.  Do we really need an ending that is 100% about the franchise?  It was so clearly tailored to be the launch of a movie franchise that I actually heard a notable gasp in the theater, which is not a good sign.  The only meaningful female character had no story and no point, other than as a plot device (which could have been accomplished other ways).  They don't even deal with the clear sexual tension of dropping a single young female into a world of adolescent males, which is cowardice.  But, I actually liked the movie. It was, more or less, well paced.  The conflict seemed honest.  The young male actors were pretty good, though it was hard to see the bad guy being portrayed by the kid from \"We're the Millers.\"  The monsters were an interesting combination of organic and technology, but were otherwise unexplained.  At the end, one is left with the notion that this could end up being a good story, but that this is only a limp preamble.  I hope this is the case, as I would like to see what happens next.",

No progression. It also really bothered me how the many questions were raised in dialogue were never addressed...ever. It was just hole after hole in the story that just could not be saved by the complication of the maze or the crazy monster/alien things that were graphed on to robotic technology...just how far in the future are they if they can do that? And if they can do that then it kind of trivializes the whole idea of using the maze for child experimentation anyway doesn't it? I'm sorry, I wanted to like this, the previews made me curious, but I've been had. Most of the time in the theater was spent wondering what in the world is going on, and not the good kind of wondering. All in all i was waiting for the movie to finish long before it did and the ending didn't seem to clarify much of anything, just raise more questions...I mean...what is the point of the female in this? She does nothing. Not even touching the fact that they threw her in a forest with of bunch of teenage guys who haven't seen a  girl in years and there's not even so much as a catcall at her...really? You think they'd be so proper? And how do they stay so well shaven and got such nice fade haircuts when they live how they do? not even stubble? Minor problem I'll admit but it didn't help the world they were trying to create the feeling ya know and the tone was all wrong the casting was weak in some spots, there was emotion just in all the wrong places, I just get upset thinking about how awful this movie is, when it had high potential...this is long..last thing, you launch a franchise because your first film was solid, you don't launch a film because you think your franchise is solid.

That point aside, the entire movie was extremely tense, i was always fearing a character would die at any moment, i was extremely scared during the moments the characters encountered the main enemy in the movie. The movie may not be as good as the novel, not going as deep into themes and topics. But i can easily forgive any film that is an adaptation from a novel for this, they are taking a novel, something that takes readers hours with many breaks in-between to finish, and cramming it into a two hour flick that anyone can come and watch all at once. Of course the movie won't be as deep the main reason for that simply being it is a movie, not a book.",

I was hoping that like The Hunger Games, The Maze Runner would be a page for page telling of the story, but it wasn't and in fact several important elements crucial to the sequels were left out. The story begins with a boy named Thomas (Dylan O'Brien) waking up in an elevator, surrounded by dozens of other boys. Thomas has no memory other than his name and quickly learns that none of the other boys do either. They are all trapped in the middle of a maze with no idea why or how to escape. This film was done well, but compared to the book, it is like a seventh graders book report. All the players are the same and the events are relatively the same, but all those little things that made this series so special and unique were left out. The film is just a simple story with some terrific special effects, but the book was really extraordinary and non-readers will never have any idea of just how good this movie could have been. Teen Wolf's Dylan O'Brien stars and really was the perfect choice to play Thomas. Unlike some of the other casting choices, O'Brien really seems to jump right from the pages to the screen in a defining role that almost seemed made for him. Thomas was the same in the movie as he was in the book, but he was the only one. It's very hard to be objective about this, because if I hadn't read the book, I still would have enjoyed the film, but realizing just how much of the story is missing really bothers me and skewed my review of the film. The story is unique, the special effects are great, and their some very good young actors here, I still highly recommend The Maze Runner, but if you are a reader and you enjoy Science Fiction, by all means read the book first.",

I bring this up for the reason that the closing scenes lose importance because of this fault in adaptation (I will retrain fom spoilers). Basically we are forced to admire the main character and load his opposite simply on the premise of the books, whose context is absent. The viewer is quickly told who to hate, and without context from the books, this makes the characters and entire film extremely one dimensional. Combine this general flaw, seen in most novel adaptations, with the fact that the starting storyline is ruined by the lame excuse of an ending. The actual maze and the mystery surrounding it held interest in me long until we are shown it's purpose in relation to the characters. Hopefully the follow up will be long enough to develop the cast's roles to legitimately care for their characters. Or not...I won't be watching either way.",

      "text": "Seems to be riding the wave of the \"let's make a movie out of a series of books and target it to teenagers for some reason\" craze that people turned into a thing after Harry Potter and possibly LOTR.  The movie was actually halfway decent, with an interesting, shifting maze to explore, and a bizarre scenario in which the characters found themselves.  Too bad the movie spent about 60% of its time focused on the encampment, rather than out exploring the maze.  Also, I was very upset that we only got to see the characters learn and uncover secrets of the maze rather than getting to uncover the mysteries ourselves.  Rather than present any sort of mystery to the audience for any length of time, it felt like we were quickly shown solutions to mysteries in hindsight, or in passing.  The maze exploration was the best part of the movie, but only accounted for about 5% of it.  Another 25% of the movie was action sequences that were also halfway decent, but didn't substitute for much less budget-intensive mystery, suspense or exploration.",

Although For me it felt like the movie left out a lot of details the book had but im not even sure if that's true because i haven't read the books yet but after watching this im thinking about checking them out. The first half of the film is pretty slow but tells you what you need to know while the second half pretty much serves as the action part of the movie but even then it seemed like it never really took off i guess that's because this is just the beginning in what looks to be another franchise. Maybe the second film will have a bigger budget so the effects can look better im mean yeah sure they looked great in this considering the films 34 million dollar budget but i think they still can improve on it. The cast was solid although i did find Will Poulter's character \"Gally\" pretty annoying and i could never take him serious as a tough guy also i pretty much knew from the start that Chuck was going to die.",

However there are some clich\u00e9s hidden in there that seem to arise in any movie for teenagers. The main character has an unneeded amount of courage and the protagonist hates him for really no reason at all. However the movie is a complete mystery in the beginning but the writer managed to tie all the ends up by the ending.

Im not going to pretend i've read the book, but the film was disappointing. So many things were poorly done, the way the group are always vague to the main character because instead of them saying what normal people say they have to be vague just to add more pointless mystery. The acting of a lot of these actors is also fairly poor and the ending \"video\" is a complete **** of exposition for no other reason than to try and get some interest in you going to the cinema to see the impending sequel. As it ends and shows the vastness of the maze you begin to realise that these people built an immensely large maze in hope that it may tell them something about why these children are immune. In my opinion if I was asked to describe the film in one word it would be \"Absurd\"",
