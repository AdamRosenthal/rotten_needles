The trailer continued at least half of the truly funny moments in the movie, of which there were precious few.  It starts off fairly strong, but loses almost all steam in the painful-to-watch scenes involving Rudd's character's \"stalker.\"  The first scene just sucked the life out of the movie, and it doesn't really regain its footing until near the end, and even then still can't capture the strength of the first 15-20 minutes.  I really like the cast, but unfortunately the jokes just weren't there, and instead we get a movie that can't decide if it wants to be funny or poignant and winds up neither.",

Scene by scene you slowly begin to realize that the \"aha\" moment is just not coming. I didn't laugh out loud once, and barely managed a grin. In fact, I found myself so disinterested by the halfway point that I only paid attention so that I could give a fair review. There was certainly little entertainment value to be found. What is probably most disappointing is that the very title of the film and main event on which it bases it's story only lasts a few minutes. That's right, there is roughly an hour and a half build-up to the actual \"dinner with schmucks.\" And believe me, there is no payoff. In hindsight, I should have skipped this one altogether.

Rudd's character was an even bigger idiot for putting up with Barry as long as he did. Finally, Lucy Punch's \"mistress\" character was beyond stupid. She was so good in \"Bad Teacher,\" and yet so terrible in this. Jay Roach's career as a director has gone down the crapper. He was promising in the late 90s when he started the \"Austin Powers\" franchise, but then the \"Meet the Parents\" trilogy was two movies too long (though to be fair he did not direct, only produced, the third film), and now with \"Dinner for Schmucks,\" he has hit as close to rock bottom as you can get without actually hitting rock bottom. Give the lady who played the \"lobster woman\" bigger parts in more movies. Everyone else needs to dial it back a notch and think more about the types of scripts/roles they choose.",
