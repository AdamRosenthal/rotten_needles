While sequels tend to suck the idea of going into the future could lead to some good satire but rather than explore that they just get lazy and do a bunch of laughs. I could criticize this film for ripping off Back to the Future Part II but those are too different genres and several gags in this film do work and had the film been smarter about its humor and hadn\u2019t hit the lazy button it could\u2019ve been entertaining.

This is one of the worst sequel of the year and that's a good thing. Thank goodness I skipped to this waste and see Kingsman instead. I love the entire cast (even though Lisa Loeb made a cameo), but the rest of the movie is just awfully bad. The script is lame, same humor jokes but little less fun, and I don't know what's worst, this or last year's Sex Tape. I guess HTTM2 is just not as bad as I think, but it's the sequel nobody wanted or asked for.",

I went to a 7:45 showing with my 21 yr old son (a bonding night, LOL) and there were only 2 other people in the theater. I'm actually surprised it got an MC rating as high as 31. I've watched Master of Disguises (got a 12) and that seems like a comedy classic next to this one.",

Hot Tube 2 picks up where the first one left off, They are all rich and taking advantage of there knowledge of the future as much as they can. This does make for a few funny scenes but then shorty after that the story Shifts to being about finding who shot Lou in the Dick..This is where I find the movie starts to fall apart, Jokes start becoming weird or just overdone, It just starts to feel immature and not anywhere similar to the original. The acting is good from the 4 main characters but it makes it that much worse that the writers couldn't come up with better material for the characters, especially with Hot Tub 1 to work off of. It is kind of sad when the trailer for you movie looks better then it really is, and sadly all the parts from said trailer are in the end credits.",
