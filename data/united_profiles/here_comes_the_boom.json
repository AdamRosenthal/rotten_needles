A few chuckles and laughs through out. Bas Rutten was suprisingly rather good in this movie and definently stole the show imo. Did not care for Salma Hayek at all though and felt that she was incredibly out of place in this movie. The rest of the cast did ok. Overall, If you can deal with a corny ending, It's worth giving a shot. Not as bad as critics say imo.",

The character and his goal to help the poor musical teacher who is passionate for his music. Kevin James acting was very good and solid, though I feel that some other characters didn't not have very interesting nor very good acting skills. This goes for the character Niko especially. His acting wasn't very good and could detach you at times, actually I felt a bit like that with other characters as well.

Maybe I disliked it more than I should have, but looking at it as a movie in general, it was stupid and very cliche. And where the hell did the lighting crew go?
