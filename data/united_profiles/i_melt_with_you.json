It's been two weeks since i watched it on Netflix, and I still can not stop thinking about it.  I thought it was a beautiful, albeit intense movie.  The score is just as enchanting and the acting is phenomenal!  The subject matter is dark, and the director,  Mark Pellington, takes the audience places most filmmakers dare not go.  It doesn't help that it has 3 relatively mainstream actors, two of which are well known for doing comedy, which i feel is what shot this film in the foot.  Movie-goers expectations.  I feel the people who choose to watch based solely on the cast, and know nothing of the movie are setting themselves up for disappointment.
