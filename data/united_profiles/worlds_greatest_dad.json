This is not the best film to watch if you want to see it for him right now, but all the same, I enjoyed it a good bit. The comedy works for the most part and at times, it gut bustingly hilarious. However, there are definitely a lot of long portions of this one that are not all that funny. This one is certainly very dark at times, but the humor of the situations lighten it up a tad. The film is also an interesting discussion of posthumous celebrity, suicide, and teenagers. However, the film itself is pretty predictable. As you watch it, you can pretty much assume how it will end, but that is not a huge deal to me, though it does hurt the overall enjoyment since I knew what was ultimately going to happen. All the same, this one is a dark, enjoyable, at times upsetting little film that is a good one to watch if you are looking for something to watch.",

His feelings of loneliness and guilt were a sacrifice he should have made to keep the lie going and to keep helping kids with depression problems. It's like he had a cure to many suicides and then took it away. I discussed this with some people after watching the film and they all thought he did the right thing, that the truth is what matters. But i thought to myself 'is the truth really important if the lie is helping people and saving lives?' The truth was important to Lance, it freed him of his guilt, but at the same time it ended the feelings of confidence and companionship people felt after reading the book. While thinking about this i remembered a quote someone said, i can't remember who it might have been off Batman: \"those who have the power to do good, have the responsibility to\" and so i think Lance's decision and the moral message were wrong.",

The odd cover art you might see for this will typically just show Williams, and with all of the family friendly cookie cutter movies he's made, his image along with the title is bound to make people think it's another one of those Disney type popcorn movies, and that might be what they are expecting when they see it. The intended audience (who might like darker and twisted comedies) might pass for the same reason, the title. It's meant to be darkly ironic of course, but I can just imagine what marketing discussions were like, they must have had no clue on how to \"sell\" this movie. I truly enjoyed it, and it got big deserving laughs several times. Williams is at his absolute best, and the script is full of highly amusing dialogue. The one area where Bobcat flails a bit in my opinion is in relying too heavily and too often on montages set to music. It's used very well in some scenes, and too much or too heavily in others. And when you have two humorous montage music segments within minutes of one another it really breaks up the flow of the story. That said, that is really the extent of my criticism as I think the movie succeeds very well on it's own terms. Some of the smaller scenes are wonderfully played, such as a scene where Williams visits his paranoid shut in neighbor and they share a plate of pot brownies. It's a shame more people will not see this movie, but then again it's the kind of comedy that makes people uncomfortable, like \"King of Comedy.\" A lot of people won't enjoy being messed with in such a genuinely edgy way, but the right people will love it. You don't see movies with guts like this one has very often.",

The suicide note he forged gets printed by the school newspaper, making his loser son, an overnight sensation. Williams is a great actor and gives creedence to even a bad film like this, but even he can't save this one. The story is just ridiculous, his son (Daryl Sabara) was a complete  that everyone wanted dead. No one would all of a sudden care, just because he wrote a heartfelt suicide note. It's also extremely unrealistic, since his son was as stupid as they come. That being said, with the exception of newcomer, Eric Martin, the rest of the supporting cast was awful, making the film that much more unrealistic. World's Greatest Dad may have landed it's star, but it's a sloppy movie, that really doesn't make a whole lot of sense. It's an hour and a half of pure torture, with the occasional funny scene that's all Robin Williams.
