Overall, I would say this film has many strengths, but none that make it a truly great film. As it stands, it is pretty good, but is missing that \"it\" factor. Its main negative is that it is a touch too long, even though it is two hours. Some scenes could have been cut and the final result would have been just as effective.

The film echoes a sense of dread and anxiety, channeling Shannon's dark, slightly unhinged, sullen aura, his trademark loomy stature and coarse features; he brings to life a \"Curtis\" character who is so malleable in his purpose, that no one can tell what's to happen next. Moreover, it feels as if what the audience is seeing has much more depth, as if another layer of subtext is just waiting to show itself. Nichols paints a portrait that is both astounding and riveting to hold on to, grimmacing and shuddering uneasily with anticipation and pent-up apprehension, driven by self-discovery, and down-right frightening in the most eerie of feelings. Although it is Shannon that reels in arguably the best performance of his career, more than worthy of an Oscar nomination, Chastain is incidentally moving, though mostly captured in her spot-lighted contemplation and worry. Notwithstanding near impeccable casting, editing, musical accompaniment, and cinematography, not all will appreciate \"Take Shelter\" due to its slothlike pace, frustratingly ambiguous, conflicting religious and metaphysical themes and interpretations, and its crazed, schizophrenic sequences.

Not since \"There Will Be Blood\" was there that much intensity in a scene and it was invigorating to see it on-screen.

He takes drastic action to protect his family, so drastic that it threatens to rip his life apart. His wife thinks he's going crazy, even he thinks he might be going crazy. But he still continues on because he truly believes in what he's doing. I found this conflict fascinating, and the question that writer/director Jeff Nichols leaves us with is equally compelling. Is Curtis a paranoid schizophrenic or is he a prophet? The ending doesn't give you the answers you're looking for. This isn't the kind of film that's wrapped up in a nice tiny ribbon. It forces you to think. The performances are also terrific here. Michael Shannon really allows us to see the conflict brewing in Curtis. We can connect with his doubts as he makes decisions a sane person probably wouldn't make. Overall, this movie isn't for everybody. It's definitely an independent film in the sense that the pace is slow and the movie ends ambiguously, but for those of you looking for a film that will stick with you for days, be sure to check this one out.",

In a theater of 20 people on a cold Sunday night, 10 people, including me, walked out within the first hour.  The entire first hour consisted of no plot development.  Every 10 minutes this guy was having nightmares, and the only purpose of these dreams was apparently to scare the sh*t out of the audience.  By the third nightmare, I was over it.  Based on the spoilers I've read, apparently this crap just continues the entire length of the movie.  It's a 15 minute plot spread out for what feels like an eternity.  Clearly there must be someone in this movie --- either an actor, or someone behind the scenes --- who has a cult following, as it would be the only explanation as to why it has such high ratings on here.  It was one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life.  If you want to see great acting and \"cinematography\", or whatever the hell else people are saying is so great about this movie, you'd be better off seeing a movie whose writing didn't suck.
