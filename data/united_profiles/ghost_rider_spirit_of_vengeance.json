From now on, whenever you hear the words GHOST RIDER, the first thing that comes to your mind it will be a veryy baddd movie! They definitely do not have enough good basic material to build a reasonable movie in the first place, thiz is for the second time! The first GHOST RIDER in 2007 was one of the ugliest superhero movies ever made. Anyway, I have my respect for the Directors Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor. Generally, I like their works especially the stylish camera angle and color structure. A little bit rough, energetic and sometimes comical, with fast moving scenes exactly like they had shown in CRANK (2006) and GAMER (2009). But that is certainly not enough. Thiz time, Johnny Blaze (Nicolas Cage), the alter-ego of Ghost Rider has to protect a child from the devil in human form upon the demand of a monk named Moreau (Idris Elba). The storyline is obviously weak in all aspects. They tell a simple story in long and boring 90+ minutes. Furthermore, the setting is told in Europe. Hello... where is the Europe? I do not see Europe! All I see is desert and rocky mountains in the middle of nowhere. After all, the Ghost Rider character is originally dark and mysterious. That atmosphere is clearly not shown here. They are using too much sick humor and too much clear blue sky, if you know what I mean. It crossed my mind, it could be totally different if they hire the Director who knows how to make a convincing shade of dark gothic like Tim Burton or Guillermo del Toro. The next thing is Nicolas Cage. I do not know what really happened to Cage, he is obviously trying to look cool with his cheesy one-liner dialogue. Moreover, in some scenes when Blaze struggled to hold back the devil inside him to come out, he creates a very strange and amusing expression. The rest of the Casts delivering B-Class performance such as: Idris Elba, Violante Placido, Johnny Whitworth, Christopher Lambert, even the child Fergus Riordan. the Devil once said to Johnny Blaze, You were the worst fricking deal I ever made. well, I have my complaint too, I just want my money back!",

The ending, I dont even consider it a spoiler since its so predictable, hell, even the final battle was boring as hell. This is the epic ending (I don't consider it spoilers since its this simple but if you think it does, don't read beyond this:    \"Did we do it?\" \"Hell Yes\". Ghost Rider rides. The end.",

      "text": "First, the good things.  GRSOV is better than its predecessor.  This wasn't a sequel, it was a reboot.  And with David Goyer writing, it was expected to be better.  Graphically, GR looked much better.  He was much more of a character in this film.  Nic Cage's Johnny Blaze was much better. I loved that they skimmed over the origin.  It was very well done.  The action sequences were also top notch.  However, the bad is a mix of what is bad about film-making in general and the unmet expectations of comic book lovers for Marvel Knight characters in general.  Ghost Rider is a pseudo interesting character to begin with.  In theory, he should make a bad-ass film protagonist.  In reality, he's great in action and graphically, but even Goyer's writing skills can't make him that interesting. Like the abysmal attempts at getting a good Punisher on film, the reality is, the Marvel Knights characters will never make interesting films as long as the focus is on the violent part of their characters rather than what makes them dark in the first place.  So, in the long line of poor attempts, GRSOV ranks higher than Punisher: War Zone, Dolph Lundgren's Punisher and the original GR, but that's about it. I truly hope there isn't a third.",

      "text": "I honestly don't even know where to begin. After the brief snippet of footage that was screened at Comic Con 2011, I had a tremendous amount of faith in GHOST RIDER: SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE. I'm a huge fan of the work that Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor did with the CRANK films, and I thought their unorthodox style would benefit the GHOST RIDER franchise and result in a sequel that far surpassed its predecessor. Yeah, not so much. This film is a colossal disaster from start to finish, featuring a script that seems unfinished, characters that are barely established, and one of the absolute worst performances in Nicolas Cage's career. After a stylish animation sequence that establishes the character's origin, we find Johnny Blaze living in the Balkans for reasons that are never quite explained (this will become a recurring theme for nearly every major plot point in the film). An alcoholic priest named Moreau (Idris Elba with an inconsistent French accent) shows up on his doorstep and offers to lift the Ghost Rider curse in exchange for Blaze rescuing a young boy named Danny (Fergus Riordan) from the same demonic entity that purchased Blaze's soul, an entity that is now called Roarke rather than Mephistopheles and is now played by Ciarin Hinds rather than Peter Fonda. Blaze jumps on his bike and takes off, showing up just as our incredibly boring and non-threatening bad guy Carrigan (Johnny Whitworth) catches up with Danny and his Gypsy mother (Violante Placido). The Ghost Rider emerges and begins to lay waste to Carrigan's henchmen, turning them into piles of ash and terrifying the bejesus out of everyone - except Carrigan, who takes him out with a grenade launcher and disappears with the kid. The rest of the film is essentially one drawn-out chase sequence, punctuated by conveniently placed dialogue scenes where our characters try (and fail) to explain exactly what the hell is going on, amounting to nothing more than speed bumps on the road to Blaze's next transformation into his flaming skeletal alter-ego. To level the playing field, Roarke grants Carrigan some demonic powers of his own, leaving him with pale skin, a bad hair-metal wig, and the EXACT SAME ABILITIES as the first film's (far more interesting) villain, resulting in confrontations that feel boring, recycle, and unimaginative - because they are. Cage's manic, frenzied portrayal of Blaze feels nothing like the character he created in the first film, resulting in plenty of absurd, laughable moments as he shifts the insanity into overdrive, particularly in an interrogation scene where the Ghost Rider is \"scraping at the DOOOOOOOR\"and Blaze is trying desperately to hold him back. This performance is certainly the highlight of the film - unfortunately, it's for all the wrong reasons. While the new design of the Ghost Rider looks fantastic, featuring a charred skull and a leather jacket that bubbles and melts from the heat, the character feels like something from a cartoon, head tilted quizzically to one side as he contemplates his victims or giggling to himself as he turns a piece of construction equipment into a flaming instrument of death. Oh, and he pisses fire, of course. I'll give Neveldine and Taylor all the credit in the world for the adventurous and innovative method of filmmaking they developed on the CRANK films, but this style doesn't work here. GHOST RIDER: SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE is poorly written, poorly edited, and poorly acted, and accomplishes nothing except to showcase that Neveldine and Taylor obviously have no idea what makes the character work. Make no mistake, this is the BATMAN AND ROBIN of the GHOST RIDER franchise, and everyone involved in this mess should be ashamed of themselves. www.nerdrep.com",

From the lackluster action sequences where all Ghost Rider has to do to defeat his foes is swing his chains to Nicholas Cage's simply loony acting this movie truly offers nothing to us. I am a huge superhero movie fan and slightly enjoyed Ghost Rider 1. DONT EXPECT THEM TO MENTION ANYTHING ABOUT THE PREVIOUS MOVIE. Except for the fact it's Nicholas Cage, there is no connection. THis movie's story is a consistent set of plotholes so gaping and awkward that the extreme nerd on you is going to cry blood.  Nothing after the credits. The visuals in this movie would be GREAT for a grad student's portfolio reel but the times they selected to use the over-the-top imagery are ill-fitting. Maybe it's because ghost-rider himself is a crappy hero to have a movie about but if this movie was a kitten I would not pet it.",

A single viewing makes it obvious why Marvel Enterprises would move forward with the sequel to a feature whose box office performance was underwhelming.

Also, I know Nic Cage is in financial distress and has to film pretty much every screenplay with which he is presented, but doesn't the law of averages demand that somewhere along the way, if only by accident, he would stumble upon a good movie?",

The trailers made it look like an awesome, crazy, and over the top action movie with some hilarious moments, however the movie failed to deliver that. It seems to me like the people behind this movie couldn't decide what they wanted to do with this movie. It couldn't decide whether to be some super serious movie, or the zany over the top, humorous movie the trailers showed. When it's trying to be serious it ends up being super boring, and when it's trying to be over the top it's like the director didn't know how to make it happen so it falls flat, and because of this the action scenes are really boring. It's got some funny moments, some intentional most not, but that's mostly do Nicolas Cage's performance, although I think most of my laughs were at his poor performance rather than genuine humor in the script. Actually just about every performance in this was poor. There are so many things wrong with this movie that I couldn't fit them all into this review, but by far the worst flaw this movie has it that at times you can see hints of a great movie in there. You'll only see them for a second, but their there and that's what makes it so sad. Even sadder is that most of the movies hints of greatness are also in the trailer.",

I didnt read Ghost Rider too often, but I knew Blaze's origins and I knew they at least tried to get it as close as possible at the front of the first film. Of course, the first film had its issues, but they are small compared to the garbage that this brings to the table. This film is called Ghost Rider... but he is only in for about Fifteen minutes. Unlike the first film, the action scenes are slow, and have no tension to them once you see the Rider just standing there with a bad guy who he's grabbed by the collar for over a minute and a half while said bad guy's mates are standing there doing nothing but looking dumb. Another mistake I noticed was that not only did they make Ghost Rider get hurt by explosives, but they make him immune to them less than twenty minutes later in the best action scene in the film which is far too short to be satisfying. The pace of this film by the way is simply unbearable. The story is garbage, and the plot takes too long to go somewhere. We are stuck in a church for what feels like an eternity explaining origins of the Ghost Rider and how to rid one of the curse (which I wont spoil, so true fans can simply rent the film). The effects are a mixed bag. Some of the time they look cool, but at other times they just dont look right at all. And there are some things I dont like that they were unable to do due to the STUPID budget constraints put on the film (you cant make this with fifty mil, its that simple). Things like Blazes bike not transforming when he becomes the rider anymore, or how when he takes over other mechanical objects like a truck, the only thing that changes is that they light on fire. Whatever, in the end the movie just feels really unfinished, and I know the minds behind Crank 1 and 2 are capable of much better things. The best part for me was in the middle of the film when Ghost Rider just lays destruction upon everything he sees with a giant piece of construction equippment. I at least got that out of it.",

CRANK directors Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylorn attempt to inject the same high-energy aesthetic in to the GHOST RIDER reboot, with disastrous results. SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE comes off looking like an unscripted mess, almost as if it were shot as an amateur music video for some no-name rock group. Nicolas Cage is as awful as ever. Why even bother rebooting the series only to bring back the single worst element from the original film? SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE takes a darker approach to the material that falls more closely in line with the comics, sacrificing the kid-friendly attitude from before in lieu of the increased action and horror. Ghost Rider has received a major overhaul as well, his charred skull and blistering costume being the only welcomed changes to the character. When standing before his enemies or blazing down the highway on his hellish motorcycle, he is an awesome sight to see. The remaining effects are uneven at best, and take a dive during the ugly transformation sequences. With a pointless excuse for a plot is hard to ignore, GHOST RIDER: SPIRIT OF VENGEANCE offers little more than the occasional eye-candy.",

Although, the plot needed more focus, same with character development. However, the Ghost Rider himself was the star of the film! He's mean, crazy, and funny in a way. Should make another one, but as a reboot, 'cause Nicholas Cage could do better than this.",

I don't follow the comics, and I have a general dislike of Cage's acting, but I actually found him tolerable in this movie(the only other movie he's marginally ok in my eyes being \"Face Off\"). It's not a life changing, mold-breaking piece of cinema by any means, but it's still good fun. I had my doubts after the catastrophe the first movie was, but I'm glad I used my afternoon to give this version a go. Who knew insane flaming skeletons in a leather jacket could be so hot?",

No exaggeration, no hyperbole, this is literally the worst thing my eyes have ever been forced to watch in all its unholy non-glory. The writing is so unbelievably terrible, and the \"acting\" is even worse. First of all, Nic Cage is at his finest - and by finest, I mean he takes things way the hell over the top. Not emotionally, no, that would actually be kind of cool; he goes his usual over the top weirdness. To make matters worse, even when Cage is nowhere to be seen and it's the (surprisingly awesome) CGI, it gets even stranger and yet far, far lamer somehow. The highlights of Ghost Rider's evil-fighting spree include pissing fire and instead of giving people the penance stare he, I kid you not, just sort of picks them up by the throat and waggles his head back and forth in front of them for several seconds at a time. No pain, no soul-burning, no evil-slaying, he just kind of stares at them like he's trying to seduce them with his flaming eye sockets.",
