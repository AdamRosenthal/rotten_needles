The surprise is the understanding that is revealed in the last few minutes of the film that one is continually wondering about through the entire picture.  Max Von Sydow gives a lesson in performance that mirrors the performance of Falconetti in the great silent film about the trial of Joan of Arc.  Sydow's silent performance is etched in every line and crevice of his face and with each diverted glance of his eyes.  He is perfect.  Sandra Bullock acquits herself brilliantly.  She is as troubled as her son and when the time comes is as revealing as Max Von Sydow's face.  Viola Davis once again turns in a superb performance along with Jeffrey Wright.  Daldry uses New York City as his landscape and paints the details resoundingly.  And yes the pivotal piece of the film is 9/11 but only that 9/11 was the catalyst to the story that evolves and not the story itself.  Critics and Bloggers made this piece more about 9/11 than it really was and managed to kill the audience for the piece.",

But when I heard about the new ruling for the Best Picture race, I thought they were supposed to pick 5 instead of the 10 films (the same 5's they always put in every year during the nominations announced). I wasn't really sure if they're doing the right thing, but It feels unsatisfied and distasteful if you want to know who the winner is during award season. So, shame on you, Oscars. I thought The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo should've replaced Incredibly Close to get a Best Picture nod. That film is so entertaining, I should start reading the book again.

      "text": "Having seen the 49% critical rating on Rottentomatoes.com concerned me since the trailers for this film had me anxiously awaiting its release. I never read those reviews until after I see the film.  Then, if I disagree, I go back and read what insight other critics had in the film that I didn't see.  9 times out of 10, it is because the critic doesn't like the translation of the written material from book to screenplay.  That appears to be the case with \"Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close.\"  I haven't read the book, so aside from some small \"Hollywoodisms,\" I can't see how anyone could hate this movie.  Thomas Horn's portrayal of Oskar is touching, heartwrenching, precious and incredibly real.  I cringed a couple of times where it was clear that the story was being manipulated and, as a person who is known to cry at these kinds of things, I didn't.  I was moved by how \"father-and-son\" the story was.  However, I wish I had received more than a \"meh\" from my 16 year-old who saw it with me.  9/11 is such a risky theme around which one would base a story, but, aside from the recon adventures and Asperger element of Oskar's character, I can imagine that the emotion and the time it took to let sink in the inexplicable and sudden horror that happened on that day had on families, especially children, of the victims as very close to reality.  The setting of New York City is a character in and of itself in the movie.  As a lover of NYC, i strongly connected with every stop in his tour of the boroughs, seeking the answers he thought his father wanted him to find.   Overall, \"Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close\" is worth the time and engagement, if for Thomas' performance alone.  Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock are perfect to support Thomas without smothering his wonderful work.  And while it's hard to imagine Max von Sydow as anyone but Ming the Merciless in \"Flash,\" his script-less role is stronger than most in other movies with 2 full hours of dialogue.  The movie is precious from beginning to end.",

The boy finds a key that his dad had left behind, so he feels the need to find what the key is for, because he believes that is has some use for him (from his father). The majority of the film takes us on this journey, following the  boy's search for what the key is for all over NYC. The movie is very emotional. It deals with a mother and a son's rocky relationship, healing after a close one's death, and it reminds you of the chaos the families and the city of New York had to deal with. It definitely hit me and made me think very deeply about 9/11 and what the families had gone through. I thought this movie portrayed this well and it turned out beautifully. The movie really dives in the boy's mind, and I believe that Thomas Horn, who had  only had television experience once before the film on Jeopardy, did  a fantastic first-time acting job.

      "text": "This is my least favorite movie of all time, no question. Let's get this out of the way: the 9/11 subplot of this movie is a cash grab. The movie's main plot would've been exactly the same if all 9/11 elements were wiped out of it, minus the fact that it probably wouldn't have been a tearjerker (it wasn't one for me, but I can imagine it was for many other viewers). Now that that's said and done, I was looking forward to Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close because it was the second film adaptation of author Jonathan Safran Foer's work, which I usually love. Also, with a cast that included Hanks, Bullock, Sydow, and Goodman, I was practically sold. Not to mention the Best Picture nomination almost ensured that I was going to like this movie. The supporting actors were good, but all of their performances were smothered and subverted by Horn's annoying and almost unwatchable performance. If the character was written as a bratty kid then Horn may just be the greatest actor in the world. Even if that is the case, an unenjoyable lead character usually leads to an unenjoyable movie. That is the case with this one. I'll give it this: the oxymoron part was pretty cool, even if it only took up about a minute of this overly long film. And, oh god, the tambourine.",

      "text": "It's easy to dismiss a film based on poor reviews and bad press. Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close might be painful and frustrating to watch, but it is not a bad film. In fact, ELIC is a very good film. Panned for its sentimentality, panned for its apolitical stance on 911, panned for the perception that the film was poorly acted - the majority of professional film critics found one fault or another for this film. Frankly, both critics and audiences palates have been dulled by an onslaught of recent films with bold bright primary colors with little complexity, paced so frenetically that one might think that directors don't want to give their audiences a chance to stop and think how insipid the story is. ELIC, however, builds slowly and curiously, like taking a walk in a strange park for the first time. To complicate matters, we must take that walk with a protagonist that we are not meant to like and cannot grow to love. But, along the way we meet those around this unusual boy who we do care about, and if we watch carefully, begin to see the boy as they see him.",
