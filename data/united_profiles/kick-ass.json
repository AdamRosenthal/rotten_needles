      "text": "Kick-Ass is without question the best of the recent trend of postmodern superhero films. It's not mercilessly bleak like Watchmen, not depraved like Super and it's certainly not for kids like Sky High. A lot of the film's quality hinges on a truly great cast. Aaron Johnson makes a great loveable loser Dave Lizewski who decides to become the titular, wet-suited hero, Mark Strong adds another great despicable villain, the powerful gangster Frank D'Amico to his repertoire and Christopher Mintz-Plasse is great as always playing Frank's lonely son and (disturbingly willing) heir to the D'Amico criminal empire, who masquerades as a new hero Red Mist to contact Kick-Ass under the pretence of friendship. The real highlights of the film are the dream pairing of a moustachioed Nicholas Cage doing his best Adam West impression and a hilariously filthy-mouthed Chloe Grace Moretz playing the vengeful father/daughter hero team of Big Daddy and Hit Girl. Let's be honest, Mr Cage has had some stinkers in his career, but when he gets it right, he really gets it right - he has the opportunity to show his undeniable talent for both comedy and pathos here, and the character arc of Damon and Mindy Macready is certainly the most rewarding and entertaining of the whole film. There are a few instances where the story runs out of steam, and Matthew Vaughn's Brit-dominated cast of villains do occasionally slip out of their American tough-guy accents, but a wealth of affectionate digs at comic book lore, Jane Goldman's delightfully sweary script, some gloriously violent action and Matthew Vaughn's accomplished direction more than make up for it. Kick-Ass is an immensely enjoyable viewing experience, that will please comic fans, comedy fans and fans of terrifying murderous tweens alike. I just hope the inevitable sequel doesn't lose any of its charm, inventiveness and especially its sense of fun.",

Ultimately I think the ones crying \"for shame!\" are over-reacting  just a tad. The film does puts its toes to the line, but for me it doesn't quite cross it. And let's face it, it's a funny, clever idea, extremely well executed. It doesn't make the mistake of many such films by diving into the action immediately before we've gotten to know the characters. People are oblivious to the fact that it makes it more exciting if we care about what happens to them, if it's not just frenetic mindless action. Vaughn takes his time and his pacing is impeccable, just the right amount of build-up to the climactic scenes, and he deftly makes these scenes emotional as well as exciting. The cast is pretty much great, with the possible exception of Mark Strong, who is not quite loathesome enough to be the arch-villain. Every critic and every \"user\", however, has agreed on one thing: this film contains a star in the making. Chloe Grace Moretz is astoundingly assured and inspired at 11 years old. Never seen a child actor this compelling EVER, not Anna Paquin, not Natalie Portman, not Jodie Foster. She steals every scene she's in and steals the movie. See it just for her.  Also, great music.",

Rather, it unmasks an adult world in which police officers operate on both sides of crime, citizens are voyeurs into one another's suffering, and we all wonder who is going to change it.  By now, it is clear that neither adults nor teenagers are willing to risk their routines for their neighbors.  At least teenagers still fantasize about doing something.  So the obvious answer is a little girl who, with some sidekick mockery from Nic Cage, makes Batman look like a man dressed up like a bat.  To echo other reviewers, Hitgirl is the new standard of awesome.  But, until Kick-Ass' moment of transformation, she is also the last human willing to offer an embodied answer to injustice.  That Vaughn hides this seriousness in such absolutely brilliant awesomeness might confuse some, but it should not be misinterpreted as a statement of \"coolness\" or teenage hormonal self-gratification.  It's saying much more than that.  Why hold the fact that it's also cool against it?",

The title character is played Aaron Johnson, who justifies his place on the screen. I thought his American accent (he's British) was very natural and he brings this 'loser' character to life. But don't think he's the star, it's actually his smaller companion played by Chloe Grace Moretz - the merciless and skilled fighter Hit Girl. She was effective, outstanding and gives one of the best performances by a child actor that I've seen in a while. She'll be remembered for quite some time. Other standouts performances include Nicolas Cage's performance as Hit Girl's father Big Daddy who was reminiscent of Adam West's Batman and Mark Strong's drug lord mobster Frank D'Amico actually was pretty funny. Matthew Vaughn's third film is nothing short of a miracle because some superhero movies are pretty awful now, I definitely think this will be a cult film from now on.",

      "text": "Kick-Ass is one of those films where either you like it or not. This movie really divides people. The movie got a lot of buzz around its release because an 11 year old girl cusses rather graphically and performs gratuitous violence in the movie.  Kick-Ass is a critic's wet dream it's the kind of movie you can bash or praise. Sadly I fall in the category of only liking it halfway so I will give it a mixed review and a mixed rating. The movie has at least three plots, the first consisting of Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson) a normal high school kid who likes to read comic books with his friends. One day he thinks to himself why a real person doesn't stands up and becomes a real superhero. He goes and buys a suit from eBay and decides to fight crime. The next one is involving Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong) a ruthless, psychotic gangster who son who is played by Christopher Mintz-Plasse, who blames Kick-Ass for stealing his drugs and killing his men. The last one which caused the buzz, is of Hit Girl played by Chloe Grace Moretz and her father Big Daddy played by Nicolas Cage. That's when the movie hits a down low. Hit Girl is an 11 year old girl who's been brain washed by her father to kill as much bad guys as possible. She cusses like an adult and has very cool ways to kill people.  This movie made a mistake that it should have made clear. Hit Girl's innocence as a little kid. It ignores it completely and just makes her an engine of violence. There is a scene where her birthday comes and she asks for a puppy and Big Daddy looks at her weird. She says she's joking and wants a butterfly knife. Instead of a birthday cake or decorations it's talk about weapons and killing people. No matter how ruthless or mean a young child is that kid still has innocence. The kid can cry and be happy ask for nice things. Kick-Ass ignores that and in the process offends people. There's an emotional scene in the movie that I could not enjoy because of all the ruthless violence. The movie exploits her innocence just to make more scenes of violence and action. I might be exaggerating but I wonder why the hell MPAA didn't give it NC-17 rating. (SPOLIER) Here's something to think about this girl gets brutally beaten by a grown man. I'm a father and don't think I'm crazy I imagined my daughter in that situation.  You're probably saying but just don't think it's your daughter. How I'm I suppose to do that when in this world there's enough sickos who actually like doing that to 11 year old girls. Here's food for your mind how de we know as movie goers that a pedophile likes what happens to Hit Girl in the movie. She's wearing a purple wing with a purple clothes to top all of she has a purple skirt. How do we know if a sick f@#k is sitting in the audience saying yeah that's what she gets? The worst part of it all it's a damn shame this movie fell to that because there all a lot of things that I was entertained with. I laughed at the jokes and liked Dave Lizewskie/Kick-Ass side of his story about wanting to help people. The movie was going to get three stars from me but I can't shake the feeling of seeing (SPOLIER) Red Mist shoot Hit Girl several times in the chest with no remorse, an 11 YEAR OLD GIRL. That's just my opinion though.  The movie had potential but fails. My favorite critic Roger Ebert called it morally reprehensible. I find it morally reprehensible half way. Maybe I'll rent the DVD and see it again, it might change my opinion.  NOTE: Quentin Tarantino use anime to express pedophilia in telling the story of O-Ren Ishii in Kill Bill Volume1 why couldn't director Matthew Vaughn did that for Hit Girl's action scenes.",

      "text": "Aptly titled Kick-Ass is an excellent comic book adaptation that proves that there is no stagnation in a superhero genre whatsoever. Based on Mark Millar's violent tale Kick-Ass is directed by Matthew Vaughn, the filmmaker who happens to have a real knack for both action movies (Layer Cake) and teen fantasies (Stardust). It's more than evident in Kick-Ass and although the film has some problems with selecting the proper tone: it verges between campy comedy, dramatic piece and action spectacle, this is a gripping ride from start to finish.Vaughn's direction is nothing less than clever and kinetic. By employing video game techniques inspired by Shoot 'Em Up and Crank movies, Vaughn really excels at showing highly-stylized bloody violence on screen. As for the script, the main concept of an ordinary teenager who chooses to become a superhero is downright effective evoking loads of laughs and our sympathy. Aaron Johnson's cool, unrestrained performance also helps a great deal.The film revitalizes the genre by undermining its rules. The characters involved have no special powers, most of them, no necessary backstory and no turning point that resulted in them becoming superheroes, much like in Watchmen. Despite this, the movie establishes its own pantheon of heroes and the director knows that there's nothing more fascinating than the battle between good and evil shown in a vivid, exciting fashion.What's controversial about the film is the extensive use of pitch-black humor including the character of 11-year-old Mindy McReady aka Hit-Girl who has been trained from the early years to become a killing machine by her loving father aka Big Daddy. The whole subplot may be immoral for some who don't understand this kind of cinema, yet it's surprisingly plausible due to a tongue-in-cheek writing and acting talents of Chloe Moretz and Nicolas Cage who are as subversive in their respective parts as you can get. Last but not least, the artist formerly known as McLovin' channels a wannabe villain named Red Mist. You may be actually surprised by how smart he is in his plotting.Overall, Kick-Ass is a refreshingly funny and wickedly entertaining spectacle that warrants the whole franchise of masked teenagers to come. 9/10 (A-)",

Thiz movie was very confident since the beginning, they advertise it rapidly and the posters were very intriguing too. It is about Dave (Aaron Johnson), unpopular and nerdy boy at school who wants to be a superhero even without super power. He tried to save the world with alter-ego named kick-ass, on the contrary he got his ass kicked. Meanwhile, Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage) and her eleven-year-old daughter named Hit-Girl (Chlo\u00c3\u00ab Grace Moretz) who has been the real superheroes were fighting the crime againts drug dealer mob, Frank D Amico (Mark strong). Frank attempted to put his son, Chris (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) as undercover superhero named Red Mist, his intentions was to trap Kick-Ass. Mark Strong once again succesfully brought an interesting villain character. Recently, He had been bad guy for ROCKNROLLA (2008), THE YOUNG VICTORIA (2009), SHERLOCK HOLMES (2009), ROBIN HOOD (2010) and upcoming GREEN LANTERN (2011) and previously many more. He could deliver different bad guy characters with his aura and I admired him for that. I officially gave him Bad Guy of The Year award (if I could). Other casts, Johnson was standard and Cage performance was just what we needed. It is Chlo\u00c3\u00ab Grace Moretz who surprised us with believeable and easy-going performance. Outside of her Hit-Girl fight scene which was awesome (we knew probably substituted by stunt double) but she was also good in drama. The Director is Matthew Vaughn who directed STARDUST (2004) and respectable LAYER CAKE (2007). Actually on thiz movie, the conversation was rude (considered it as family movie) and the fight scene was bloody brutal, but we have to admit the story was original and effectively hilarious. The movie was brave enough to challenge the mainstream and it worked well in some moments. In my point of view, when we dare enough to laugh on ourself for our own stupidity or feebleness, that is the time we showed the big heart of us.",

      "text": "Being based on the comic book of the same name, the movie \"Kick-Ass\" respects the traditions of the comic book superhero genre by consciously getting inspiration from Spiderman and Batman. However, it transcends simple imitation by far. The production of the movie is awesome. Above all mentionable is the film's magnificent use of music. First off, in terms of the script, the movie does a wonderful job in criticizing the perceived lack of responsibility to people passing and watching a crime happen without doing anything against it. If many people start helping in bad situations that are not too dangerous, and if children are already being raised to intervene, everyone could contribute to a more secure society. This would also lessen the chance of getting mugged at some point in your life. On the other hand morally controversial, is the glorification of the revenge murdering committed by two of the protagonists who are less than more on the side of the righteous heroes. Even a woman that was not a threat but tried to flee was stabbed to death. Revenge killing is not a necessary evil for a good cause (as would be a killing in self defense). Therefore, they are hardly any different than some villain who kills for power. Rather than portraying the revenge in a neutral way or actually suggesting that revenge is morally bad, the cinematic glorification of it makes the movie less likable. Nevertheless, \"Kick-Ass\" is totally worth watching.",

Kick-Ass is part hard-core action flick, part parody, and part comedy. Done poorly, this sort of thing can be painful. Done well, as is the case here, it's a blast. It offers a \"have your cake and eat it, too\" experience - you can enjoy the exploits of a superhero while at the same time showing your hipness by laughing at some of the sillier clich\u00e9s.

Just can't see how some people would hate it. Well, I guess if you took your child to this movie thinking it will be for kids, but who would think of that with the title Kick-Ass. What Im really surprised about is how Nicholas cage did in this movie, playing Big Daddy. It wasn't one of his same old acting, but it was something most of us was waiting for. Of course, Hit Girl, played by Cloe Moretz, was my favorite character. She did the most awesome moves when fighting. Aaron Johnson might have been a new face to all of you, if you haven't seen Nowhere Boy, which you have to see. Aaron played the main character, Kick-Ass, who's got sick and tired of getting picked on. So he becomes a superhero, and becomes really famous. Then somehow everything turns out wrong, when a part of gang gets taken down by kick-Ass, Hit girl, and Big Daddy. The last two action scenes is so awesome and intense that I almost peed myself. Kick-Ass and Red Mist are probably the ones that make this movie have hilarious parts. I also discovered that this had songs from Danny Boyle's \"28 days later\" and \"Sunshine\" during the fight scenes that really made it's mark. I will definitely love this film, and the characters, and I think I just found a new favorite director, Mathew Vahn, who directed \"Stardust\" ( who would've guessed that), and produced \"Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\".

An outstanding aspect of the film is the casting, in particular bringing all of our attention to Chlo\u00c3\u00ab Moretz in the controversial role of Hit Girl. Others performed admirably too; Cage turned in a decent performance; Aaron Johnson played the eponymous role well; and comedy was provided from all angles in the form of Dave Lizewski's buddies, Marty and Todd. The real brilliance of the film though is routed in the realistic nature of the setting and characters, with the plot showing fantastic uniqueness. Kick-Ass has succeeded in being a great film, good fun to watch and yet at the same time making the audience feel emotionally invested in the characters. The action sequences are worth a special mention, in particular those involving the character Hit Girl, because of the way in which they are shot. Matthew Vaughn has pulled out all the stops in creating visually stunning fight sequences, and coupled with a well chosen soundtrack, he has created some of the best action sequences in recent times. None of this compromises the emotional integrity of the film, and for that the film creators deserve great credit given how gory the comic was. A great film, a kick-ass film.",

Aaron Taylor-Johnson is also solid in the lead role and does a fine job, though Moretz certainly hints at her future potential as a great actress in this role. Fun, well paced, and actually quite well written, Kick-Ass may be a little skin deep and may indulge in gratuitous violence and silly, over-the-top moments a little too often, but it is hard to resist its charms. Plus, who does not appreciate a film with Nicolas Cage that can actually be labelled as \"good\"? Overall, Kick-Ass is just as silly and dumb as you may think, but it works thanks to stylish direction from Matthew Vaughn and a unique approach to the superhero genre.",

The title character is just there for laughs and to get his ass handed to him on more than one occasion. The movie shines because of Hit-Girl and her daddy Big Daddy, who violently kill criminals to keep them off the streets. But BD has a secret vendetta that he pursues ruthlessly. I liked the movie only because it showed a different version of the superhero concept, and that was refreshing. Just watch the movie by turning a blind eye to the blood and gore, if you can. The cutting of body parts and killings are presented in a humorous way yet very graphic, so be advised.",
