      "text": "This is probably the film I'm most disappointed with, despite the fact that it was ok. So, Ewan McGregor stars as a graphic designer. Sporadically set in flashbacks ranging from 1955-2007, McGregor discovers that his father, a 75 year old, is gay. His mother already died from cancer, and McGregor finds out his father will soon die too. Along this emotional rollercoaster, McGregor meets a French actress who rarely speaks, played by Melanie Laurent.  Their relationship blossoms after the death of his father, and he discovers her fragile past as well. So, a few things worked with others, so let's start with the positives. Most of the acting (see next paragraph for exception) was fantastic in this film, especially from Christopher Plummer, who played the father. His performance deserves some Academy recognition, even if it's just a nominee. I also was a fan of how this film dealt with its numerous dark topics. From cancer to abuse, the film covers so many topics in an 104 minute film, and glosses over them so easily.",

Classic Woody Allen films come to mind when attempting to describe this gem (partially due to the prevalent old-school jazz soundtrack), although Beginners lacks the overt neurosis (which may be a positive depending on one's opinion). It grabs your heart and mind and refuses to let go, proving that Beginners will be a film that I continue to think about and admire for a long, long time.

It isn't.  It is mostly about Ewan McGregor and the new woman in his life that he meets after his father dies, and how he has never been able to commit to a relationship once he gets serious with a woman.  The filmmaker seems to suggest he can't commit due to the fact that his mother and father were not close when he was growing up.  PLEASE.  Of course, the new woman he meets has commitment issues herself.  You feel like slapping these people and saying GROW UP already and enjoy each other.  Why all the unnecessary drama?  Also, I absolutely HATE graffiti, and these people spray graffiti all over the city with glee.  DISGUSTING.  Even the beginning of the film made me cringe when he is pouring a bunch of pills and medicine in a toilet which is not the proper way to dispose of medications (it pollutes).  The scenes between McGregor and his father (played wonderfully by Christopher Plummer) worked GREAT.  I wish the whole film was about those two.  I'm a big Woody Allen fan and I was hoping this would be similar to his films but it seriously lacked the drama and humor and great dialogue of a Woody Allen film.  Disappointing.",

      "text": "Beginners is a film about life, and the hugely contrasting ways you can view it. Are you gay or straight? An optimist or a pessimist? A romantic or realist? These questions are discussed with great insight and wit by writer/director Mike Mills, whose life the main events of the film are based. The cast are extremely strong - Ewan McGregor giving an understated, but ever engaging performance as Oliver, a graphic designer who has recently lost his father and steadily spirals into depression. Melanie Laurent also impresses as Anna, a jobbing actress who is terrified of a committed relationship with Oliver and the impact it could have on her career. Most of all though, Christopher Plummer absolutely captivates you in every scene he's in. He plays Hal, Oliver's father, who decides to come out as gay aged 75 on the tragic death of his wife Georgia (the brilliantly kooky Mary Page Keller). Plummer plays against type, which is refreshing, but not the main reason to savour his performance. What really blew me away about his performance was how well-developed, relateable and instantly believable he made Hal as a character, which is thankful because he is the driving force behind most of the events of the film - if Hal didn't emotionally resonate with us, then neither would the film as a whole. Shortly after his coming out, Hal is diagnosed with cancer, and must find the balance between receiving treatment and enjoying the liberation of his new life with young partner Andy (Goran Visnjik), and all the while Oliver worries and contemplates his lifelong inability to communicate with his father. The story is told very creatively, frequently jumping backwards and forwards, with Oliver's retrospective, thoughtful voiceover giving some insight into how he felt at the particular moment we are watching. The film is deeply personal, emotionally compelling and often very funny. I personally don't see the point in subtitling the Hal's dog Arthur's thoughts - it's an interesting idea, but adds very little to the film, appearing to be just quirky for the sake of it. I also found the finale a little underwhelming, with the rest of the film feeling so narratively tight and full of ideas, the final moments appear a little unfocused and somewhat emotionally soppy. These minor points aside, Beginners is without doubt one of the best films of 2011, with an outstanding performance from Plummer, great writing, and through being an immensely rewarding viewing experience in general.",

For me that was definitely  the case in Beginners. I know Mcgregor and Plummer get the publicity, but the character I enjoyed the most in this film was played by Laurent. I think the biggest problem for me is that there were too many threads in this movie to properly give us enough exposition to have a satisfying payoff. This movie was well acted, and the plot line between McGregor and Laurent did have a nice payoff. Past that, a bit of a jumbled mess for me.",

      "text": "I am a sucker for these kinds of movies that examine life, especially parental relationships and love. Beginners is no exception and remains endlessly touching and truly emotional, while somehow being relatable even though the situation of having a father come out of the closet at age 75 is certainly quite unique. It is not hard to believe that this was a personal situation for writer/director Mike Mills, evident in his graceful direction and fantastic script. The dialogue and characterizations feel thoroughly real and well-executed. Ewan McGregor, Melanie Laurent, and Christopher Plummer, all turn in very good performances here and real human beings with real emotions. It is always refreshing to see a film that treats the human condition with such respect and extracts drama from everyday life. Beginners is a perfect example of this and this, in turn, makes it a thoroughly enjoyable viewing experience. Overall, Beginners is a thoroughly sweet, endearing comedy-drama that really brings serious charm to the table.",
