Leonardo DiCaprio stars as the world's most famous G Man and Armie Hammer plays his faithful confidant and friend, Clyde Tolson while Naomi Watts portrays the role of Helen Gandy, J. Edgar's ever loyal secretary and girl Friday. The film was written by Dustin Lance Black and produced and directed by Clint Eastwood,. Although interesting from the point of view of the history of the nation's most famous crime fighting organization, I'm sorry to say that the film was much too long. Instead of shortening Hoover's name in the title of the film, the editors should have deleted a lot of unnecessary footage as the movie struggles to find itself and its proper pace.  In this case FBI could stand \"For Boring Individuals\". Even good things should end in a timely manner. This is not the Clint Eastwood we came to know in \"The Unforgiven\" or his other great films. It was almost as if pride of directorship and artistic endeavor overrode the necessity to make the film work in a tighter vehicle. Perhaps trying to cover such a complicated character over so long a period makes the extraordinary length of the film inevitable but not necessarily pleasant to watch. I give the film a score of 7,5 with the suggestion that a good cup of strong coffee prior to viewing it would be a good idea.,",

Leonardo DiCaprio is one of the finest young actors we have, and while his performances can tend to run together, he had an opportunity to shine even more in a role like this similarly to how he did as Howard Hughes in \"The Aviator.\"  The difference between \"The Aviator\" and \"J. Edgar\" is sitting behind the camera in this one.  Clint Eastwood, who has the biggest track record of empty, overrated directorial presentations, just blows it all to Hell in this one.  The directing is weak, bringing out the blandest performances with its horrid storytelling.  The movie shortchanges the viewer during what appear to be pivotal scenes, yet drags out the ones we knew were coming.  Pretty standard stuff from \"Bronco Billy.\"  The actors and viewers deserved better.  I hope the awful reviews send him a message.  I'm glad I only spent $1.25, although I deserve some change.",

As for the controversial makeup work, I have mixed feelings about it. The work on Naomi Watts (who also gave a good performance) was excellent, Di Caprio was inconsistent, and Hammer's makeup job was awful and stunted his performance.

The plot is very confusing as it will just switch between old and young Hoover and events interlap and stuff making the film kind of hard to follow at times. The acting and dialogue is a bit cheesy and stale and the film does nothing more than tell the events of Hoover's life from him at 24 years old to his death at 77 years old. The film does not offer any depth on Hoover, it would have been more interesting if the film went into detail about why Hoover did what he did but that does not happen. The film is largely uninteresting and can get very boring if you are not interested in J. Edgar Hoover. Overall, J. Edgar is an alright film that is not really worth the two hour time, not one of Leonardo DiCaprio's best films. I was kinda dissapointed by J. Edgar, not one of Clint Eastwood's best works either.

Eastwood's portrayal of one of the most influential people in American history is spot on and DiCaprio delivers an Oscar-worthy performance.  OK, it's not a Jason Statham movie, but it's not too slow.  Anyone who is familiar with or interested in the man behind the FBI should find this to be a fascinating movie.  I personally found the plot to be tight, the camera work to be well-done, and the history to be reasonably accurate.  As several others have noted, the make-up is so bad as to be distracting.  That is really the only downside.  This film is definitely worthy of renting.",

It's superbly acted by DiCaprio, well directed by Eastwood, and never has a dull moment.",

I\u00b4m not into biopics and these American powerful men don\u00b4t interest me at all, so I wasn\u00b4t expecting much. But when the film starts you can smell this Eastwood\u00b4s way of making great cinema. Cinematography is great and Leonardo Dicaprio makes you love and care for the character (despite being an obsessed man who did so many questionable things). The first hour is good... but to my surprise it got better after that when the character\u00b4s personal life finally comes to the front, like it should be in an Eastwood\u00b4s film. Judi Dench is always great, Naomi Watts is good and... another surprise is how good Armie Hammer is. Wasn\u00b4t expecting some of the scenes in the last part coming from a director like Eastwood. I give it a 9/10. An underrated film, with Dicaprio deserving of an oscar nomination which didn\u00b4t come (again) and a good way to know something about the US recent history",
