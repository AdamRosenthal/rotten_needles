I do not understand the critics and the atrocities that some alleged professionals are saying ... this movie is not intended as a masterpiece, and yet it is a good movie that fulfills exactly what it promises in the trailer. You can improve things of course (like all the things in this world), but  you will enjoy watching it and you will leave satisfied the cinema.",
