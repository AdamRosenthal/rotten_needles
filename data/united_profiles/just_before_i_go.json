He seemed to be branching out a little bit in goon in order to break away from the Stifler persona he has become known for, but it is this movie where he shows that he is a legitimate actor with something to offer. The rest of the cast is pretty good as well. Oliva Thirlby was good in this movie as well and was sadly underused despite being fairly likeable. I thought the movie was surprisingly funny as well. The downfalls of this film are its overreliance on quirkiness at the first and then breaking off into an unnecessary drama in the third act which loses the tone. Its sadly pretty clich\u00e9d for a film that seems to be embracing being offbeat.",
