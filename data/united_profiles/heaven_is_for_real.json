An example is when Colton goes to hospital - in the book, this was told in much more detail, and showed the gradual increase in Colton's sickness, right up to the point where Colton goes to hospital. In the movie however, the hospital scene seems to come out of no where and is rushed through extremely quickly, creating much less of an impact compared to if there was more of an emphasis here.",

      "text": "Not perfect, but definitely a step in the right direction.  There are some scenes towards the beginning that come across as generic and poorly written, but it soon rides out of that bumpy terrain and finds its footing.  It eventually becomes very engaging, moving, and occasionally beautiful.  The acting, screenplay, and cinematography are all leaps and bounds ahead of most movies in it's genre.  I think it might even change some people's opinions on the afterlife.  Sure, some aspects could have been improved upon, but it's far better than similar fare.",

The little boy Todd,  when he went to a funeral with his Dad,  wanted to know if the man who had died knew Jesus.  His father said I do not know, then Todd the little boy stated to his Dad,  he must know Jesus or he will not see heaven.  Holy Cow how was that missed in the movie.  The actors and acressess were very good in the movie and it was a movie that did not preach to you either, but to miss the central point of the book and not have it in the movie was disturbing.",

I had high hopes, but was utterly disappointed. Greg Kinnear was great in it, though.",
