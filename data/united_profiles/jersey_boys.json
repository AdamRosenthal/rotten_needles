Having said that I must report that it would be very tough to compare any movie to the actual Broadway show. Believe me I wanted to LOVE it. Unfortunately Director Clint Eastwood who I think the world of is absolutely clueless in directing this movie. Whereas the Broadway version captures the audience's attention in the first few minutes putting a smile on your face, the movie is dark, tedious, and very slow for the first hour or so. It just doesn't resonate with the viewer.. The second hour is somewhat better, but where the Broadway audience is taken on a joy ride, handing out standing ovations, while at the same time, crying with Frankie Valli on the death of his beloved daughter, this movie version just falls flat on its face.  There is little or no character development. The fabulous songs of the Four Seasons are treated more or less like window dressing, nothing more. To be perfectly honest, the best part of the movie is when its over, the credits are rolling, and the cast is singing and dancing in the street.  I would have loved to give Jersey Boys a perfect ten but it's impossible to do so. I recommend that when the touring company comes to your City, run don't walk, to see one of the best shows Broadway has ever produced. I'm sorry to say the movie does it no justice. Sorry.",

The reviewer, presumably a relative youngster, appears to have missed the fact that the material was deliberately presented in the hokey style of a 1940s/50s Hollywood biopic. Plot points in 'Jersey Boys' are not subtle, the gangsters are not Joe Pesci-style psychopaths, and the acting is definitely not Method. Some biopics  that possess the gritty qualities of real life \u2013 films about Johnny Cash, Lenny Bruce, Ray Charles, Jacqueline Dupre and Andy Kaufman come to mind -- are engrossing as a kind of cinema verite.  But equally engrossing are some of the hokiest bios of an earlier generation, including The Glenn Miller Story, The Five Pennies, The Eddy Duchin Story, The Pride of the Yankees and Lust for Life (Kirk Douglas as Vincent Van Gogh.)",

      "text": "Tratto da uno dei maggiori successi di Broadway nel decennio scorso, il nuovo film di Eastwood rappresenta la realizzazione del desiderio del regista di mettere la sua firma sotto a un musical, tanto da accettare di prendere il posto di Jon Favreau a progetto gi\u00e0 avviato. Si tratta di un'ulteriore tappa nella esplorazione dei generi classici hollywoodiani e il risultato \u00e8 una commedia musicale a tutto tondo (a testimoniarlo basterebbe la gioiosa scena collettiva sulla quale scorrono i titoli di coda) in cui i conflitti vengono smussati e anche il boss mafioso Gyp DeCarlo \u2013 nei cui panni gigioneggia divertito Cristopher Walken \u2013 \u00e8 rappresentato soltanto come un bonario, per quanto rispettato, \u2018facilitatore\u2019. La storia di Frankie Valli e dei futuri Four Seasons - Vivaldi chi? - inizia nel New Jersey con un vago sentore di \u2018American Graffiti\u2019 che pervade le peripezie di quattro ragazzi italoamericani alla ricerca del successo: in questa prima parte la scena \u00e8 dominata dal chitarrista e piccolo intrallazzatore Tony Visconti (Vincent Piazza) che spesso e volentieri parla direttamente in macchina \u2013 come pure succede pi\u00f9 avanti al bassista Nick Massi (Michael Lomenda), facendo nascere pi\u00f9 di un sospetto che si tratti di un omaggio a \u2018Quei bravi ragazzi\u2019 \u2013 e d\u00e0 l'avvio alla scalata organizzando le prime serate nei locali del circondario. A questo punto l'attenzione si sposta sul personaggio di Valli (John Lloyd Young), narrando la crescita verso il vertice della parabola e la susseguente discesa, che inizia proprio in uno dei momenti di massimo successo (l\u2019esibizione all\u2019Ed Sullivan Show), ma non si trasforma in un crollo rovinoso, anzi il cantante riuscir\u00e0 ancora a piazzare qualche buon colpo come solista, \u2018Grease\u2019 e \u2018Can't take my eyes off you\u2019 su tutti. Proprio la genesi di quest'ultimo brano si trova al centro di quella che, assieme alla panoramica a salire sul Brill Building e sui relativi generi musicali, \u00e8 una delle scene pi\u00f9 belle del film. In essa, Valli sta seduto da solo in un diner dopo la morte della figlia mentre fuori cade la neve e viene raggiunto da Bob Gaudio (il tastierista e compositore del gruppo, interpretato da Erich Bergen) che gli propone lo spartito con il quale trovare la forza di ripartire: un insieme di narrazione e inquadrature che dice molto della sensibilit\u00e0 di un regista che sa ben raccontare la malinconia. Un altro tema caro a Eastwood \u00e8 il rapporto padre-figlio, che qui per\u00f2 appare solo in una dimensione secondaria: in tutta la pellicola il registro drammatico risulta solo accennato (si veda anche il difficile rapporto di Valli con la moglie) e fatica ad amalgamarsi al tono da commedia che caratterizza l'andamento complessivo quando in scena non ci sono le canzoni (che sono, ovviamente, parecchie, a partire dalla celeberrima \u2018Sherry\u2019). Tra i tanti pregi dello zio Clint \u00e8, del resto, anche la notevole capacit\u00e0 di mettere in immagini la musica, sia quando essa \u00e8 protagonista, sia quando \u00e8 parte integrante nello sviluppo della storia e questo anche quando il genere \u00e8 lontano dalle sue preferenze (che come noto, sono orientate al jazz): perch\u00e9 il tutto risultasse pi\u00f9 efficace, il regista ha voluto che gli interpreti fossero gli stessi del musical (Young ha vinto un Tony per la sua interpretazione teatrale) o comunque provenissero da quel mondo e le canzoni sono state eseguite direttamente sul set. Su un tocco di nostalgia per gli anni migliori che non tornano pi\u00f9 \u2013 dal palco della Hall of Fame il ricordo torna al vecchio quartiere \u2013 si chiude una pellicola che, per quanto detto in precedenza e perch\u00e9 il coinvolgimento emotivo non riesce sempre ad essere al massimo, non \u00e8 certo un capolavoro, ma che comunque garantisce due ore leggere di ottimo intrattenimento. Il che, poi, \u00e8 un problema per l\u2019ex Biondo (che si cita in un fotogramma da \u2018Rawhide\u2019): da lui ci si aspetta sempre il colpo d'ala e, quando si limita al solido mestiere, c\u2019\u00e8 sempre qualcuno che finisce per storcere il naso.",

The film is a 2 hour show of why Frankie Valli should be known in the world and rather than letting the Frankie Valli story prove his significance through an autobiographical film. It seems the movie is trying to ruthlessly 'convince' the audience that Frankie Valli is great and a wiseguy. Also the portrayal of Italian culture at times was deeply comical and borderline offensive. The portrayal of gangster culture and figures was deeply cliche and stereotypical and you can tell that nobody involved in writing has ever seen basic gangster classics like Goodfellas. If I had to describe the movie, it would be like a high school play about Frankie Valli with the cast being the local prep squad and drama club who have never seen a crime genre movie in their lives. Clint Eastwood fails at trying to prove himself as a director miserably. This is one movie where nobody feels lucky at the end.",
