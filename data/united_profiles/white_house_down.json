While Olypmus has fallen is failing to persuade you that it isn't a generic thriller, White House Down is having fun and you are too. When armed terrorists seize the White House, visitor John Cale (Channing Tatum) is forced to protect President Sawyer (Jamie Foxx) and try to rescue his daughter Emily (Joey King) from them. The film is big, unpretentious fun which emulates the original Die Hard, not just in story but in its tone. White House Down is funny and has a cast clearly revelling in the experience. Tatum is a good Willis replacement and he shares great chemistry with Foxx who provides most of the films comedy. Directed by Roland Emmerich, the director of other big budget actioners such as 2012 and Independence Day, White House Down isn't subtle, its in your face and it never really slows down as everything is thrown at you at a break neck pace. Filled with cliches aplenty this is big budget B movie film making at its best. Emmerich manages to twist formulas to keep things trundling along as well as display the action in a new and interesting way. The films script by James Vanderbilt isn't terrible but there are more than a few dodgy lines hidden throughout the film. Clearly Emmerich is trying to display himself as a storyteller and while White House Down has a good story and is a gripping thriller it is a completely recycled tale that just follows an outline, an outline laid out by one of the best action films made making it entertaining action but nowhere near original.",

      "text": "Roland Emmerich\u2019s White House Down (not to be confused with Antoine Fuqua\u2019s Olympus Has Fallen) follows John Cale (Channing Tatum), a US Capitol Police officer assigned with protecting the Speaker of the House (played by Richard Jenkins). Cale\u2019s estranged daughter, Emily (Joey King), is a political junkie and in an effort to win her favor, he applies for a position with the U.S. Secret Service  and joins her for a tour of the White House. However, when a fringe terrorist group lays siege to the White House, Cale manages to free U.S. President James Sawyer (Jamie Foxx) from his captors  unfortunately, Emily is taken hostage in the process. As the paramilitary intruders scour the White House in search of Sawyer, Cale becomes the only person who can both save Emily and escort the President to safety  not to mention, stand between the hostile force and their goals of global devastation. As a director and producer, Emmerich is known for his extensive resume of blockbuster action movies, with enormous CGI spectacle and ensemble casts, including Stargate, Independence Day, Godzilla, The Day After Tomorrow, and 2012, among others. As a result, many moviegoers will likely be expecting the same over-the-top approach and large-scale CGI destruction that has become a staple in his action movie offerings. However, even though White House Down includes memorable blockbuster moments, it\u2019s much more straightforward and focused (though just as eccentric)  sold primarily by the team of Tatum and Foxx, not explosive visuals. As a result, the film is much more akin to the one-man-army formula seen in favorites like Die Hard, as Foxx and Tatum divide their time between sneaking in the shadows and gun/fist fighting (with plenty of cathartic one-liners thrown into the mix). A couple of extravagant set-pieces punctuate the core hide-and-shoot formula to ratchet up the excitement and explosions to summer spectacle level, but anything in between is mostly flimsy filler designed to move the plot forward to the next action encounter. The result is an enjoyable action hero tour of the bullet-riddeled White House grounds  albeit one that will require viewers to switch-off their brains on more than one occasion. Despite some tongue-in-cheek banter between Cale and Sawyer (as well as the main villains), the White House Down story takes itself pretty seriously at times  making an effort to ground the proceedings in contemporary geo-politics. Attempts to center the movie around present-day issues help make twists and turns in the plot relevant, but Emmerich\u2019s sometimes on-the-nose message results in predictable revelations and fallout that might be off-putting to certain viewers (especially anyone who disagrees with the director\u2019s banal characterization of the political arena). Of course, White House Down is not designed to be a provocative drama about political maneuvering, it is (above all else) a silly summer action film. In service of that goal, the core story and characters are competent in their jobs  even if Emmerich spends a bit too much time spinning a web of political corruption. Channing Tatum brings an entertaining mix of campy humor and unrelenting action chops, which should not come as a surprise to viewers who enjoyed seeing the actor flex his comedy wit and/or muscles in 21 Jump Street, Magic Mike, or Haywire, in addition to others. Cale isn\u2019t the most nuanced character that Tatum has played, but he\u2019s a serviceable (although ultimately forgettable) leading man  one that audiences should have no problem following from firefight to fistfight for the majority of the film. Jamie Foxx is equally entertaining as President Sawyer, delivering fun twists to standard commander-in-chief tropes while serving as an especially amusing foil to Cale. Sawyer is behind a number of the White House Down\u2018s best moments and even though he\u2019s accountable for a few eye-rolling setbacks, his personal quirks and bold stance in the face of uncertainty offset any derivative plot setups. Supporting players are also strong and include Jason Clarke, Maggie Gyllenhaal, James Woods, and (as mentioned) Richard Jenkins, along with several other familiar faces (such as The Wire, Lost, and Fringe alum Lance Reddick). After a string of standout side roles (in Zero Dark Thirty and Lawless, to name a few), Clarke gets to enjoy a bit more screen time this round as mercenary leader, Emil Stenz  a sharp counterpoint to Tatum\u2019s John Cale in both cunning and physical strength. Emmerich has produced a competent (read: not essential) blockbuster thriller that is likely to satisfy filmgoers who were intrigued by the trailers and/or core premise  and the pairing of Tatum and Foxx provides plenty of worthwhile character moments to carry the film through any predictable or underwhelming story beats. However, even with those good points, White House Down ultimately falls short of classic films in the genre (i.e., Die Hard).",

      "text": "White House Down is another Die Hard clone and a decent summer flick. Roland Emmerich has created blockbuster disasters including Independence Day, The Day After Tomorrow, and 2012 and now we have another disaster film where the White House was corrupted by terrorists in Washington D.C. The story is about U.S. Capitol Police Officer, John Cale (Channing Tatum) and his daughter are heading to the White House and he's promoting to become a president's bodyguard; however, the terrorists are planning to take over the White House and plan to kidnap the president, James Sawyer (Jamie Foxx). Both heroes must find the way to get out of the White House and they need to fight over terrorists with big guns and explosives. The action scenes are very impressive like the capitol building was destroyed, the helicopters are firing over the White House, and car chase scene was epic. The actors did very well in the movie including Channing Tatum plays an American Hero like he's becoming a John McClane or acting like Arnold Schwarzenegger in Commando. Jamie Foxx did very well as a president who acts like a Barrack Obama with guns White House is action packed thrill than A Good Day to Die Hard or Olympus Has Fallen. It has a lot fun to enjoy, the scenes are humorous, and it has good old action style like Lethal Weapon or Die Hard, but this movie is good. Thumb Up.",

Channing Tatum isn't terrible and the girl playing his daughter does a good job, but the final and inevitable fight between Channing's character and his nemesis is so over the top and absurd you just start rolling your eyes and get a strong urge to walk out of the theatre.",

This storyline is remarkably similar to that of \"Olympus Has Fallen,\" from three months ago, but there are some fundamental differences. \"White House Down\" employs plenty of humor, which allows the viewer to just enjoy the viewing experience. There are many casualties in \"WHD\", but there is hardly any bloodshed. In contrast \"Olympus,\" decided to include graphic violence, making it a challenge to just have fun in nothing more than a brainless blockbuster.",

Like Olympus Has Fallen, White House Down had a lot of great action and some cool special effects. Also like it, this movie was a ridiculously unrealistic premise the was the foundation of the entire film and made the immersion nearly impossible. I'm sorry but a handful of guys are not going to single-handedly take over the most secure building in the world, especially not by force. Unlike the other movie, however, this film doesn't take itself too seriously. Mostly thanks to Jamie Foxx, there is a lot of subtle humor that adds a certain sense of comedic relief. While that is a strength, it is also a weakness because it, once again, breaks the immersion in the setting. World War 3 is about to happen and you've got jokes? Sorry, not buying it.

At its worst, the film is kinda grating and unfunny and way too over the top (but Roland Emmerich DID direct it) and at its best, the film is fun, has some great action and Jaime Foxx and Channing Tatum are a decent and amusing duo.  The worst part, however, is the terrible green screen composite shots outside of the White House.  They looked so surreal and fake that the film felt like it took place in some alternate reality...however, that's sort of fitting since the entire movie felt like a live action cartoon.",
