While it might follow the typical team-formula like most generic movies about competitions, the biggest credit to the movie is it's actual accuracy regarding the subject matter.  One moment in particular that showed the attention to detail that really caught my attention was that when an electrical component was submerged and shorted, it didn't die.  In reality, most technology survives water so long as the device is 100% dried out first.  In addition to that, the second biggest surprise was George Lopez's acting.  I know him first and foremost as a comedian, and typically comedians make terrible actors in anything remotely serious, but he did a much better job than I expected to the point where I wasn't convinced it was George Lopez until the end.",
