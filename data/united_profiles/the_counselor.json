For reasons unbeknown to us he decides to go into the drug business, and pseudo-intellectual existential dialogues between the protagonists ensue, with the main focus being on greed and how sexual everything appears to them. Cheetahs chasing jackrabbits is sexual, a yellow Ferrari is so sexual that Diaz' character decides to make-out with it (yes, you read that correctly). The Counsellor is constantly being counselled on life and it's meaning by philosophical drug-dealers and cartel members. The tediousness of these overdrawn, often repetitive and rather self-indulged exchanges make the film feel so ill paced. The chemistry between the two main couples (Fassbender-Cruz, Bardem-Diaz) was non-existent. The characters are hardly developed. Were we suppose to empathise with the Counsellor? The acting was NOT good. The ultimate attraction to this film, for me, was the cast who in it's majority has seldom - if ever - let me down. And yet, here, even they were, to put it mildly, not on top form. The emphasis had been given on the aforementioned dialogue, something that was more obvious when the main plot of the film became increasingly convoluted and thus hard to follow. At the end all I felt was content that it was over. This is, unfortunately, the worst film I've seen this year.",

Most students, if not all, refrain from applying a Hollywood budget, getting Ridley Scott to direct and having Brad Pitt et al in these showcases though and maybe McCarthy should have thought twice about having his screenplay debut in such a fashion and kept to the more traditional avenue of a few friends in a small theatre.

This one is about the long and unerring reach of a Mexican cartel who, if we believe the movie, have eyes and ears better than the NSA, and a brutality that exceeds the Taliban. Fans of McCarthy know that the violence is as inevitable as it is preposterously excessive. This time he sends us a telegram in the early going about just how it will occur. and then it's just up to the viewer to decide whether the message was worth delivering. For me it wasn't. The endless philosophizing about death, evil, and the inevitability of justice \"Cartel style\" wasn't just depressing but boring. Oh it's stylish enough and Ridley Scott has a great visual bag of tricks, but it's choice of looking at evil with sophistication simply shows it's banality, and that wasn't the point of the movie.

The main criticism I've heard is that the plot is \"incoherent\" or \"difficult to follow\". All I can do in response is quote the film's existential center, Westray: \"Are you a mental defective?\" I'm not usually a fan of intellectual elitism, but I must say this film is perfectly coherent and the plot is brilliantly apparent to anyone with a fully-functioning frontal lobe. No, the script does not spoon feed the audience, but that only makes the film even more entertaining. As I mentioned before, the film's only flaw is that Cameron Diaz is attempting to play an evil genius. She is completely wrong for the role. I haven't seen her in a ton of films, so I don't know if she has any acting talent in any \"type\" of role, but I'm going to give her the benefit of the doubt and assume that she's very gifted at portraying \"bubbly\" characters who are sexually effervescent in a very playful way. This role is not in her wheelhouse. When she stumbles over Cormac McCarthy's ingenious existential monologues one can only cringe and lament that the film did not stick the landing because of this one glaring flaw. Her character is self-parodic because she does not have the talent to make these brilliant soliloquies seem believable. Frankly Diaz makes Malkina seem like a ditz, especially in the final monologue which with another actress, Charlize Theron maybe,  would have been a home run. This film is the best argument against the drug war that I've ever seen, and the dialogue is the best I've ever heard in any movie, period. Except when it's clumsily spit out of Cameron Diaz's mouth. The material was over her head. The other actors, Brad Pitt especially, take the excellent dialogue and run with it.",

Densely written by Cormac McCarthy, The Counselor shows that McCarthy was not willing to compromise his style in translating it to the screen. With SAT words aplenty, McCarthy's script is alien with characters forced to say lines that no human being in these situations would ever dream of actually speaking. However, in doing so, McCarthy sets up The Counselor to be a film that is not some crime drama, but instead a poetic and mythical film that hardly bears any resemblance to reality. That said, this language - as it is in his novels - is beautiful to hear. Though it is this language that undeniably contributes to the film's divisiveness, it is also its problems with apparent filler and its incoherent narrative. What is not for debate, however, is the brilliance of the acting. They take this messy material and turn it into a chaotically beautiful work that, though flawed, will likely become a favorite of cinephiles for years to come for the very flaws that it has.",
