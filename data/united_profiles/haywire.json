I accept that's not what the film ever aimed to be, but because of the misleading trailers and publicity I can't help but feel a little duped. What Haywire actually is, is a pretty old-fashioned slow-burning spy movie with the occasional bone-crunching fight scene to savour. All due credit to Steven Soderbergh, the film is shot beautifully (particularly the Dublin sequence), has some nice stylistic touches, and the film as a whole isn't anywhere near as far up its own backside as some of his previous directorial efforts (Ocean's films I'm looking at you!). Gina Carano makes a decent, confident protagonist, and her mixed martial arts background makes the various scrapes that Mallory Kane gets into extremely creative, brutal and entertaining to watch. Michael Douglas also appears to relish his role as a high-ranking government agent, and his performance as an authority figure is very believable now that he's the spitting image of his dad. The rest of the cast I found a little underwhelming, with Ewan McGregor and Channing Tatum coasting, Antonio Banderas playing Antonio Banderas, and Michael Fassbender, though continuing to prove himself as a decent character actor, still slips back into his natural Irish lilt now and again. The actors' failings may have been overlooked had the script been decent, but Lem Dobbs' dialogue leaves a lot to be desired, and is probably the element that detracts most from the film as a whole. The pace of the film is extremely uneven too, and no matter how interesting Soderbergh makes his numerous long takes, you may find yourself pining for a few more all-out scraps. Maintaining a shot for the sake of tension only works up to a point, and after he pulled this trick for the third or fourth time I found my attention waning. I also found the conclusion to this story, which started so well, completely underwhelming. It may be good-looking, well-choreographed, and well-told up until the final act, but in the end, I found Haywire a little lifeless, and occasionally quite dull.",

      "text": "Haywire is not just a great action film; its a great film as it acts as a callback to classic 60s spy thrillers while injecting a modern mentality thanks to some truly breath-taking fight scenes and car chases. Haywire is a strange amalgam of Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy and The Bourne Series as it portrays a woman who isnt afraid to throw down but can and will use her intelligence to get her out of a situation or solve a puzzle. The film follows Mallory, a freelance special ops agent as she is framed for something she didnt do and is forced to go on the run and figure out who set her up and why. The film opening scene sets the tone for the rest of the film with a tension and intelligence that is quite unique. The film revels in its brutality but it is never over the top with Haywire still feeling light on action in comparison to modern action films. Its the scenes where she is not engaging in fisticuffs that bring the film to life. Soderbergh manages to ratchet up the tension while maintaining the slick pace and feel of the film. There is a wonderful sense of paranoia running through the film that further emphasises the cold war mentality that Soderbergh is going for with everyone acting as a suspect in the overall conspiracy. The constant questioning of the men we are presented as they interact with Mallory provides for some really great scenes, especially the scenes she shares with Channing Tatum and Michael Fassbender. Carano brings not just physicality to the role (she did all her own stunts and is a trained mixed martial artist) but also sexuality as she toys with the people she meets. Her interaction (as mentioned above) with Tatum and Fassbender is particularly great as she has great chemistry with both of them and it provides a lightness to the scenes that was sorely needed. Gina Carano may not be an Oscar worthy actor but she is a dynamic lead and provides a great screen presence . The rest of the supporting cast work well too with Michael Douglas and Antonio Banderas providing some much needed gravitas. The only person who disappoints is Ewan Mcgregor who seems to rely a little too much on charm as he coasts through the movie. The chase scene in Dublin is some of the finest direction in an action film as it plays on not only Mallorys paranoia but also the viewers. The script isnt brilliant but if anything it does properly bring out Mallorys stoic nature while also showing off her intelligence and sexuality. Its a wonderful character to follow and its surprising (and welcome) to see such a character played by someone other than Angelina Jolie. Haywire is a wonderful film thanks to some ingenious direction by Steven Soderbergh, a great supporting cast and a multi-faceted lead in Gina Carano.",

Gina Carano  sadly doesn't. Yes, she is a fighter but an actress? And that's the main problem with the whole film. She lacks the conviction and chrisma as an actress. That aside, the plot seemed enticing. An ex-black ops soldier sets out to avenge those who betrayed her during a mission unraveling the conspiracy in the process. I was fooled! Actually, the film was sold on the premise of unfair and unmerited comparisons because where the likes of Bauer, Bond and Bourne all exceed in the genre this film fails. Apart from the brutal and at times barbaric fight sequences it's all meaningless. It's very lightweight in that department because it doesn't draw you in which I was surprised at given the nature of the cast. Ewan McGregor, Michael Fassbender, Channing Tatum, Antonio Banderas and Michael Douglas are all in the movie so you would have been forgiven for expecting a good movie. Ultimately I found Haywire to be a huge letdown and an opportunity gone begging, they had the star names in abundance to succeed however they delivered nothing more a mediocre movie at best, great shame!",

      "text": "This came as a bit of a surprise to me as you almost never find a movie as good as this in January. I realize that critics clearly enjoyed this more then people which should say something. That this movie was marketed as something completely different then it truly was. I realize this is the case with all of the director's work. The same thing happened with Contagion and Magic Mike which I both liked very much. So if you ever plan on seeing this movie, don't believe what the trailer tells you. This is a very odd film. Yes it's an action film but it's different than what you're use to, which is why so many people disliked it. I can't explain it but it's just different and I'll admit, it did bother me too. The music does not fit the movie at all. I'm not sure what the director was trying to do here but 90% of the music was this weird 70's jazz music that you would find in a spy movie from that period. Whatever the case, it was annoying and sometimes took me out of the movie. These were really the only things that bothered me. I mean the director choose to shoot the movie in a variety of ways, some shots work, others don't, but it didn't bother me much. It might be off-putting to some of you though and that's one example in which I said earlier that this movie is different. It's not shot in a way your typical action movie is. So despite those problems I enjoyed everything else. The action is fantastic, it's very well choreographed. There's no music accompanying the action scenes which make them seem more realistic and thus, another example of how this is different from your typical action film. The story is nothing new, this is after all a revenge flick, but the director adds enough of his visual flair and fresh ideas to make this movie stand above your typical revenge flick. The cast is solid and for a first time performance Gina Carano was not bad. Was it a terrific performance? No, but she has potential. She would make a good Wonder Woman but that's just me. I hope she gets more roles because watching her kick ass was definitely worth the price of admission. The other person worth noting is Channing Tatum. This has been a good year for him in both in terms of box office and career. Now, I haven't seen The Vow and I don't have any intentions of seeing it anytime soon, but he has definitely reversed my opinion of him. With this, 21 Jump Street, and Magic Mike, I can't believe I'm saying this but, he can act. I hope now he decides to pick smart scripts and make smart choices because he has finally proven(it's been like what 6 years?) that he's got the chops. Overall, a nice surprise since normally January is considered a dumping ground as a majority of the films are Hollywood rejects. This is another great movie from a great director who has been having a good year himself with this, Magic Mike, and last year's Contagion, he's slowly becoming one of my favorite directors. Sure this movie is very different, the music doesn't fit it at all, there's no music during the fight scenes, and some of the shots work better than others. However, the action is nice choreographed a nice-shot, no shaky-cam, the cast gives solid performances and how could you not find Gina Carano kicking ass not exciting or hot?",

      "text": "This was a fascinating action film. It has more than its fair share of violence, which usually doesn't appeal to me, but the violence is so intrinsically linked to the plot that the movie just would not work without it. The heroine of the film is an ex-Marine who can put James Bond to shame. She's strong, beautiful, and fearless, and has catlike agility and intuition. The violent scenes are mostly her beating up all the men who try to betray her, subdue her, or hire contractors to kill her.  She always triumphs over them--she is invincible.  She ends up killing a couple of them, which is probably not necessary--women usually are a little more forgiving than that, although it should be noted that every character she kills was someone who tried to kill her first. From a purely feminist point of view, this movie is an important addition to the canon--no helpless females who have to count shrill, convincing screams as being an important part of their acting skills. (I've never screamed in my life, so why are actresses always screaming?) The character of Mallory Kane is played by newcomer Gina Carano, who in real life is a renowned expert at Muay Thai, the official sport of Thailand, a martial art that is basically a form of kickboxing. Muay Thai was Carano's primary claim to fame before her breakthrough role in Haywire. She is all muscle and guts--I don't think she needed a stunt woman to double for her in any scenes.  She makes Angelina Jolie look like a princess. The film also marks Michael Douglas's comeback after his illness. He looks better than ever in the role of Coblenz, the only disappointment being that we don't get to see enough of him. It's an easy and small role for him, but he was still extremely effective, as was Antonio Banderas, also onscreen too briefly, and Ewan McGregor, who plays a surprisingly ambiguous character despite his conservative, clean-cut exterior.",

She has the physique that makes her believable as a former special ops character; the parsimonious dialogue and superb fight choreography was a wise choice, Carano has not yet earned her chops as actor for her to get more than she had to speak here. If you're looking for a smart action thriller, a movie fix you need to satisfy from time to time, this movie should do the job. The movie starts and ends abruptly with one spoken word, the same word; that one word at the beginning takes one fight scene, a minute or so into the movie, no less striking than in the Bourne movies, to realise how well chosen it was. At the end, when the bad guy simply sees Carano and utters that word, you don't need to see another fight scene, you can imagine it vividly; that's the mark of a smart script and directing.",

Anyone who has followed her career knows that she is an extremely capable fighter, and she shows off her athletic dexterity admirably and believably in the film. She's a much more believable action star than, say, Angelina Jolie, and it's exciting to witness her antics with her numerous male adversaries in the film. However, given the bland, generic storyline (you've seen it a million times before) coupled with very poor writing and lack of true suspense, the film ends on a very dull note. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, is the fact that Carano is an absolutely terrible actress. She just had no idea what she was doing, and she lacked even the slightest emotional connection to her role. This really is too bad and the film would have gained a lot if she had been more prepared.
