However, in the end, when the main plot finds its way, all the little things that were left hanging during the movies become teasers that leave you with a bittersweet sensation of \"I wanted a little more\".

I really impressed by Backdraft cause the way the director describe the fire is like a living persons that breath and ready to burn and destroy everything.That fire also can be a very dangerous weapon.Guess all the moviegoers must remember The Da Vinci Code. The thing that i saw in Backdraft is recurred again in Ron Howard's new movie. Set back in 1820 when the Essex whale ship's voyage must face the deadly assault by a 90 feet sperm whale.This movie stars based the storytelling by Tom Nickerson-the only ex crew of Essex that still alive- to a novel writer Herman Melville.A young novelist that have this ambition to write one of the most spectacular fiction adventure novel ever written. A whale ship that sail under the navigation of Captain Pollard (Benjamin Walker)-a captain by ancestry and off course lack of experience- assist by Owen Chase (Chris Hemsworth)1st Class Sailor-who also reluctantly but have no choice but to accept this task by the owner of Essex ship.Takes a very short time for this 2 character involved in psychological war between them.At first Essex managed to catch a whale, but after a few months of traveling, where food stocks thinning finally Chase and Pollard decided to divert the direction of the ship towards the path of tropical waters of the Pacific-after hearing the story of a Ship Captain Spain who survived the attack from 90 feet white whale.However, both Chase and Pollard ignored the warning from the Spanish Captain. A decision based on ambition and greed which then carry Essex into a catastrophe. they only imagine hundreds of whales on display in front of the eyes waiting to be hunted and brought home 2000 gallons of whale oil.And then, Essex was brutally attacked by a whale with a size that was never imagined by them. Essex ship was sinking to the bottom of the Pacific ocean. And crew who survived the attack separated into three boats had to live in the shadow of a very painful death.Stranded in tropical oceans where sunlight stings during daytime as whole body skin burns. In the course to survive, all the crew had to face moral dilemmas by do the abomination or die slowly in pain. Once again Ron Howard managed to do what he's really excel,the whale that destroyed the Essex described not only as a ferocious monster but as a god of the ocean, the whale protectors of human greed. Internal conflicts between cockiness Pollard as the ship's captain and Chase as a seaman 1st class who is an expert in calculating weather and sharper instincts. A little unfortunate that this film only lasted 2 hours which I think is not enough time for Ron Howard to explore the burden of the old Tom Nickerson who have to live for decades with terrible memories. Also not enough time to explore the mental burden of the young novelist Melville (Whisaw). And looks like Ron Howard strive very hard to share a story segment. Even if the film is not a masterpiece but I feel satisfaction in watching this movie. Even if all the actors act well, but it is the whale measured 90 feet that steal the show.Whale is described as being so characterized, the authority that gives lessons so valuable that a knowledge sometimes requires sacrifice so heartbreaking. Ambitions that humans will someday be stopped by the might of the children of nature.",

I'm happy to say that this movie was surprisingly good! Sure, the pacing was slow and at a few parts it got dull. But away from that I though it was a fun watch. The movie's build up was long, It took almost the entire movie to get to the actual meat of the film. The acting wasn't phenomenal but was most definitely watchable especially the ones from Chris Hemsworth and Tom Holland. For the time they are on screen together, they have a very watchable chemistry. The whole Mentor and Mentee thing going on between them is quite enjoyable. The cinematography and visual effects were absolutely breathtaking. Every time you see Moby Dick destroying the ships and wrecking havoc is just tension filled and heart pumping. The darker twist in the movie was supposed to cause \u201coh's\u201d and \u201cah's\u201d but I didn't see it. It felt forced into cause drama but just like Legend. You can't take it out of that true story because it is a true story and people would feel cheated. In the end, This movie was surprising. The setup went on a little too long and the writing was weak at times but besides that, beautiful. I'm giving this one a 6/10 (a positive 6/10).",

      "text": "A truly great book ends up being a mediocre movie.  With such a ready made story, it's shocking the film does not succeed.  Because the movie spends so much time focusing on the recurring narrative technique which has Herman Melville meeting with the last living survivor of the Essex (the usually incomparable Gleeson), it loses the opportunity to character develop the two main characters on the ship.  Thus, when the encounter with the whale and its aftermath ensues, the viewer has little emotionally invested in any of the survivors.  Apart from spectacular visuals with the whale, the movie has little going for it in any area.  Recommend the viewer invest in the book for a well told, exciting and amazing true life adventure story.",
