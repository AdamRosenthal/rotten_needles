A movie that besides being very funny, makes us think a little about the real value of things, consumer goods considered, perhaps, futile... and rethink this a bit absurd consumerism and publicist who are bombing targets daily.",

The acting was solid and the movie moved it's self along at a nice pace. There were some parts of the movie that were a little clunky and out of place and some of the characters could have been deleted. Overall it's a very enjoyable movie and a good date movie.",

Let's go to the MALL!\"-type of movies. Is that really your type of movie? Even if you are a \"shopaholic\" (quote-unquote) yourself, it just appears stupid to waste a whole hour and forty-four minutes of your life watching a stupid chick show that she CLEARLY doesn't know how to handle her money, along with keeping away from her ex-boyfriend (\"'cause OMG!

The fact is, that even though, the cast was excpetional and the message of the movie was unique, the plot was kind of expectable. It always is hard to transfer a book into a movie! Fiser is really talented and the portrayal of a shopacholic really suited her. It was an enjoyable movie, with much laugh and amazing message. The fact that it was expectable, isn't important, because as I was watching the movie, everything happened so fast, that you didn't think: ''Oh  I was sure this was going to happen!   Very optimistic and with promising actors, in my opinion.",
