OK so the movie follows John Smith(played by Alex Pettyfer) who is an alien part of a group of nine of his kind that escaped his planet before they were killed. Numbers one, two, and three are dead, so now the Mog are coming after him. He has to find a way to stop them or he's next. Do you wanna see this now? No? What's your problem? Lets get the story straight though. This is not a Twilight remake/rip-off. Yes, I can see some resemblances to Twilight but it really isn't like that at all. Alex Pettyfer was very good for his first big movie. He does his part very well and doesn't slip up. The girl he falls in love with, Sarah, played by Dianna Agron does fine but nothing really special. Number Six, played by Teresa Palmer does a great job in her role. She is just an awesome, gun wielding alien. But the man who steals the show is Timothy Olyphant who plays Henri, John's protector. Timothy Olyphant is always cool and awesome, but give him a sword and he is the ultimate badass in this movie. The script, to my surprise, was very well written. everything makes sense and there isn't and cringe-worthy dialogue. The special effects were spectacular. Everything from the lights coming out of his hands to the monsters he fights are extremely well done. My only gripe, and this is a very small one, is that the villains weren't really developed much. They were just there, I wish we learned more about them. But again, that is a very minor thing. Overall, I Am Number Four is the movie I have been waiting for since the start of the year. Definitely my favorite movie of the year so far.",

Initially, I thought it will be some kind of A Romance with Actions. Instead of that, it turns out to be Pure Action with a Romantic background. The chemistry between Alex and Sarah actually went pretty smoothly, but the proportion is too brief and not as intense as it should. The Director is D. J. Caruso who is well-known for DISTURBIA (2007) and EAGLE EYE (2008). After two or three scenes at the beginning, the movie atmosphere reminds me of one of those SMALVILLE TV series (2001-2011) which is including: the setting, the characters and the conflict. Most of the Action scenes are good enough to watch, though no further explanation about what is really happenning. I previously thought the Number Six character who is described as a sexy and energetic girl will be the scene stealer (played by my favorite rising star, Teresa Palmer). As a matter of fact, her character is too minor and there is the impression she is just a mere sweetener. At the end, the movie is closed by a situation which is opening a possibility of potential sequel. In summary, thiz is not a movie that you want to spend 100 minutes of your precious time. Unless, you are 16-year-old teen who are attracted to thiz kind of movie, then you should go to see it before your friends watch it first. For me, it is definitely not a number one.

But the term action packed is one I am using to uncover a flaw in the film. Through out the film there are constant action scenes with fights and explosions everywhere sometimes this can make a film shocking. But in I am number 4 the only shock to the system is seeing how unbelievably bad the special effects are. Bad special effects don't help when a film is like i said action packed.",

      "text": "Not only is John Smith(Alex Pettyfer) a Lorien, a creature from another planet(now a distant reminiscence) sent to Earth along with nine other estranged refugees, he's a Legacy, an extra-terrestrial with superhero potential. Henri(Timothy Olyphant), his guardian and surrogate parent(who is much more accesible than hologram projection of Marlon Brando's disembodied head), at every turn, encourages John to keep a low profile, and yet the father figure never broaches the s-word, the bane of the tan(and buff) alien's ability to disappear in plain sight. Worse than going blind, the unfounded threat made by Catholic priests to regulate morality since time immemorial, self-abuse, or rather, in this case, possessing impure thoughts about the opposite sex, as suggested by the incident on the Floridian beach at the outset of \"I Am Number Four\", have actual physical ramifications on the very instruments that pollute one's own, and the other's temple. Blue lights shoot out of John's hands, a twilight emission of electronic fluid, coaxed from the palms when the skinny dipper of a female persuasion gets closer to Four(aka John), the sexually excited alien. John's real father, as well as his mother, both killed back at the home planet on the day it exploded, would be better able to handle their son's growing pains than Henri, who reluctantly allows his charge to enroll in school without ever addressing the pitfalls of an intensely coed environment. Shirking off his parental duties back in the Sunshine State nearly undermined their efforts to elude detection from the Margorains(their gills suggest a race of sharks that are a thousand generations removed from their Earth-bound ancestors). The promotion of a celibate lifestyle catches up with the otherwise detail-oriented Henri, in which John, the unlikeliest of virgins, having been sheltered from matters concerning his body, looks panic-stricken when he lights up the ocean and night sky with his hormones, suggestive of, perhaps, the legacy's ill-preparedness in dealing with late-blooming puberty, similar to the titular character in Brian DePalma's \"Carrie\"(played by Sissy Spacek), who was never told about menstrual blood, much to the delight of her high school peers. \"I Am Number Four\", or rather, \"I Am the Superman Origin Story\", leaves the question about inter-species sex unanswered. In Richard Donner's \"Superman II\", the Man of Steel surrenders his otherworldly powers in order to explore the physical side of love with Lois Lane(Margot Kidder), because according to the Jor-el hologram, Superman(Christopher Reeve) has to be human before he can love like a man. John, on the other hand, thinks like a man, in which the alien's infatuation with Sarah(Dianna Argon) informs his confrontations with Mark(Jake Abel), Sarah's ex, who provokes the numbered humanoid into spilling more blue light, therefore compromising the desired anonymity that the Loriens covet. Towards the end, \"I Am the Superman Origin Story\" turns into \"I Am Six the Margorian Slayer\", when Four is joined by a duplicate Buffy(played by Teresa Palmer), in what, admittedly, turns out to be a rousing action-packed finale, highlighted by a shape-shifting beagle, against the backdrop of a Whedon-esque setting, a high school, where good and evil hash things out with a maximum of sound and fury. Choosing spectacle over story, \"I Am Number Four\", obviously cross-marketed for both sexes, leaves the girls(who loved \"Twilight\") behind by not exploring the potential hazards that may arise from spending one night of passion with a \"little green man\" from outer space.",

The lack of originality didn't matter for this reviewer.  The villains were horrible - the kind who you wouldn't want to meet out-and-about - yet they held a strange rockstar appeal in their long black coats.  The special effects were tremendous, and although there were almost no plot surprises for an older movie watcher, there were plenty of well-crafted moments to keep it alive.

Perhaps the script, as well as the film as a whole, was held back by Walt Disney Studios' constraints, but even so this is a film that targets kids younger than those portrayed in the film. The underlying teen romance subplot is unnecessary and totally holds back the flow of the film. As stated by a few critics, Bay has attempted to ride of the success of Twilight and other teen love films by incorporating those elements into a mostly action/sci-fi oriented film, but he's come up short. Timothy Olyphant is the most talented member of the cast, and it shows - but given the overall poor acting this isn't really saying much. It's a nice looking film, with impressive visual effects and passable cinematography, but neither of these elements can hold up a film on their own, and I can't help but feel that more of what was obviously a huge budget should have gone towards signing on more experienced actors. I Am Number Four is an effective film in that it will appeal to it's target demographic, but anyone outside that will likely end up pretty disappointed.",

I've never seen him in anything before, but he gives the story an added bonus and much needed side story. Many critics bashed this film, saying it was an alien version of Twilight, but it couldn't be further from the truth. I Am Number Four isn't focused on the love aspect, a lot of action occurs and the story actually progresses, and this film isn't dark and narrow minded, the way the Twilight films have been. I Am Number Four kept my attention and interest throughout. I connected to the story and the characters as well as the actors, and I have no problem saying it is one of the best Science Fiction films I have a seen in years! ...and for those who feel the same way, the book sequel, The Power of Six will be released on August 23, and with any luck will hit the big screen next summer.",

I Am Number Four is worth your time if you like sci-fi action films but its nothing to go out of your way for.",

I think the film is alright, it could have been better and the villains are pretty bad but everything else in the film was rather good. I can see how that would cause problems in terms of sequels as I genuinely think that the villains would have tested badly with audiences across the globe. It was a good attempt at a tough sci-fi film.",

He always brings something to his characters, and I can say he was one of the best parts of this film. It is a passable sci-fi film.

So how did film studios react to this news? They decide to scrounge around for every possible young-adult book that could start a franchise in the same vein as \"Harry Potter\" and \"Twilight. This led them to \"I Am Number Four,\" a young-adult novel written by Pittacus Lore. How do they fare in making a franchise-starter? Well, five years later and still no sequel...guess that means they failed. But was the movie itself a failure? Not really. It was mildly entertaining, visually pretty solid, decently acted and very action-packed. If you're looking for a beautifully-written and meaningful film with memorable characters, you're not gonna find it here, but if you can turn your brain off, \"I Am Number Four\" is a relatively fun diversion.",

Maybe a bit since this film is aimed at younger audiences which is something that evidently escaped 99% of the critics that reviewed it. I don't think the movie was tailer made for the small group of wealthy younger people ...some other films are around these days that do cater to that particular sect of society. Cruel Intentions would fall into that category....and maybe the film Southland Tales also....and just about every film that Adam Sandler does (jeez I can't stand that guy)...or that Zack Efronn or Seth Rogan does also (can't stand them either) I guess theres more than a few films that won't appeal to too many young people-anyhoo-this films worth a look.",
