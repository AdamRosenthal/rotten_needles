That being said the best thing about Son of No One is the story and the ideas and questions it poses. It does actually leave you thinking at the end. However that being said the ending itself is so remarkably over the top and idiotic it stops you asking those questions for some time because you are too busy trying to unravel the stupidity you just endured. The acting is wooden at the best of times with the best performance coming from 30 Rock's Tracy Morgan as a mentally damaged man who is scarred from the events of his childhood. The script is passable and does a decent job of managing the multiple characters even though some of them are entirely redundant (Juliette Binoche). This could have been a decent little film with a rewrite of the end and a few tweaks to the pace. The main problem is the pacing of the film which is trying so hard for a dark tone that it slows down considerably making The Son of No One, one of the slowest movie experiences ever. Its just so painfully dull at times that a scene that should come off as shocking just makes you long for the end. Its a shame because it has a lot going for it but it was just let down by the actors, the ending and the unbearable slowness.",

      "text": "In 2006, Dito Montiel made a name for himself by writing/directing the story of his youth in Brooklyn, A Guide To Recognizing Your Saints. In that film and in several others that have since followed, Montiel has shown an amazing ability to take little known stories from his neighborhood, and in amazing detail, tells those stories from multiple angles, introducing the world to complex and amazing stories that to the world, were nothing but a blurbs in the newspaper decades ago. The Son of No One is one of such story, and while it is an amazing one, with an outstanding cast, it's Montiel's attention to detail that ultimately comes back to bite him. Jonathan White (Channing Tatum) has become a New York City Police Officer and he has done so at a somewhat older age than most other people do. There is a bit of a learning curve, but White seems to be catching on quickly, but his education comes to a quick halt when he and his family start receiving messages claiming to know that White killed two people in cold blood. The story here was terrific and unbelievably true, not to mention the cast was impeccable, so what's with the low rating? As I said, Motiel's films are always very detail oriented and focus on all the angles, The Son of No One is no different, however, in this case, they spend to much time on the back story in flashbacks. There isn't enough focus on the events taking place in present day, and when Channing Tatum is on screen, he's usually doing nothing that relates to the case, i.e. arguing with his wife, talking to his partner, learning to be a cop. By the time we get the end, it seems to jump out of nowhere, as if forty-five minutes of the film is just missing somehow. Not to mention the flashbacks are also out of order, further confusing the story. I understand artistic license, but this isn't Pulp Fiction and I was confused for much of this film. That being said, the cast is still terrific and Dito Montiel is one of the most underrated writer/directors in Hollywood. The Son of No One is a miss, but don't let that turn you off to the rest of amazing body of work.",
