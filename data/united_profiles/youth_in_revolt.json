Youth in Revolt, however, was not good.  Cera was playing what is basically the only character he is ever asked to play, many of the people I was interested in seeing had disappointingly small roles (Zach Galifianakis, Fred Willard), and the plot was surprisingly dull.  Portia Doubleday's character was painfully annoying, and I had absolutely no vesting interest in seeing what happened to any of the characters.  In addition, there were a couple of distractingly out-of-place animated sequences that, albeit short, were nonetheless distracting.  The only thing keeping this from being worse than a 3/10 is the fact that I've seen movies that weren't just bad, but flagrantly offensive to my sensibilities.  Youth in Revolt was merely bad.",

Even with the cast that features Steve Bucemi, Zach Galifinakis,Fred Willard and Ray Lolita, it still sucked! the plot was terrible, the jokes were not funny, I just wanted to shoot myself throughout the entire thing. I watched all of it to see if something good happened but NOTHING! Do yourself a favour and watch a GOOD Michael Cera movie like Scott Pilgrim Vs The World. but  don't watch this",

While his agent may want to spread out his role flexibility a bit, Michael shows he's perfected it with intellectual, social retard, Nick Twisp.  His humorous courtship of Sheeni Saunders via the rebellious Francois is adorable and just sweet enough to root for.  Surrounded by a surprising cast, including Steve Buscemi, Jean Smart, Ray Liotta, Fred Willard, Justin Long and Zach Galifianakis, this ensemble lends a very strong comedic foundation to the dark story.",

It is by shear talent that he thrives in these types of movies and that they become as good as they are. In order to be with his new girlfriend, Nick Twisp (Cera), needs to get kicked out of his house. Through a hidden persona he didn't know he had, he gets his wish, and that's when the adventure really begins. This movie makes up for a story that's been done, by throwing everything they've got at you. There are a ton of cameos, one liners, strange twists, mushrooms, and even some animation. Romantic comedies, definitely not my thing, but Youth In Revolt is something different. The writer really goes out of his way to make his simple story and his ordinary character something special. It actually turned out to be a pretty entertaining movie.",

It's not a laugh out loud comedy but it does deliver a warming, relatable character in the split personality of Nick Twisp. Even when he's causing trouble, you feel like rooting for Cera.
