But when a 9-year old obnoxious fellow swings on for the ride, Mr. Federickson has to learn to deal with him after a conflict arises once landing in South America. Up is definitely a film for the entire family to feel excited about. The intial first 10 minutes are very heartwarming, but loses that warmth a little once the adventure begins, soon feeling like a shorter, much toned down adventure once it ends. Without a doubt Pixar delivers quality animation once again, but the feeling is different once the end credits, the same I saw in Cars and Monster's Inc. But definitely another masterpiece for 2009.",

With the exception of The Incredibles, Pixar have traditionally stayed away from humans as central characters. However, in Up the main characters are Mr. Fredricksen, a lonely, grumpy old man and Russell, a plump young explorer scout. An unlikely pair who are unintentionally thrown together as Mr. Fredricksen transports his house to South America using helium filled balloons to escape moving from his home. There they meet a group of talking dogs, an endangered bird and Mr. Fredricksen's childhood hero as the adventure and fun continues.",

The only thing preventing from hating this one is the incredible voice performance from Ed Asner and the fantastic animation, as always, from Pixar. However, the rest really left much to be desired. I hated the beginning and did not find it sad in the least. It was cute sure, but I hate montages. This one is no different. It is a major storytelling cop-out and, as a result, it never resonated with me when the end result was revealed. Even more, that wound up being the best part of the story, which is truly astonishing. After creating this real, believable world, it delves into the absurd, stupid, and incredibly dumb (talking dogs?). The film felt so manufactured and manicured, it seemed to me that Pixar had found a formula they thought worked and could plug any story into. Tragically, it did not work with Up as it felt entirely fake and, as such, that prevented me from feeling any sort of emotion. I thought it would be this sad, funny, and entirely charming, experience, but instead I was left feeling incredibly annoyed as I waited for yet another lame attempt at a joke and some juvenile talk on the emotional impact of losing your spouse. Just let the damn house float away you moron. Plus, I have to ask; wouldn't Russell's mother wonder where the heck her son went? How can this old man, who is shown to be unable to do much of anything, be so agile towards the end? Just the magic of being around an annoying child? Anyways, Up is massively overrated. Though technically brilliant and Asner is a complete delight, so it is not all for naught, but I wonder if I watched a different film. The one I had had the worst storytelling of any Pixar film I have seen, felt completely contrived, and lack any sort of emotion. Instead, it was a dumb adventure romp that felt fake. Yes, I know Toy Story is about talking toys, but it feels real. Here, it felt like a bad parody of other Pixar films",

After a while the boredom wears off and it just gets annoying. Even for a children's film, dog's flying planes is just silly. It's the overload of plot devices that really brings down the film.

      "text": "A grumpy old coot, a chubby kid and a house hoisted by helium balloons \u2014 if you're thinking that Up sounds like a shortcut to sugar shock, snap out of it. Pandering to ninnies is not on the agenda for this latest landmark in Pixar animation. With Pete Docter and Bob Peterson sharing the directing and writing, Up is a breathtaking ride into the realm of pure imagination. Up shames the pap that now passes for family entertainment (yes, Night at the Museum 2, I'm talking to you).",

      "text": "Halarious emotional and even dark by some standards. Up is not afraid to make us bawl our eyes if it is happy tears or sad tears up has a brilliant voice cast and an coming of ages story that will appeal to nearly everyone. We follow an old man named Carl fredrickson who has been grumpy ever sense his wife died. One day a boy named Russel appears at his door step and through a variety of circumstances that will bring them closer than ever together. This movie is a sheer delight and it's no wonder why it won best picture at the academy awards. The voice actor who voices dug is a pure delight and the rest of the cast is too. Up is not only the perfect family movie one of he most perfect movies ever made. It's fun funny sad and even a little dark but underneath it's sometimes heavy narrative its a really excellent kids movie that will go down in history as a classic",
