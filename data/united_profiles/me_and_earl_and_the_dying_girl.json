However, this is basically not a romance and more about friendship. Just be careful, cause you're opting for around 20 minutes of non-stop sobbing. Me & Earl & the Dying Girl is a unique film in its own way, pushing all the cliches aside. The first 30 minutes may fall a bit flat but after that it gets better and better.",

I found the performances in the movie fairly dry to start out with but they did get a lot better as the film went on. I also felt like a film with heavy emotional plot like this would have more character development, sure the characters were complex but by the end of the film I still didn't really feel like I knew them. I think this is more of a hipster film and I'm sure there are going to be many people who find something they like about this movie I just wasn't satisfied. I really found several of the jokes kind of lame as well. I like the avoidance of clich\u00e9s in this film which is difficult with teen cancer film, but I'd take 50/50 over this movie any day, but that's just my opinion.",

      "text": "\"Me and Earl...\" is an earnest effort, and an admirable one, but it's never as witty or subversive as it thinks it is, coming across more as a self-conscious and uneven effort to mesh the populist appeal of \"The Fault in Our Stars\" with the quirky sensibilities of \"Juno\" rather than something truly unique. As a result, it can never find the right line between comedy and pathos and cannot handle either with particular consistency or efficacy. Some of it is funny and some of it is moving. Most of it is too uneven to truly be either. There is too much promise to write this off completely - the acting is very, very good and the finale is handled with such incredible delicacy and grace you can scarcely believe it's from the same film. But all in all it's a muddled affair that cannot reconcile its eccentricities with its emotions.",
