Come on people,it's Jackie Chan,the greatest martial arts master who fights and leaps on the poles,and making him downsize for his acting and hurting him so purpose. Even why George Lopez plays as a villain for taking over the world? He really needs to fire his agent! And why they put a teenager girl who finds this older boy so attractive and the older boy fights Jackie Chan?
