      "text": "Recently hired by an international conglomerate,  an American man (Owen Wilson) spirits his reluctant wife (Lake Bell) and daughters (Sterling Jerins and Claire Geare) from Texas to Southeast Asia.  On their first morning abroad, the fresh start is disrupted by an explosive coup and a subsequent wave of anti-Western mob violence.  With the help of a mysterious, seasoned expatriate (Pierce Brosnan), the family fights to stay a step ahead of their pursuers and escape to bordering Vietnam.  No Escape is a fast, vicious, and highly involving action-suspense film.  Wilson (in a relatively rare, but not unprecedented dramatic role) and Bell exude convincing parental desperation and dismay, while Brosnan is a scene-stealing delight, if a tad underutilized, as the debauched, jovial, unshaven Man with a Past Who Knows the Lay of the Land.  The film zips from one close-call-in-close-quarters set piece to the next, rarely pulling a punch in regard to violence and nicely maintaining momentum and a pervasive atmosphere of claustrophobia and paranoia.  The specter of potential xenophobia is present (this is a film in which a sympathetic white family is contrasted with and pit against a thronging Other, and there will be those who ignore the quality of the acting and craft on display because of this), but the film admirably, if a tad halfheartedly motions to temper this by also indicting Western corporations' acts of exploitation and resource plundering in the Third World.  I for one have no significant problem with a grind-house-spirited film such as this mining stranger-in-a-strange-land unease:  the spatial disorientation, the inability to easily communicate, etc.  After all, it is a real and recognizable experience and, by extension, a perfectly ripe subject for pulp entertainment.",

This movie about Jack Dwyer and his family who move to Southeast Asia to start a new life. Jack\u2019s company plans to improve the regions water, and he very quickly finds himself in the midst of an uprising of armed rebels. Essentially **** gets real, really real. Well that doesn\u2019t quite cover it, but thats the way I\u2019m going to put it. Honestly, I really liked this role on him. Not once did I think he was just being Owen Wilson, he becomes Jack, husband and father of two, who is just trying to keep his family safe at any cost. I\u2019d like to rate this at a 9/10 because of the intensity and how enthralled I got with it, but that is a ridiculous rating due to the overall lack of plot. I don\u2019t feel that takes away from it either, it ads to the experience in a way, you\u2019re just as confused as the family. \u201cNo Escape\u201d is quite the ride. You really start to think of the situation and how or if you would be able to handle it. Prepare yourself to jump throughout this and to see Pierce Brosnan be an badass.",

The story is Owen Wilson takes his family to Cambodia or somewhere near there for a relocation for his job and a coup starts up almost as soon as they land and I will leave it at that much.

The story is both generic and predictable, on top of that the story is a little too complex. Besides the story almost all of the characters have no development, besides Lake Bell's character who had a good amount of development. The villains were weak as they felt like nothing but faceless villains, if it weren't for one line of dialogue we'd have no idea why they are trying to kill these people. Lastly the camerawork is bad, there's absurd amounts of shaky cam, and the action sequences are almost impossible to follow. In conclusion the generic plot, weak character development and villains, and poorly shot action sequences make No Escape a mediocre action film, despite a good turn by Owen Wilson.",

This all unfolds after Owen Wilson leaves his hotel to buy a newspaper. On the way back he sees protesters facing off against police, but the protesters are more than just protesters, they are well armed rebels; they overpower and kill the police and eventually swarm the hotel where Owen Wilson is staying with his family. He rushes in ahead of the rebels and the rest of the film is Owen and his family on the run, with a little help from Pierce Brosnan who adds a lot as a British agent.

So there is no chance to bond or communicate or understand the culture.

      "text": "Owen Wilson is not the first guy that pops into your head when you think action star but he is not completely unfamiliar with action. He was in a movie called Behind Enemy Lines with Gene Hackman that really could be considered an action movie. Since then Wilson has become more known for comedies, voice over roles and family films. Wilson is good for this role because he is a relatable. No Escape wouldn't work with a big action star. Jack Dwyer (Wilson's character) has something to fight for and he is certainly not invincible, but he will take any risk in order to ensure his family's safety. I think that many people can relate to that. Lake Bell was also great as Annie Dwyer and I think that women could see themselves in her character.",

Owen Wilson did a decent job and I want to see more from him in future action movies. I personally believe that it could've been better.",
