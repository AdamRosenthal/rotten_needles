U:RotL rises above the others (including U:A). The acting by Bill Nighy is just amazing, to his character. In most scenes.. There was something to focus on. In Viktors (Bill Nighys), I couldn't overt my eyes from his character for nothing. Those gazing stares, that amazing accent and the over-all UMF he puts in every one of his scenes, was simply awesome. Micheal Sheen held the second best character of Lucian. His acting was flawless as well. You could really tell he put his heart into it, as well as Bill Nighy. Both set the stage for an awesome flick for those die-hard fans of the UW saga. And last but not the least, Rhona Mitra as Sonja was great. She held the character well and did her part to make this an epic addition to the UW series. A must watch and definite see on Blu-Ray!",

Nothing new for Lycans, however, Martin Sheen's performance look pretty good, I might say.

The change in setting and time period actually help with the return of menacingly good villain Bill Nighy. The loss of Kate Beckinsale can only be seen as a positive (although she does bookend the film) with a prequel story which knows how to have fun. Rise of the Lycans doesn't take itself seriously which is one of the main reasons its enjoyable. However they have gone from one wooden female lead to another with Rhona Mitra's Sonja being just as useless and tiresome as Beckinsale's Selene. While bringing back Michael Sheen and making it an origins story does add a certain gravitas, it fails to wow or at least entertain mainly due to its clearly reduced budget, wooden female lead and depressingly bleak design. Not awful but nowhere near great.",
