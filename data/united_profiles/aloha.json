There's no denying that writer/director Cameron Crowe has a wonderful way with words, but his focus is scattered. The story is sometimes confusing and the action sometimes seems unmotivated. What's undeniable is that every performance is terrific: the characters are engaging and there's dynamic energy between all of the actors. The film starts out with a snappy attitude and plenty of promise, but the screenplay gets lost and ultimately turns mushy (that last scene especially).",

For white people on a base in Hawii, it might be like that, that may be their experience.  The point of the movie is not to be a documentary about how great Hawaii is.

Gilcrest tries to get back together with his ex-girlfriend Tracy (Rachel McAdams) she is married and has children also she is dealing with her silent husband Woody (John Krasinki) whom he is jealous of Brian.

Bill Murray was wasted in the film; he looks bored and has nothing to do in the movie. Writer-director Cameron Crowe manages to screw up the cast and not mentioning Crowe\u2019s insubstantial writing, the romance in the film is not that strong.

      "text": "Aloha is directed by Cameron Crowe and stars Bradley Cooper, Emma Stone and Rachel McAdams as well as other stars like Bill Murray, Danny McBride and Alec Baldwin in the supporting cast. In this film Brian Gilcrest (Cooper), a military contractor returns to Hawaii, a place where a significant amount of his life occurred. There he meets an ex-girlfriend (McAdams) who he begins to reconnect with and he begins to fall for a young Air Force captain (Stone) who was chosen to watch over him. There are also a lot a sub-plots that take away from this overall story, there is also a blessing and another story about rockets being launched. Cameron Crowe has done a great job in the past with blending romantic comedy with other genres. With Jerry Maguire it was sports and with Almost Famous it was music and with Aloha he appears to want to do so with the military. Sadly this film fails to impress and it is a fairly disappointing effort from an excellent cast and director. Every romantic comedy needs a likeable couple that the audience can love and Aloha does not have that. Bradley Cooper and Emma Stone are two huge Hollywood stars that are at the peak of their career but it is apparent from the outset that these two actors do not have the chemistry that it takes. The story also doesn\u2019t really give the pair time to get acquainted with each other and the romance is spawned out of the blue. Emma Stone is a really hyperactive character to the point that she doesn\u2019t even feel believable at times and it seems like there is no spark between the two. In the beginning of the film Bradley Cooper\u2019s character dislikes Emma Stone\u2019s character and nothing really significant happens to change that before the romance begins. Rachel McAdams only seems to be in this movie in order to create a love triangle and even that is weak. I\u2019m not going to say that any of these actors gave a bad performance its just that they weren\u2019t meant to work together. Aloha is also clogged with a bunch of other stories involving Bradley Cooper\u2019s job and I just didn\u2019t care about it. There is no flow at all from scene to scence and the film is moving from stupid story to stupid story and none of the scenes appear to have much relation. The sub-plot about the rockets is just so ridiculous and uninteresting that Bill Murray couldn\u2019t even save it. Bill Murray is painfully underused in this movie as well and the trailers sold him a wise man who appeared to have a significant impact on Cooper\u2019s personal life and that just doesn\u2019t happen and I was really disappointed about that. Then to top it all off the movie isn\u2019t even funny, I did not laugh at all. Aloha was a major let down and this flow hit hard for me because I am such a huge fan of Almost Famous it is one of my favorite films. I still have confidence that Cameron Crowe can still revolutionize films and I will be checking out his next film. I think he just bit off way more than he could chew in this movie.",
