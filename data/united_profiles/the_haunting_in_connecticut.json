The movie plays up the based on the true story angle but if you watch the special features on the DVD you learn that the vast majority of this movie is fiction.  The biggest example being the burning of the home at the end.  It never burned down... ever, yet the end of the movie says that the house was \" rebuilt and resold\".  Somebody does live in it now but it never burned to the ground or had the dead no decomposed bodies built into the walls.  So taking that in to effect we see that the movie isn't really based on the true story making it just another cookie cutter haunted house film full of predictable jump scares.

I think the reason behind it being so forgettable is pretty simple: the film relied almost 100% on jump scares and so once you've scared the crap out of the person sitting next to you by unexpectedly jumping out of your seat and perhaps needing a quick underwear change, you pretty much instantly forget that moment where something big and scary was loudly thrust into your face. A phrase that could quite easily be misinterpreted...anyway! On the whole, it was okay. Although it was, in a way, pretty inevitable I did find the ending quite disappointing. This film was in no way subtle or clever enough to really scare me and stick in my mind, hence the fairly low score. But it was relatively entertaining, it wasn't a monumental waste of time and it would be a fairly decent choice with a few friends over.",
