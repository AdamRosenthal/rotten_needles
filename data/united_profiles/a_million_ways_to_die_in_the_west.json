From the first time I knew it's MacFarlene movie, I didn't expect it will be a very serious comedy movie, I bet it's not even far from the full of instant jokes from Peter Griffin/ Family Guy. So, some critic reviews which disappointed with the movie, I believe they're not true fans of Family Guy at all. I enjoyed the movie. I laughed from the beginning to the end. Well, so many scenes that awkward and not good, I agree. But, I also love the characters relationship has being build up, my opinion is Seth MacFarlene made it, to deliver the movie he wants to make...

I had a lot of fun watching it, because I went in not expecting too much from it, just as I did with Ted. MacFarlane definitely has his moments in this. However, there were a few times when watching him that made me miss him as the foulmouthed teddy bear in his previous film. The supporting cast also did well for the most part. Giovanni Ribisi was pretty funny as usual. Charlize Theron also provided some funny moments. Sarah Silverman felt a bit underwhelming, as did Amanda Seyfried. Neil Patrick Harris's stereotypical gentleman character managed to make me laugh (and his crazy mustache.) And lastly, Liam Neeson unfortunately also felt underwhelming as the villain. One thing I also enjoyed was a few unexpected cameos throughout as well as at the very end. Overall, it's a step down from Ted, but it still made me laugh out loud several times, and at the end of the day, that's all I really care about.",

There are a few jokes but not enough to the point where I could recommend this movie. This is disappointing because Seth McFarlene was written some great stuff such as Family Guy and Ted. The trailer was so alive and full of energy and outside of maybe one or two scenes I rarely got that. Instead I got a dumb comedy that at times was bad with a generic story that doesn\u2019t lend itself well to satire and paper thin characters that aren\u2019t interesting and don\u2019t lend themselves to many jokes. I\u2019m not going to sit here and tell you not to see it because film is subjective and comedy is really subjective as my Dad liked the film and my younger brother loved it. So if you are pumped for this film go and see it. However, unless you are a die hard McFarlene fan I\u2019d recommend waiting until it comes out on DVD. Go spend/save your money as there are a lot of films out there, which look a lot better than this one like X-Men Days of Future Past and most recently How to Train Your Dragon 2. If you do choose to go see this film in theaters and you aren\u2019t a McFarlene fan I only have one piece of advice, which is to lower your expectations.",

MacFarlane plays Albert, a sheep farmer, who has a reputation for being a coward. After backing out of one duel, he is forced into another, after falling for a woman he didn't know was married to a psychopath. With Seth MacFarlane, you know there is going to a range of comedy from ingenious to low-brow, but this recent film is completely the latter. It is impressive that he got such a large cast to star beside him, but unfortunately they all have very little comedic experience and it shows. Writing, Directing, Casting, and Starring in a film is an admirable feat, but it is completely wasted when the film is a stupid as this one. If your film is going to be rated R, why not go all the way with it? If you take out the sheep fornicating and the fowl language, A Million Ways To Die In The West, is nothing more than an awful kids movie, full of potty jokes, and misleading heroes. The story here is very simplistic and half the time it's not even funny. The parts that are meant to be humerus, turn out to be little more than jokes for the young teens that watch Family Guy. When I saw this film, I was hoping for another unique MacFarlane comedy, like Ted. That film was hilarious and extremely unique. By comparison, A Million Ways To Die In The West is about fifteen minutes of content, and an hour an half of complete and utter nonsense. I suspect some of the big stars in this cast wish they could remove this film from their IMDB page, because it really was that bad.",

Now i didn't see Ted in theaters but i ended up laughing quite a bit when i finally got around to seeing it so i thought that id give it this a watch because the trailers looked funny but the movie was just awful and a waste of time. What's even worse is that the movie ruins its all star cast with having Seth MacFarlane take the acting lead for the first time and he fails miserably. I'm saying this right now no one should ever compare this with Mel Brook's western comedy classic \"Blazing Saddles\" because this film is complete garbage on every level compared to that movie.",

A couple of the cameos were nice surprises, and Charlize Theron held her own in showing her comedic abilities, but many of the film's jokes felt forced and somewhat pretentious. Macfarlane seemed far too interested in forcing his outrageous-for-the-sake-of-being-outrageous jokes onto the audience, practicing almost no true wit or any hint of subtlety. The majority of the lazy attempts at humor fell flat, and seemed to come off more-so as desperation. Edgy humor has been and can be pulled off with much more grace. Macfarlane instead relies too heavily on simply blurting out the first thing to come to mind, no matter how half-baked a joke it may be, and flashes that all-too-aware grin while pretty much staring directly into the camera, somehow thinking that is enough to sell anything he says. Overall, he only came off resembling a child who yells and breaks his  crayons when he is trying to get a rise out of his parents. If he weren't so focused on his tries to upstage every other person in the film by attempting to show off the mountains of wit he appears to be under the delusion of possessing, this might have been a halfway decent comedy. The landscape and many of the Western set pieces were beautiful, but otherwise, this film is largely a waste of the much more interesting supporting actors it contained (with Theron and Neil Patrick Harris, in particular, actually trying to do something different with their characters).

Charlize Theron  is a good actress but i really get the sense that she is not suited to comedy and Liam Neeson is really wasted. still a good laugh in parts and I'd take it over all the adam sandler comedies. plus the Christopher Lloyd cameo is worth the price of admission",

Sadly this film is a half-ass attempt at a pastiche. It is quite evident Seth MacFarlane is a fan of Westerns given his references to the great films of the past however his humour creates a lacklustre and albeit apathetic plot.",
