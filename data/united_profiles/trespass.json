It is really the last thing either Kidman or Cage needed, but they got it. The screenplay is atrocious, with so many twists and turns it makes you sick. None of it is original - don't be fooled. The film goes for quantity instead of quality, hence the attempt to look \"smart\" while shifting plot lines like it's no one's business. Nicholas Cage (whom I usually take to be a rather good actor) is simply horrid, as is pretty much everyone else in the cast. I love Nicole Kidman, but she just ended up screaming and giving scared looks throughout most of the film. Then again, she couldn't do much with such thinly written characters. She at least looked stunningly beautiful, and it was rather nice to see her lips be regular shape and volume again, after much fuss over her face and plastic surgery/botox stuff. But, to get back to the point - Trespass is stunningly annoying, with horrible, cheesy dialogue, unnecessary and improbable plot changes, and lame editing. Overall, I would not pay even the \"On-Demand\" price for it, since it's not worth it. To be honest, though, I never expected much from the director of \"Batman Forever\" in the first place, so I'm not even surprised.",

It's a hostage-at-house movie, where the family members & the goons are all hiding something from each other. Nicolas Cage is a diamond agent, with a huge mansion for his wife Nicole Kidman to sit around alone, as her husband is out of town making money and her teenage daughter is out partying. One of those rare days, when the whole family is home, becomes far from pleasant, when a gang of masked people barge into their house, taking the family hostage. Though the gang seem to have a lot of information about Nicolas & his family, the heist doesn't go as planned as people start revealing head-spinning secrets one by one.

Teaming up with famed Director Joel Schumacher and the always intense Nicole Kidman, Cage stars in a type of film we've all seen before. Trespass has a common storyline, but it's done in an unexpected way, with an ending that will leave you speechless. Kyle Miller (Nicholas Cage) is a wealthy diamond merchant, who has finally built the mansion he's always wanted. It has also made him a target for a sophisticated team of thieves, who want their share. Surprised at home one night, the Miller family is held hostage. Positive that if he gives them what he wants his family is dead, Kyle refuses their demands, leading to an epic standoff. Nicholas Cage shows a different side in Trespass, as he's not the cunning hero that saves the day, but rather a family man, trying to protect his family. He's paired with Nicole Kidman, who while being a terrific actress, usually makes films I have no interest in seeing. An action thriller is also something out of the norm for her, but she handled it like a pro and her chemistry with Nicholas Cage was outstanding! Finally, the cast is rounded out by OC star and teen heartthrob Cam Gigandet. I've made it clear that I feel a lot of these \"heartthrobs\" only get jobs because of their looks, and if that's the rule, Gigandet is the exception. Playing both sides in the conflict, the young star does an outstanding job. Gigandet's character is easily the most complex, having to play the good and the bad guy. It's his role and the twist associated with it that makes the whole film rise above similar films like Panic Room. On the surface Trespass is just another copycat, but the story turns out to be far more complex than a home invasion. A unique cast of characters with terrific chemistry, combined with one of my favorite Directors, make for what can only be called a must see movie!",
