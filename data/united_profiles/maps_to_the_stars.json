It's clear why this movie didn't get a 2014 release and why the Academy preferred Moore in Still Alice, since it makes a huge critic to Hollywood, including mentions of names like Demi Lovato, Garry Marshall and even Harvey Weinstein. But I liked how Cronenberg and Wagner explored the politics, fame and behavior of big stars. They're not lying, they're showing something real that many people don't wanna see. Besides the world of movies and celebrities, Maps to the Stars tells a bizarre story about a family and a star who has issues with her abusive dead mother. Mia Wasikowska is also amazing in this surpising movie. I recommend!",
