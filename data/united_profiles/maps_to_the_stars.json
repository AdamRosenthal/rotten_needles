But I liked how Cronenberg and Wagner explored the politics, fame and behavior of big stars. They're not lying, they're showing something real that many people don't wanna see. Besides the world of movies and celebrities, Maps to the Stars tells a bizarre story about a family and a star who has issues with her abusive dead mother.
