I figured the filmmakers would chicken out and make it completely non-sexual as a result of some stupid plot point, but that's absolutely not the case.  P.S. Why is every TV show and movie set in the Hamptons these days?? NY doling out tax credits out that way or something?",

If you've seen Super Bad, The Hangover, Take Me Home Tonight, or any number of copycats, you know exactly what I'm talking about. Granted, the idea here is a little more original than most and the movie does do what it was intended to do, make you laugh. The faces are different, the situation is different, but everything else is exactly the same, there's nothing original here. Jason Sudeikis and Lake Bell do a great job of making us laugh, but again it's just your basic drunken idiots out to do something special, with all the pitfalls, and weird  that happens in-between. It was funny and a great way to kill a couple hours, but I got an extreme sensation of deja vu throughout this film.
