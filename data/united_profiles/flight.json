In this point the protagonist start living in a big contradiction, because he is a national hero, but also an alcoholic. That is why the story moves between two worlds, in one he is a questioned pilot trying to defend his image; and in the other one he is immerse in drugs and liquor failing to acknowledge his problem. This theme of a protagonist facing to worlds is recurrent in the filmography of Robert Zemeckis, for example past versus future in Back to the Future; expectations about the world versus real world in Forrest Gump; and life in the island versus life in the civilization in Cast Away. In the same way of these mentioned pictures, the protagonist of Flight will enter in a rediscovery of himself, to finally become a new person, with no possibilities of returning to what he was before. Despite that the film is slow, Denzel Washington is great and Zemeckis did it again.",

When his son (with whom he established no relationship in the film) showed with a school assignment, I was ready to strangle Zemeckis, Denzel,  and especially the scriptwriter for the most saccharine sappy weepy sell out.

What a waste of money and talent, especially Denzel's. The recovering drug junkie's role was woefully underwritten, and only Goodman in his walk-on role can safely dissociate himself from the rest of the film. The bright spots were the secondary characters, especially  the black stewardess who should have had more screen time and  the dying cancer guy in the hospital.  When I say the film had potential, just imagine a complex, ambiguous film where  Denzel lies at the hearing (without the psychologically and dramatically ridiculous drunken binge the night before), the corporations are punished (as they should for unsafe aircrafts), Denzel retires with a nice severance package that gives him time to first realize that without cocaine he would have not saved the plane and then brings him out of the cycle of self-abuse. He  moves to Jamaica with his white girlfriend.

Most of us have a sense of how corporate and political machines work and we expect cover-ups as an almost routine way of doing business.  Here's the spoiler: instead of taking the route laid out for him by his very bright lawyer, Whip graduates from villein to hero by telling them the unvarnished truth, for which he pays a very steep price but also finds a very a credible redemption. Denzel Washington, a screen idol of heroic proportions, strips away this facade to reveal a character with huge, even fatal flaws in a fearless performance.  The work of John Gatins and Robert Zemeckis in this film is in the realm of pure genius.

This movie is very serious, but still have humorous parts to laugh at.

The direction is satisfying enough to keep the viewers interested in the film i.e. the first 30 minutes of the film show the plane crash which is exceptional, I have never seen something like this before, it was too terrifying and kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the sequence. After those 30 minutes, the 2 hour (almost) drama begins which passes by so quickly, you don't even realize (only if you are a fan of slow-paced drama films). And then, finally the ending, which is downright excellent, I pretty much hoped for an ending like this because without it, the film's message would not have been that clear.

      "text": "\"Flight\" was directed by Robert Zemeckis and stars Denzel Washington, Bruce Greenwood, Don Cheadle and John Goodman. This is a film worth seeing if for no other reason than the first 20 minutes where action and drama take us into the stratosphere of emotion and fear. Written by John Gatins this is the story of an ill fated flight and the alcoholic pilot who despite his addiction, attempts to perform a miracle of aeronautical maneuvering. Not to be understated, Denzel Washington once again proves his wide range as an actor and gives us a performance worthy of his reputation and past accomplishments. Though thin in story line and weak in some other areas (i.e. depth of the  characters etc.) I give the film an 8 stars because, above all else, it was entertaining and certainly gets the viewer involved.",

      "text": "Robert Zemeckis is back to his live action finest with Flight, a film that deconstructs the life of a hero until there is nothing left. Sounds depressing? It kinda is, but like most Zemeckis movies its full of heart. The film tells the story of Whip Whitaker (Denzel Washington), a pilot who saves countless lives when his plane loses control. However when he hits the ground his life is upended by the airlines investigation into the crash and his life, which threatens to reveal his alcoholism. While the film does feel opinionated and at times a little naive (the ending is exceptionally so) it is also one of the most engrossing studies of alcoholism ever devoted to film. Denzel Washington is captivating as Whip, a man like most alcoholics in denial. His commitment to the role is astonishing and there is not a moment in the film you don't  truly believe this character is real, that he would exist in a real world. There isn't a moment in this film where you don't think Denzel deserves all the adulation he has received for this role, its by far his best performance to date. In fact I may be offending Daniel Day Lewis fans when I say that Denzel was by far the more deserving nominee at this years Oscars. Even from the beginning of the film you are captivated by not just the opening sequences but by this character because not only is he broken but hes also charismatic and dare I say it, charming. However the film also soars in its technical aspects as well as the film starts with a pure adrenaline shot as it shows you in full the crash, every little detail. The editing is fantastic but the direction by Zemeckis is what makes it exhilarating. His attention to detail makes the crash tense and genuinely terrifying. The films only action sequence is crafted lovingly and with great skill gripping you to your seat so you just have to watch the rest even if the film settles into a much more serious area of discussion for the remainder. Despite the fact he is supported by some great actors like Don Cheadle and John Goodman, this is Washington's film and Zemeckis shows him at his best. The only downside is the film finds the need to inject some Forrest Gump schmaltz into the film as it draws to a close when it really isn't necessary at all but its to be expected from Zemeckis and it only annoys in the moment as the rest of the film is so good you can't help but remember the many good things over the solitary mistake",

The previews and commercial all focused on the crash and the hero who made an impossible move to land the plane safely, but in reality that's just a small part of the movie. The true focus of the movie is on the troubled life of pilot, Whip Whitaker (Washington), whose demons seem to find him wherever he goes. When he's in the air, Whip is at peace and away from a life of hardship and disappointments, but after the crash, he's unable to fly and has to face that life head on. The film itself was actually a bit slow after the thrilling introduction and the excitement on board the plane. At parts during this film, I was bored, but it's necessary to bring the story together into an unexpected conclusion. Sometimes, a film is slow and it's just not worth it to sit there, but Flight is different. The film may lack something in the middle, but it is well worth you're time. The story is out of this world and Denzel Washington shows that he hasn't lost a thing.

Besides, \"Flight\" could certainly be metaphorical, too, in this story. I'd have liked a less tidy ending.

Great relief he is still excelling in instructing a debatable moral tale with a back-to-his-top-form two-times Oscar-winner Denzel Washington. The narration has its gradual and clock-wise temp in scrutinizing a heroic pilot\u2019s personal quagmire after landing a doomed-to-be-crashed plane with minimum casualty by virtue of his alcoholic addiction (what\u2019s worse is the fact that he was  even when he was at the helm during that dreadful accident). From a legitimate angle, although his valorous action deserves raves from the mass, and the pivotal cause of the accident largely lies in an outdated plane part, he still unavoidably should assume his liability. There is no ambiguity in whether or not he should get away with it, and eventually the case evolves into a self-awakening resolution to reshuffle one\u2019s life from his damned addiction (there is a more-than-enough trek leading into the thematic revelation, thanks to Washington\u2019s instinctive charisma, if falls into other thespian\u2019s palm, which would induce an over-dramatic and self-conscious bravura just to appease the good-over-evil expectation from well-prepared audience. The final twist is histrionic but Danzel\u2019s telling confession is superbly visceral even though has been fermented overlong. The Kelly Reilly tributary also negotiates through an engrossing damsel in mistress plight, until it emerges (a shade bluntly) with the main narrative, prompts the salvation-evoking meeting between a compulsive and recurrent drunkard and an inveterate junkie, it is not a fatalist love story of LEAVING LAS VEGAS (1995, 8/10) although neither of them is another\u2019s messiah. Ms. Reilly, a rather under-used British actress, after many years of endeavor in Hollywood, finally grabs a much meatier role in a mainstream flick and she is never daunted by Washington\u2019s suffocating presence, infuses a secular savor tallies with the formatively square film.  Robert Zemeckis shoots the most matter-of-fact airplane crashing process except the final collision, when CGI unavoidably reveals its tail, but the film stands unyieldingly on its ground as a preachifying morale parable, its motley spectators will never feel being offensive when it tries too much and many cliche settings keep hopping up, anyhow it is a laudable feat from Zemeckis, whom I feel spontaneously send my tip of advice (definitely I\u2019m not a loner here), stopping meddling with the pricey animation gizmos and going back to the fertile soil where germinates FORREST GUMP (1994, 9/10)",

      "text": "Flight was a solid film made with solid precision by director Robert Zemickis; who finally makes his return to live action after a series of experiments with motion capture animation. The movie follows Capt. Whip Whitaker, an alcoholic pilot who save 96 of the 102 souls boarded on a plane that takes a nose dive due to technical failures, He saves them by executing a slick aerobatic maneuver that only a drunk could pull off in the given situation. Make no mistake, this movie was a character study, and a rich character study at that. It bares the devastating consequences of alcoholism and the challenging first step one takes in admitting they are an alcoholic. This study couldn't have been done any better without Denzel Washington, who owns the screen as Capt. Whitaker. The editing (particularly in that eventful crash sequence) was top notch work, without being too showy; and John Gatins' screenplay showed a sharp understanding of the subject matter at hand. This may not be anything too special, but it was way too good; Flight is sure to entertain on all levels.",

Little did I know, it would be a brilliant character study. I don't have many favorite movies, but this is definitely one of my new favorites I can add to that list. All the actors and actresses do a fantastic job. The director did a superb job...one of the great facets of a movie is to feel like you are watching real life and not just a \"movie\". Most movies can't achieve that. But once in awhile, a movie comes along that achieves this accomplishment. This is one of those movies. One of those movies that hits you hard emotionally because of the realism it is able to provoke. Since nowadays movies are just a way to pass time and escape from life, I'm proud to see a movie that challenges our thoughts and feelings on important subjects once again. A movie that makes us look at ourselves and reflect on our own decisions and actions. I hope to continue to see movie studios put out more of these kinds of movies. Movies that will help us understand the complexities of life and ourselves and help us confront them.",

The title of the film is deceiving in that it is more so about the descend (in more ways than one), and the resilience of the human spirit. For the first half-hour or so, \"Flight\" keeps us rapt with thrilling action and a troubling moral quandary. You strap yourself in for the next two hours and prepare to give yourself over to the in-flight entertainment. But after \"Flight\" descends from its high-wire act, the film reshapes itself into a fairly standard story about substance abuse, and the life-long endeavor of maintaining sobriety. Not incredibly entertaining or consistently compelling, but Denzel's Oscar worthy performance alone makes this worth the watch. Denzel does a perfect job giving us just enough to empathize for him but never enough of a reason to condone him either. To Robert Zemeckis credit, he directs a well-crafted film, loosely based on actual events. An interesting character study of a flawed hero we sympathize with throughout despite reoccurring disappointments. This flight reaches it's destination, but I don't think I want to get the round trip. For additional reviews visit: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/member/Nesbitt10",

And Mr. Washington once again proves that he could carry a weak script with his acting ability  and this was by no means a weak script. It felt long only once or twice but that was worth the more than satisfying character interaction. And the plane crash that is the centerpiece of the film was full of intensity and high suspense.

The crash sequence is extremely well handled wringing out maximum tension.  Once grounded, though, the screenplay introduces us to sundry supporting characters that tend to make the story seem very disjointed. Each scene seems to feel like a tiny vignette filling in the background detail of his life which holds little real interest.. The Introduction of drug user Kelly Reilly also doesn't really add the necessary spark. In fact her main purpose is to show that her road to recovery is a lot quicker than the path Denzel's character chooses. The final outcome is somewhat predictable, but before the cloying reunion scenes with the estranged son, there is a really good key scene where bye Denzel is interrogated by a wonderfully understated Melissa Leo. Here the film really packs a punch, but for most of it's excesive running time Flight just doesn't take off.",

It has been about 12 years since we have had a live-action film directed by Robert Zemeckis, director of films such as Forrest Gump and Back to the Future, and he has returned with a triumphant film about substance abuse and lying to ourselves and others around us.  We are given a protagonist named Whit Whittaker, and he is a deeply flawed human being.  I mean he drinks, he uses drugs, and he has lost his family because of it all.  This man really has nothing going for him, and as the film goes on we see Washington dig deep into the role and make this one of the most mesmerizing and sad performances I have seen in a long time.  This movie is that kind of movie that makes you never want to drink alcohol again, similar to films such as Ray or Walk the Line, and it shows a man just go through hell because he has an addiction that he just can't stop.  But I actually felt some pity for this man as well, because we can tell at some level he is a good man and wasn't always like this, in fact he was a great father and great husband from what the movie shows us.  Zemeckis truly snows how to reach the core of his viewers and give them a truly remarkable film.  I will admit that I wish I had seen more of John Goodman's character, and that they could've dug deeper into the stories of some of the passengers on the plane, but these are just small complaints about a fantastic film This movie makes you appreciate your own life and how some things in life might just be an act of God that we can't control.",

In the end, giving it time and consideration, the movie is far from trite and as moving as Washington's past performances.

      "text": "IN MY OPINION **MAY CONTAIN SPOIILERS** by CtheTav This film is not what it seems. I expected to see some kind of action epic based on a plane with a drunken pilot trying to save the day. Apparently the trailers lied. What I saw was a story of a man battling addiction and the overarching story of the culture to blame and compensate that society has become used to. Denzel Washington plays the part of an alcoholic pilot struggling to sober up for an enquiry in to the crash seen in the films trailer. The story is suitably dark and shows the lengths people will go to cover their own asses and place the blame somewhere else without going too far i.e. full blown murder conspiracy. Robert Zermeckis seems to get a lot out of Washington who gives possibly his best performance to date and the film manages to tell the story over a longer time frame without resorting to narration which is always a plus in my opinion. The romance in the film seemed to drag on and I felt it didn't really add to the film and took away from the story. I liked the overall disturbing feeling that the film gives off after watching which is a sure fire sign of some kind of emotional investment. Rating 6 out of 10 A fairly thought provoking experience with rather unnecessary portions",

Flight takes the tor of man who has addiction problem, and add drama, suspense, and a kick-ass plane crash sequence to top it, probably one of the best scenes involving a plane ever.

Denzel\u2019s character was able to gain enough control resulting in the safety of many of the passengers on board. The crash scenario the film portrays acts as only the driving point and set up for the following events. We soon find out the pilot may not be as heroic as the public views him, as information surfaces proving that the pilot was intoxicated. This leads to a very realistic series of events that builds tension and raises questions. Denzel Washington\u2019s performance in Flight was spectacular and the way he unveiled his emotions was perfect. The cast was packed with excellent talent from John Goodman, Don Cheadle, and Bruce Greenwood all of whom played entertaining roles. The soundtrack was different than most dramas, but worked really well with the way it was edited together. My only major gripe with the film is the time taken to introduce characters that in the end didn\u2019t really matter. Flight did an exceptional job of dealing with some heavy content, intense moments and heartfelt scenes. In the end, Flight soared.",
