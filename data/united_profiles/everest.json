On a human level, however, this is a disappointingly underdeveloped affair that comes across as a squandered opportunity more than anything else. This particular story demands and deserves far more of an introspection into the tragedy of that fateful day in May 1996 that killed 12 people; the social issues that surround it; and the immense personal cost to those left behind. The film's screenplay offers little to none of this and the emotion it possesses can be sourced in the remarkable and committed performances of an accomplished ensemble - Josh Brolin, Jason Clarke, Jake Gyllenhaal, Keira Knightley and Emily Watson throw themselves into their respective roles one hundred percent, both physically and emotionally. The acting aside, I feel as though there was a lot more emotion below the surface, waiting to be discovered. It's unfortunate that the film doesn't take the chance to try and find it.",

This one's based on a real expedition that was plagued by harsh weather and other dooming circumstances. The first hour is spent setting up the characters as they prep for the big climb. The 2nd half takes the trek with methodical detail. Even though there are perilous moments, they seldom create much apprehension or drama.

First off, the 3D felt so pointless and didn't invest me any further into the film. Hell, halfway through I pretty much lost interest and didn't really care anymore. Also, the cast felt wasted. For such a great ensemble, everyone's acting was surprisingly mediocre. The middle act felt cluttered and overstuffed with too much happening all at once that it was hard to keep track of all the characters and what was happening to them. And last but not least, the ending was depressing as hell with very little payoff. Yes I understand that these are facts and it was a true story, but that doesn't change the fact that it still put me in a downer mood as I left the theater. Overall, not as near intense as I would've liked and a waste of 3D, talent, and potential. Oh and did I mention that the ending's depressing?",

I was expecting a little more of a mindless action thriller than the amount thematic depth that I actually got, and it was a very memorable and intense ride. Everest dramatizes the 1996 Everest disaster that lead to the deaths of eight people, and the movie involves two groups that get caught in a violent storm while climbing Mount Everest. It actually takes a while to get to the real meat of the story. Maybe 40 minutes pass before the storm is even referenced, but the movie gets so intense and emotional during the last half that it makes up for the slow pacing of the first half. Luckily, the slower first half allows us to get to know each character, their motives to climbing the mountain and each of their backstories. The second half is so much more effective because of this. One thing that bothered me about the film were these random lapses in time that were distracting at times. One moment it would maybe be 2:30 PM, and thirty seconds later, it'll be 5:00 PM. Some of the transitions just felt choppy, but it's not such a big deal that it takes away from the film. Everest is a movie that grabs you and takes your breath away for 2 hours, and it's one that you need to see in the theater.",

It doesn't help much the fact that these characters aren't developed enough, despite the film having enough runtime to do that, but instead, it ultimately focus on its undoubtedly impressive setting and the tension setup. Another thing that bogged the movie itself a little was the lack of narrative heft. Sure, the performances are great (kudos to Josh Brolin, Jason Clake and Jake Gyllenhaal who did an amazing job in this picture), however, as whole, there was not enough narrative terrain to make \"Everest\" reach the landmark of better movies, such as \"Saving Private Ryan\" or \"Life of Pi\".

Everest is the true story of the first men to reach Mount Everest, and their survival in the deep zero cold. First of all, the acting is great, each character shows major emotion and strong feelings that makes their character feel more real. But, why a 7/10 then? Because Everest tired and tried but it felt open ended and unneeded. The writing is rushed, feels like drama class lines. Direction is bare minimum with actors winding about in some scenes.

There were too many people trying to climb the summit on the same day, ladders weren't in place and oxygen tanks were not full or where they were supposed to be.  And, on top of all that, an epic storm blew in and put everyone in extreme jeopardy.  The movie focuses on one group and their guide, New Zealander Rob Hall, and peripherally, another group, led by Jake Gyllenhaal's character.  The movie somehow makes you feel you are there, climbing, freezing, huffing and puffing, and exhausted right along with the climbers.  It all looked very real to me and I couldn't tell what was or wasn't the real Everest, Base Camp and higher up camp areas.  It all looked real to me.

      "text": "\"Everest\"is the true story of the ill fated 1996 expedition by a group of amateur and professional climbers who sought to reach the top of this most difficult of all mountains to ascend. The film stars Jason Clark who portrays Rob Hall, the real life leader of the expedition. Mr. Clark is  ably abetted by Keira Knightley, John Hawkes, Jake Gyllenhaal, Robin Wright, Josh Brolin and Emily Watson. Written by William Nicholson and Simon Beaufoy, the movie was directed by Icelandic director Baltesar  Kormakur whose deft hand and skill help make this 121 minute film move at a very comfortable pace. Of course the real star of the film is Mt. Everest itself for it is the dominance of this natural edifice that controls and ultimately destroys so many who have challenged it. Chronicled in the best seller by Jon Krakauer  (\"Into Thin Air\")  the film plays more like a documentary and its realism is the essence as to why this film is so good. As stated by Mr. Clark's character in the film, these climbers are asked to exist at an altitude level equal to that which 747\u2019s fly. A most amazing feat and one that tests the stamina and sensibilities of both the characters in the film and those in the audience watching it. I give the film an 8.0 with a suggestion that it be seen in 3D for the cinematography and views of the mountain are alone well worth the extra price of admission.",

I never felt truly emotional about the struggles of any of the characters in this film.

There's a pretty big cast in this movie some of which have bigger roles than others, but its a very well performed film. Jason Clarke is without a doubt the star of the film and he probably gives the best performance. Josh Brolin was also very good. Then you have talent like Jake Gyllenhaal, Sam Worthington (who really impressed me) and Kiera Knightley. There is not a huge amount of development in the characters but Brolin and Clarke's characters do get a little which makes the second half of the film work a little better. The film goes through a pretty big shift after about a hour and gets emotional, but not as emotional as it could've been. Then the ending is a bit of a bummer if you are not aware of this story. I did not and the ending was just slightly disappointing.",

All the backstory and conversations didn't really seem necessary to be that long and it felt really boring. But when the part you come into Everest for comes rolling in, everything starts becoming spectacular. The acting was terrific and the sequences were really great. It was pretty intense at times and overall I enjoyed it. Eventually, at the end, I felt like I was really angry because of stupid character choices, but since it's based on a true story, you might as well tell the truph(concussion). I feel really sad about this film but the film is pretty darn good. Side-note: Jake Gyllenhaal was hilarious in this film and the main characters wife was pretty hot. (81/100)",

Would the four fatalities not have happened if he had been with his group?  The book explained it's business; the more clients that reach the summit, the more clients they'll have next year.

Movie however lacks the jargon part in dialogue, we see characters frost bitten but no one mentioned the phenomenon. Also many may be lost on the way to the summit and it would have helped if there was a summary of the main track and major milestones. The best part of the movie is the excitement created with the screenplay and how close it is to the actual events. On performances, Jason clark and Jake Gyllenhal are top notch, Emily watson is perfect in her role. Keira Knightly and Robin Right are reasonable both. Overall a different and exciting experience",
