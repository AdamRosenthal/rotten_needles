As a film of 26 segments can say that there are some good and some bad, but in this movie about 80% of the segments and bad, poorly worked, a waste of money that could is in the hands of several families of Africa and no doubt an attack to good taste.\"The ABCs of Death\" would be better spent on TV with a segment of at least 20 minutes, but the way we see. \"M is for Miscarriage\" anyone with a camera and red dye could repeat that thread and maybe it would be better than what we see on screen (BIG WASTE OF MONEY). \"I is for the Ingrown\" gives us a sense of emptiness, because it explains nothing of what we see on screen. \"G is for Gravity\" is even emptier than the previous one where not even an actor can be seen on the scene (MUCH BETTER SEE A VIDEO ON ANY INTERNET). \"Would be F Fart\" is a violation of horror films like  The Evil Dead  I think this qualifies or segment with a black comedy. \"L is for Libido\" and \"Y is for Young Buck\" come to sound offensive by exposing young people to certain situations. These are examples of segments that do not work or work poorly and we give the impression that a boy twelve years old with a digital camera with the budget that the directors had managed to do something better.More segments are not all bad, bad, or regular. \"D is for the Dogfigth\" and an example of good use of cinematography and gives us the impression that this is not part of the film. The movements are perfect, the plot and clearly understandable, there was a good investment on the part of the director. \"X is for XL\" try conveying a message in the wrong way, but it failed in all one of the few segments that give a dose of suspense. \"V is for vagitus\" should have a movie solo, because the idea could be better crafted. This segment and the second makes us think we're seeing another movie.Well, if you want to laugh a little, have a little fright and feel sick with the twelve and twelve fake blood (because in certain scenes is clearly noticeable that the blood used and false, very false and FALSE) then go to the cinema and watch \"The ABCs of Death\", but have patience, because at times you will say exactly the theme of the segment \"W is for the WTF!\"",

I was interested in watching it because of the many comparison's the film had to one of my favorite horror movies, V/H/S/2. I didn't like the first V/H/S much at all... But, this review isn't about V/H/S, so let's steer away from it. This movie was a total miss for me by the way, in case you didn't pick that up already.",

It's as if the writers and directors simply didn't have enough energy to make an attempt to film anything worthwhile.",

With a running time of about two hours and twenty-six short films to labor through, you'll quickly realize that after just six uninteresting short films, you have to sit through just twenty more, and it gets boring... fast. There are a couple gems in this anthology, but for every good segment, there are five more bad segments. I would hardly call this a horror movie because only  a couple segments are even remotely scary, while the rest are so over-the-top and silly that it would be more appropriate to call this a comedy.
