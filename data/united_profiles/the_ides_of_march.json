The film shows corruption on both sides of the political ideologies. If anything the Republicans got off easier because they weren't even in the movie. Although it is starring George Clooney, he doesn't get much screen time. Every actor did very well. It seemed as if each one got enough screen time. Molly's suicide was very disturbing. Also people may find the topic of abortion to be disturbing. To top-off this review I would like to say, \"We're Catholic\".",

George Clooney and Paul Giamatti did very well as well, but I do believe that Philip Seymour Hoffman was the one who deserves the best acting job in this film- just great. The cast and dialogue is what really put this film together nicely. Here are my criticisms and reasons why I gave the movie a lower score- Before I saw the movie, I read a brief synopsis about what the film was about. I was very interested and excited to find out what sort of \"dirty politics\" were going to be used in it. What I found out to be unfortunately didn't impress me and seemed a bit unrealistic to me. It took a very long time for the \"problem\" and climax to appear in this film as well, so as a result, it seemed to me that the first half of the movie dragged on. My final criticism for this film is the ending. Directors like to leave audiences hanging, yes, but in this film, it just lets you fall off of the cliff, not even knowing what to think. Yes, the ending made me think, but everything (the climax of the film) led up to nothing. It felt under-cooked and disappointing to me.",
