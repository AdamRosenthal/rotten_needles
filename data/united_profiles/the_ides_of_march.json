Evan Rachel Wood was incredibly endearing, and Paul Giamatti did a wonderful job.

George Clooney and Paul Giamatti did very well as well, but I do believe that Philip Seymour Hoffman was the one who deserves the best acting job in this film- just great. The cast and dialogue is what really put this film together nicely. Here are my criticisms and reasons why I gave the movie a lower score- Before I saw the movie, I read a brief synopsis about what the film was about. I was very interested and excited to find out what sort of \"dirty politics\" were going to be used in it. What I found out to be unfortunately didn't impress me and seemed a bit unrealistic to me. It took a very long time for the \"problem\" and climax to appear in this film as well, so as a result, it seemed to me that the first half of the movie dragged on. My final criticism for this film is the ending. Directors like to leave audiences hanging, yes, but in this film, it just lets you fall off of the cliff, not even knowing what to think. Yes, the ending made me think, but everything (the climax of the film) led up to nothing. It felt under-cooked and disappointing to me.",

It would be difficult to chose a stand out as everyone is amazing; Gosling does his typical acting with few words when necessary, Clooney is charismatic and yet feels at times volatile, and Paul Giamatii just feels greasy and sleazy. Credit should also go to the writers as the managed to make a subject i find difficult and slightly boring easy to understand and gripping. i thought at some points the film looked gorgeous when the lighting and cinematography was combined.

Sometimes he makes a great movie, and sometimes he makes a terrible or a dull movie, and this movie is in the middle of all of that. The cast in this movie is out of this world brilliant.
