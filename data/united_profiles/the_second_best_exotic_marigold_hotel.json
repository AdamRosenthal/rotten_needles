Let\u2019s face the fact that it was never going to outdo its first film, but it definitely gives it a valiant attempt. the films strongest asset is the cast even if a few feel wasted and i still think this feels like a tourist board version of India ignoring quite a few of the issues affecting India today. but the charaters are what make this movie as flawed as it sometimes gets theseare enjoyable. Would I describe this film as good?  Probably Yes, I would say it was good, it just wasn\u2019t as good as I wanted it to be!!  What propels the film up is it\u2019s cast and decent performances, I just think it could have been slightly better written. I think, given a bit more time and a few changes to the script , this film could have been great.  I will say, however, if you enjoyed the first film maybe you should go and see it at the cinema.  I would personally recommend you wait for it to come out on DVD though, especially considering that I would rather this film not  be a box office success and encourage the idea of making a third film.
