As a film that could've easily felt out of place in Phase 2; 'Ant Man' fits in well thanks to Pym's past and hilarious references to the Avengers etc., plus the cast are all excellent (particularly Paul Rudd as Scott Lang and Michael Douglas as Hank Pym).

      "text": "Much like everyone else I was pretty doubtful about how this film would turn out. Even after the success of \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" I  was expecting this film to bomb. Much to my surprise though it turned out to be a solid film. It is not groundbreaking as the other films but it is good at what it does. i was nervous about this film since Hank Pym had always been one of my least favorite heroes but they made the smart move of him being a mentor figure and having the spotlight be on Scott Lang. He is the typical reluctant hero with a criminal past and tries to redeem himself. He has a nice relationship with his daughter and has problems with his marriage due to his criminal past. The family is a big component of his character arc but there are still lasting consequences for his past. Even when he saves his daughter he still is divorced and is still living away from his daughter. The relationship he has with Hank is the the typical hero mentor relationship which reminds me of a similar relationship that Mr. Hun and Daniel from the Karate Kid remake had when the mentor learns from the student as well as the student learning from the mentor. His relationship with the future Wasp was also well done as they learn form each other as well as start to grow a fondness for the other. I am interested in seeing how Ant Man would fit into the Avengers and I would love to see Wasp enter the fray in the future battles ahead. The action scenes are fun to watch because they give creative elements to other wise standard action sequences.  Unfortunately there are some problems that keeps this film from being only a good film to a great film. As well as the story line was told, it does rely heavily on cliches. The plot was well told and it did have some genuine surprises such as the time when Ant-Man shrunk so much that he was in another dimension which gives way to a visual spectacular visual set piece. Aside from that though the majority of the story line revolves around the standard tropes of a heist movie. As well developed as the main heroes are, the villain is once again bland. Marvel really needs more villains that stand out aside from Kingpin, Ultron, Loki, and Iron Monger. The side characters are really nothing more than stereotypes which includes a very problematic representation of Latinos in Lang's best friend. It is also strange that Wasp wasn't allowed to be part of the final battle even though it was heavily established that she was a better fighter than Lang. Although I still think this is a good film I did dislike that one aspect of it. It is a good film that could have been a great film if it wasn't tied down by it's reliance on cliches and stereotypes.",

The movie does a poor job of expressing the urgency of preventing Cross from having Ant-Man's power.

All of them play each other in a very engaging manner. What avoided Ant-Man from reaching its full potential was mostly the villain, who was just another evil businessman stereotype, and didn't give the talented Corey Stoll a lot to do. It was basically a recycled version of Iron Man's Obadiah Stane. Bobby Cannavale was underused as well in a very thankless role, and Michael Pe\u00f1a's jokes were contrived and sometimes juvenile and annoying.

Instead, we are left with the most formulaic story Marvel\u2019s ever written that while not bad has been seen before in several Marvel films. If the film had interesting characters like Guardians of the Galaxy or great action like Pacific Rim or The World\u2019s End (seriously great action there) those flaws could be overlooked but unfortunately none of the characters are interesting and the film fails to do anything interesting with the heist premise or take advantage of the shrinking concept to provide creative action and visuals. As a result, Ant-Man comes across the way The Incredible Hulk, Thor, and Captain America come across for some people it just exists to set up another Marvel movie. Similar to The Wolverine, the end credits scene, the second one as the first one reveals something obvious, teases a bigger and more interesting movie and hopefully that makes up for it because if this is the approach Marvel will take to all non-Avengers films going forward then I grow increasingly worried about how they will treat future additions such as Dr. Strange and Spider-Man. Die hard Marvel fans will probably be satisfied with the film as the loud family behind me was but those looking for something special will not find it here just sneak in for the end credits scene, the only good part of the film, and/or wait for the DVD if you are curious.",

It's like when Steve Carrel did \"Foxcatcher\"; you wouldn't expect actors like them to do something very unique. But Rudd pulls it off with flying colors. I could go on about the performances. Michael Douglas is fantastic as \"Hank Pym\", going back and forth with the likes of Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lily (she's also great). And Michael Pena was hysterical! But I want to get into the scope of this movie. It's really narrowed down to such a much smaller scale in comparison to every other marvel movie. And I loved that! The cinematic scope and vision was so perfect for this movie. The action was super cool and inventive all at the same time. It shows that you don't need humongous action sequences like in the \"Avengers\" movies or \"Man of Steel\". It's still rather impressive to watch the action scope unveil on a smaller that level that can still keep your eyes glued to the screen. As for flaws, I didn't care Bobby Cannavale's character. And I wish they went more in depth with the relationship between Scott Lang and his daughter. I felt something was there, but not entirely for me to care about them. I will say that the villain may not have brought anything new to the table, but he was still intriguing to watch unveil. Overall, this is a wildly hilarious and beautiful action movie shown on a much smaller scale. I give \"Ant-Man\" an A-! Be sure to check out my YouTube channel \"LittleMovieBoy\" for more reviews. Hopefully this review will be up by tomorrow.",

As expected jokes feel like a focus in this film but they don't forget about action, Parts of the film slow down a bit when story becomes a focus and it seemed difficult for them to find a good balance of the two. When the action does break out it is very entertaining, Seeing Ant-Man shrink and grow as he takes out a room full of guards is a sight to see and the end fight is insanely intense and comedic at the same time. There is also a few small ties to the rest of the Marvel Universe and it's characters  witch is nice to see.There isn't much else to Ant-Man, Its a fairly straight forward concept that any Marvel/Super Hero fan will enjoy for sure.It would have been nice to see Edgar Wright direct the film but It still turned out OK.",

The editing is slightly affected by two obvious jump scenes in the beginning of the film and the emotional engagement of the characters is slightly rushing but given the limited 2 hours running time, the progression of the plot is rather fine linking to MCU by covering the background, science, encounter, relationship between characters and mission to fight the villain. Paul Rudd leads a charming performance as Antman, Michael Douglas and Evangeline Lilly also offer some surprise as supporting casts while Corey Stoll as the antagonist is a bit underdeveloped. The CGI and action sequences are at a smaller scale, the shrinking cinematography is outstanding together with scores composed by Christophe Beck but being a less darker superhero film, Marvel has once again delivered successfully.",

The reason I am not giving it a solid 10 is because people talked so fast and the plot moved so quickly in a few sections that I missed some minor yet pivotal details. Still, I got the gist of it and the producers did a bang up job making Ant-Man cool. Fair warning, there is a bit of swearing for a PG-13 film. Which is awesome.",

Like other movies where shrinking is involved, this one makes use of insects--either the shunken hero riding them or commanding them. The movie has many moments and at times quite funny.  But the science in this sci-fi flick is very flimsy. Maybe not enough to bother the casual viewer, but for a nerd like me it did.  They could have left out the part (or done it better) where the villain explains how the shinking process works (it shrinks the distances between atoms, but mass remains the same). This explanation is completely ignored afterward since Antman's mass clearly changed--for example he can ride a winged ant and that ant can carry him easily in flight. That should be impossible if his shunken mass was the same as his normal mass.  And then we have the whole \"going subatomic\" thing. If what the suit does is SHRINK the DISTANCE BETWEEN ATOMS how can it make the wearer shrink SMALLER THAN AN ATOM?  I felt a better thought out explanation of the shrinking process (and what precisely happens to one's mass) should have been included.  But other than that flaw, it was an entertaining film and quite different in many ways from Marvel's other superhero films.",

This film is funny, smart, action packed, and proves that Marvel can still create new and exciting films. Paul Rudd as Scott Lang was perfect casting and made me forget any worries I had about Hank not being Ant-Man. Besides Rudd, Micheal Douglas and Evangiline Lilly are great as Hank Pym and his daughter, Hope. Corey Stoll as Darren Cross/Yellowjacket isn't as bad as some critics are saying, and he brings a true motive and terror to his role. I believe the true comedic star of the film is Michael Pe\u00f1a who plays Luis, Scott's best friend. He steals every scene he is in and I want him in more Marvel films, he's a real treat. This movie pulls off the heist genre, a tough genre to do, while maintaining the campy comic book feel we've come to know and love. There's many surprises for fans during and even after the movie. Overall, Ant-Man is some of the most fun I've had at a theater, and definitely in Marvel's top 5.",

Fortunately, Ant-Man dared to be different than the usual superhero flick like the largely overrated Avengers and abysmal Man of Steel by being a heist movie. Ant-Man, based on the Marvel character, Scott Lang has to use Dr. Pym's Ant-Man suit and plot a heist to stop Darren Cross from making more Ant-Man suits. The suit itself allows the wearer to shrink to the size of an ant while their physical strength increases, making them a virtually unstoppable force. The worst thing I can say about Ant-Man is that it's not as neat and controlled as Marvel's best entries. It doesn't match the tight story of Iron Man or the thrilling nature of Captain America: The Winter Soldier, but it makes up for that by being an incredibly fun and sometimes unpredictable heist movie. A majority of the film is dedicated to showing how Lang attempts to pull of the heist rather than showing non-stop action. It makes Ant-Man feel unique and significantly different than any other Marvel movie I've seen. Most of the action doesn't happen until the final act of the film, but the scenes themselves are very interesting since you see Lang and Cross constantly growing and shrinking. There's also quite a bit of comedy in there, which unfortunately, misses a lot more than it hits. Nevertheless, Ant-Man is an appropriately fun and unique superhero movie that actually tries to tell a story rather than showing fifty skyscrapers fall to the ground.",

Scott lang is just a man who is a deadbeat dad in and out of jail trying to do right by his daughter Cassie. the film was ,for me at least, split into two halves with the first half being an origin story and the second a more fast paced funny action packed adventure, the film was a lot of fun and i would recommend it to any marvel or superhero fan",

With the reliance on action taking a back seat the writing is the star here and Ant-Man has a wonderfully knowing and smart script which gives all the characters room to breath and their own moment in the spotlight. Rudd is perfect as the reluctant hero, and its good to see Michael Douglas back in a meaty role. When the action does arrive it is done in a way different to what Marvel has done before, almost making fun of its big budget predecessors. All the set pieces that reoccur in the other films are still here, but they are given a twist that will leave you with a massive grin on your face, especially if you are fed up with the standard Marvel trope of destroying a city at the conclusion of every film, which happens here too but in a very different way. Also it has the best use of Thomas The Tank Engine in any film you will have seen to date.

But the comics adds a layer of despair that the film glosses over in order to make a more fun summer film. There's nothing wrong with this, but a pop-music movie can only earn so many points in my eyes. For the extra points, they really have to reach for some emotional truth.

Let me just make it clear here that I do not use the same criteria for all movie genres. Superhero movies get lower criteria in terms of acting, story credibility, character development. There are always dumb aspects of story in such movies, however they make up for such deficiencies in spectacular scenes and entertainment. For many of us, the main value is just bringing our favorite comic book characters to life. Many people are wrong to overcriticize superhero movies. They are not supposed to give us deep, believable stories, with elaborate character development. They are made to entertain and to amaze our visual and audio senses, not to produce strong emotions, or to stimulate deep thought. That being said, the story, the script should make some sense, and they should be somewhat consistent, with witty and funny dialogue. This one fails at that . First, they try to give it some scientific credibility, and they they totally disregard their own initial setting of the scientific premises. At first, upon shrinking the Antman does have the same mass and produces somewhat appropriate physical effects as he engages the world, and then they totally forget about it, and they let Michael Douglas carry a shrunk tank in his pocket. They should have made up their minds right at the beginning to either disregard the science or to stick to it. They cannot have both in the same movie. This is just one example of the issue, and the whole thing just doesn't work. Now, all of this should not be a big problem. You just forget about this movie and the time you just wasted, but this thing is going to spread to the Avengers series (it already did with it's references and appearance of Falcon and the Avengers base), and that worries me. This is going to contaminate the Avengers series, which so far was quite good, again given the genre.",

I don't know how the story in the comic was, but I can tell you this, Ant-Man is the perfect character for the big screen. The special effects are nothing short of magic and take the concepts of Honey, I Shrunk The Kids to a whole other level. Scientist Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) created a new technology, one that was so dangerous, he buried the research deep in his company archives, but when his successor comes across it years later, he develops it, despite warning from Pym. In order to stop this from getting out, Pym recruits an unlikely hero to help him, Scott Lang (Paul Rudd). Lang is one of the best burglars around and Pym hopes to use these unique skills to get back his work. The only thing is the company's lab is impenetrable to all, except bugs. Using his prototype, Lang becomes Ant-Man and that is when this film really gets fun. Paul Rudd is absolutely terrific in this movie, as a small, nerdy, awkward guy, he can be hysterical under the right circumstances and this was just the perfect role for his personality. Rudd is paired with Michael Douglas, who 10 years ago wouldn't have even considered doing a film like this, showing just how powerful and influential the Marvel brand has become. Out of all the Marvel films to date this is perhaps the most interesting one. The cast is amazing, the special effects are outstanding, and I may never see Thomas The Train in the same way again. If you're like me, and not crazy about superheroes, don't let that stop you from seeing this film. Ant-Man has a little bit of everything and goes way beyond anything I would have ever expected to see in film based on a comic book.",

I'm not against action; I enjoyed Spectre and Force Awakens and other superhero movies such as Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 2 and the first Avengers movie, but there was nothing like the entertaining relationships of Avengers or Spider-Man in this film, and somehow the personal story (which revolved around Ant Man's desire to see his daughter, which his ex-wife wouldn't let him do because he hadn't paid child support which he had not been able to do because he'd just gotten out of prison) and its connection to the action wasn't convincing to me. It may have had to do with the lead not having adequate charisma or chemistry with anyone. It really just all came across to me as a bunch of noise. I think the musical score should have been a lot better too. It came across as generically bombastic. One bright spot was Michael Douglas, especially the way they made Michael Douglas in the first scene, which takes place in the past, appear so young. That was a fun bit that lasted a few minutes.",

You can see him easily see-able small enough on a play table, but seemingly smaller within an anthill. None the less, the visual effects are effective and just cool. Another thing with this movie is its non-canonness. \"Ant-Man\" in his original comic was also able to become a \"Giant-Man\". I guess the reason they scrapped this idea was to make it seem like a \"covert operation\", rather than a full scale offensive against a threat to the Avengers/ a threat against the populace. I guess they are going to have him be a \"covert operation assistant\" for the Avengers, rather than a full-scale offensive specialist. Overall, I'd give this movie a 9/10.

Now Ant-Man is very funny thanks to Paul Rudd, but the jokes seem to overtake the action that takes place in the film, even the hilarious jokes from Micheal Pena were very funny, the humor may flood the action, but you just can't take your eyes off of the amazing 3D CGI that Marvel Studios used in the film because it pops out so much that it look really real. The CGI might as well be the best thing about this film other than the great humor. Another thing that was great was the fact that the film wasn't overly long like other films made by Marvel, but that was probably another problem, you see there really wasn't enough story to really make a connection to the comics, clearly the film starts off before Hank Pym gives up being Ant-Man, then Scott Lang gets out of prison and becomes Ant-Man, then it really takes a good leap farther into the comics while not staying in order for more understanding. Ant-Man really goes somewhere and make another good superhero movie from Marvel, but Ant-Man has more to prove to movie goers.",

It semi-delivered on this expectation, enough that it felt kind of fresh and made me wish other standalone hero movies were equally entertaining (that is, about 23% more entertaining). The pacing is good in the first half and rushed in the second, which may be a consequence of the rewrites, who knows. Plenty goes unexplained but the pieces fit together nicely enough, a snug click but not an exciting clack. Michael Douglas beats the toy train for Official Highlight of the Film. Hank Pym has been conspicuously absence from the new Marvel movieland and I\u2019d rather watch him ferreting around in a lab coat and telling people they\u2019re full of **** for two hours than see another scientist fight his own ego while wearing a Mega Man suit.

Get rid of Thomas and the final fight is just Ant-Man running from lasers.  The plot is decent though. When I go see a Marvel movie I expect fantastic action and a little bit of humor, however Ant-Man was a whole lot of humor and terrible action.

You have won over a herd of mindless zombies to watch and praise your movies no matter what garbage comes out.  Oh, boy! I am excited to see the sequel of this movie later on in  the future ( ** the mind of an MCU fanboy**)",

The writing, the action, the cinematography, the casting, the performances, and music are all really good throughout the movie. The movie also has some really great comedy which is what ultimately makes Ant-Man as a movie character work so well.",
