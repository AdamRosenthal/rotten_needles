A nice and enjoyable slice of life film, it is a captivating character study of a self-destructive, immature young man who desperately needs to grow up. Anna Kendrick perfectly emulates this type of person here, while Joe Swanberg and Melanie Lynskey also turn in good performances. The writing and direction here are solid and the film has good pacing with an interesting story to tell. I love slice of life films and this is no exception, though it does feel a touch incomplete. It needed to be longer than 82 minutes, just to give these characters more depth and more time to do things. Unfortunately, that is not the case and I would point to that as the film's main weakness. Otherwise, however, it is an enjoyable dramedy with good acting and compelling characters.",

Amazing, really.  But that's about all there is good to say about this film.  The unredeemable problem with Happy Christmas is that the screenplay presents a protagonist who is utterly unlikable, and is paired with a best friend who is equally unlikeable.  The storyline is just a train wreck.  Depressing?  Yes.  Interesting or mildly important commentary on humanity?  I'm afraid not.  I was disappointed tin this screenplay.  Perhaps it could have worked as a 15 minute short.  I hoped to see Kendrick charm us in this role, and to the extent possible I think she does.  The problem is that the character - and film as written - just doesn't charm.",
