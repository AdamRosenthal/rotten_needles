The lighting is well done, the editing is snappy, the soundtrack is nothing short of epic, and the pure amount of extra participation is unprecedented. However, this movie is an absolute nightmare for anyone that is host to parties. I had anxiety from the start of the party to the moment the credits rolled. The only major problem with the film is the almost complete disregard for consequences. Putting text at the end will not discourage an over zealous viewer from throwing their own Project X. Even the father completely disregards his sons blatant disregard for authority. With all that being said I rate this right in the middle of the sliding scale.

What I mean by that is that while you are watching this, due to the badly fleshed out characters, lacking story development, and the overall style of the movie... you feel like your a third wheel watching it, it feels as if you are watching a bunch of OTHER people have fun and your just sadly stuck in your theatre seat.  What else does it do wrong?  It's just not funny, aside from two parts, the jokes are just for shock value with no build up OR punch line, so it feels like a very bad episode of Tosh.0 without the clever commentary.  Also, the characters are both unbelievable and unlikable, especially the main character's best friend in the movie.  Some may say though that at least its entertaining.. but how?  At first in the movie, it does sort of lift the mood by its loud pump music and outrageous party footage, but the movie followed this formula too much to the tee.  The movie was 10 minutes of party montage with loud music and 4minutes of irrelevant dialogue; repeat.  The Good:  There is None.  The Bad:  The movie fails at connecting to the audience, lacks funny jokes, and unbelievable and unlikable characters.  So why get the 1?  Despite all the \"hating\" upon this movie, it does serve a good purpose.  This would be a perfect movie to play in the background of a drinking party, just make sure your party goers are hammered, cause thats the only audience this movie should attract.",

I do not think it is the greatest movie by any means nor is it anything special in the way other comedies have been of this ilk.  I was entertained though.  Of course I am a guy, and the breasts did add to the overall likeability of Project X.  I will admit that much, but I found the ride fun and the knowledge of what was to come enticing to see.  I wanted to see the craziness to keep going.  I needed to see the total chaos that I saw in the sneak previews.  The spoiler was in my head and that made me want to go through it and not think about how bad the acting was or how the director didn't care to really care fill the screen with thought provoking dialogue.  The movie was meant to take our inner child that tells us to let go and have fun, and take it for a ride.  My party days are long gone, and I do not think about it at all nor do I really miss it. Yet, it was nice to see what it would be like if I could turn back the clock and just totally immerse myself in that moment.

      "text": "O.k. So three complete morons through a \"party\", which apparently in some suburban neighborhoods is roughly equivalent to a barbarian raiding. In the process of \"partying\" they destroy one their parent's houses, part of their neighborhood, started several dozen fires, destroyed their car, and likely killed one or more people. In the end, one ends up riding the \"short bus\" to school after being declared \"mentally deficient\" to avoid prosecution, one had nothing happen to him but has several paternity suits filed against him, and one got a few months. The one with several paternity suits brags about \"his next 'party'\" on national television. So the moral of the story: destroy, rape, pillage, murder, no one else's lives matter, so long as you have fun and in the end everything will be okay. Ultimately, the only way this vaunt through sociopathy could have been construed as a comedy would have been if it ended in a Tarantino-style battle royal which left everyone of the psychotic main characters laying dead in a pool of their own blood. That didn't happen, this wasn't funny.",

Thomas is a complete coward who is pushed around by his disgusting, obnoxious, loser \"friend\" Costa.  They both hang out with J.B. who is only there so Costa can constantly insult him about his weight and are followed around by Dax,, who records the party on his camera.  The entire dialogue consists mostly of Costa talking about how \"epic\" the party is and how popular it will make them.  Every \"joke\" is signaled by Costa yelling \"What the **** is that!?!\" or \"What the **** are you doing?!\"  It's almost as if they asked a 14 year old to write what they think a party is like.  A little person punching kids in the groin is about as sophisticated as the humor in this movie gets.  To me, the most insulting part was how they completely villainize anyone who wants to shut down their party. Absolute garbage.",

My entire reaction to Project X was, \"This is lame, man. Really lame.\" If only this film were an affront to decency. I wish it were offensive. If only it were the slightest bit funny. There's no real story. Once you've seen five minutes of it, you've seen all it has to offer. It isn't half as wild and crazy as it pretends to be.

The cinematography and use of flip cams was awesome and really well done. The only reason why i wont dismiss this film as bad, is how true it is and accurately it portrays a big portion of high school teens. I myself am a senior in high school and can say, the script accurately shows how we talk and the party shows the way we act. the only part i was iffy on was the instant consumption of about 70 ecstasy pills, that i feel would have been met with more hesitation.

Though it's not a good outlook or a good influence for the matter, it creates some fun that has no real value at all.

If you go into this movie with \"Godfather-like standards\", I'll call them, then of course you will hate it. But, if you see this movie just to have a good time on a Friday night with some of your buddies, I guarantee you will like this movie.",

So, when I decided to watch it, I was expecting the movie to be something just \"wow\". But it really wasn't.",

The reason i saw this movie is cause i want to see a movie that no one has ever done before! and Project X is perfect example. The second reason i thought this movie was gonna be great is because Todd Phillips the director of 'The Hangover' is producing this film. this movie is about  a terrible friend/perv Costa (Oliver Cooper........who looks like Shia LeBouf's stunt double) tries to a good deed by throwing a massive party for his friend Thomas, by doing terrible things such as  drugs, sex and crazy stuff. This isn't a good movie it's a **** insane and spectacular movie! But this movie is making a bad example for teenagers. My Grade A-",

      "text": "By the way, I'd like to give this movie a 6. However, Metacritic defines that score in movies as positive. I wanted to keep my opinion as mixed, so it had to be a 5. It's annoying. Let's get to the review, though. I honestly don't even know what to call Project X (PX). Is it a movie? A hidden message? An encourager? Regardless of what is defined as, it's not a very good movie. I went in my recordings to watch it expecting a comedy. While the film starts off like that, it's takes a different, disappointing turn later on, but we'll talk about that later. PX is actually a fairly good comedy starting off, even though the plot and dialogue were simple. The characters in this movie are mediocre, though. You most likely won't care about them. Then again, PX doesn't really try to be a real movie. It's not deep, and there's no way in hell it's getting any type of awards. It's just made for you to have fun. Judging it as a movie though, it's slightly good at best, and pitiful at worst. I went in expecting a real movie, too, which I probably shouldn't have done. Like I said, as a movie, it starts off fairly funny. Then it gets to the party. I can see it being entertaining with some of my friends over, but by myself, it got boring as it went on. Sure, you have some good laughs during the party, but all I was really seeing was just a bunch of old teens dancing, drinking, fighting, and all the other stuff you'd expect out of a party like this. I did like the third act when destruction hits and the whole neighborhood and party gets totally f*cked up. If you're going in PX expecting a stupid, fun flick, you're most likely going to be entertained. However, I regret the decision expecting I was gonna get an actual movie because the results weren't what I wanted.",
