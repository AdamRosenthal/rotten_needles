I mean, I understand it's a remake, but changing 3 things about it is not enough. You need to change a lot about it, and not make viewers think that they're watching the original. Secondly, the actors just give up on acting. Sam Rockwell tries so hard, but his acting just doesn't work for the film. The wife can't even act, and the kids sound like they're reading the script for the first time. The directing is less than average, and I'm surprised a studio like 20th Century Fox would even supervise this film. Making the same film that came out 20 years ago, just with flat-screens, is not OK. Third, the film just isn't scary. I am always scared during horror films, but the only part I was scared at was the clown scene. Finally, you shouldn't waste your money on this film. You will be as disappointed as me and the other reviewers are. It is a waste of time, and you'll be sleeping more than watching the film.",

Director Gil Kenan's direction is just slick if his visuals were close to Hooper's vision could made it work. Since Sam Raimi produced the film, I thought this movie was going to be gruesome but the movie is bland and if this was \"bloodier\" then it might of been fun to watch.The acting was good, the cgi was impressive but watch the original series. Positives: the film is scary and it's entertaining, the film was watch able it tries to be a cheesy B+ movie like in the original, but if you have good screenwriters and a proper director this might have been good. Let's talk about the closet what makes that scene good is it is mysterious and does show that under world in this modern remake it does show the world in a good way.

      "text": "Poltergeist is a remake of the 1982 film of the same name. I didn't have high hopes for this film from the beginning because Steven Spielberg is not involved after having a significant impact on the first film. I don't think anyone was asking for this movie because even the original film has grown old and doesn't seem as relevant as other horror films that are considered \"classic\". The 2015 version relies too much on the original and does not try to create its own legacy. Many scenes in the film are almost exactly the same. There are several cheap jump scares but none that make the film memorable. Sam Rockwell's performance was way to good for the film and this remake is not doing the original any favors.",

If comedy is barely present in the new movie, horror is bigger, thanks to special effects and scary moments with a more real touch. Details of the supernatural world are amazing and Madison is a quite charming character so it kinda helps you getting involved with the story. The major problems of Poltergeist are in the script, which is told on screen in a rush and it's annoying to watch how things happen so fast, with such a poor development of characters. If you are a horror fan, you can have a few scary moments here but nothing unforgetable. If you watched the original of 1982, you might be surprised with the speed of events but you might be more scared too. It's your choice.",
