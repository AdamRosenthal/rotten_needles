The \"gayest\" character is a bi female stripper we meet briefly and never see again. She's most likely thrown in because straight boyfriends find girl-on-girl hot. Every 20 minutes or so the script throws them a bone--some boobs here, an I-imagine-hot woman there--but it's easily ignorable. Anyway, aside from that odd and unnecessary omission, the movie was much better than I expected. The plot was decent--maybe a little slow and trite--the characters were somewhat interesting, and the guys were hot to really hot. I didn't find the dancing, especially Tatum's, particularly erotic, but it was well-choreographed and your mileage may vary. As for skin, there are numerous nice butt and torso shots; no full frontal unfortunately (and a lack of crotch closeups come to think of it) but it's not porn and not meant to be.

Channing Tatum and Alex Petyfer shine as the film's central protagonists, the development of the their friendship central to the flow of the movie. Things do take a decidedly melodramatic turn towards darker themes but in the end, this shift is important to delivering the viewer to the film's final moment, the only moment of the film that features a genuine portrayal of sweetness. The biggest flaw is the development of the potential love story which seems rushed and at times it seems forgotten in the loose plot. Still, the actors all pull together to deliver some memorable moments. The eye candy is plentiful and there is plenty of nudity to satisfy men and women alike. The editing seems a little choppy but it only adds to the gritty nature of this story.

I'm upset with this movie not because of the acting or actors, and not because of the plot or sets, but, rather, I'm upset with how this movie was put together. Male stripping is prevalent throughout it all, and this is where the survival message comes in. We, the audience, are presented with the dilemma of what somebody needs to do in order to provide for their well being and stability. Mike, played by Channing Tatum, has the goal of getting out of, \"the business,\" and working on his own company. Unfortunately, since he only deals in cash, and you know why that is, his credit rating disqualifies him for a loan to start that business. A quick note, when doing a review, I hardly ever imagine that I'm going to mention a character's credit score. However, with this movie, it seems to stand out within the story line and that's not a good thing at all. The other message I mentioned was friendship. Mike has befriended a young nineteen year old named Adam, who is played by Alex Pettyfer. He's not a male stripper when the film starts, but, by the time it ends, he's completely immersed in this lucrative industry. It's a nice friendship between the two characters and they seem to have each other's back. Unfortunately, towards the end, the whole idea flops over with them parting ways. Friendship and survival are the two messages I got from this film, and I'm not even sure if those are the messages I'm supposed to get. The story line was all over the place with no clear direction until mid way through the movie when the actors are presented with the opportunity of expanding their stripping business. From there, everything goes down hill, with drugs, alcohol, and threatened relationships. I do not recommend this movie for anybody. Save your money or see another production.",

Anyways, here we go... if you remove the 20 minutes of guys dancing in leather underwear, you have a rockstar movie about a group of guys trying to make it big. Acting's great, and Matt M. is playing himself so over the top that it's actually totally hilarious and you have to hand it to him for being so rediculous. Super-hot girls, drugs, some violence- it's got everything a guy needs in a movie, and just grin and bear the few dance seens (which actually contain quite a bit of comedy in themselves). Think the movie 'Rockstar' on a smaller scale with dancing instead of rock concerts. Oh, but it's better than the movie Rockstar (Rockstar's not a bad movie though).",

The story is Ok but I felt I knew what was going to happen in the rest of the movie after the first 15 mins.  The characters are likable, but outside of McConnahey, forgettable.

I recommend this to every girl as well as every guy. Unlike most films, this film has substance beneath the erotic stripping and dancing from the handsome cast of male actors.

Channing Tatum, Alex Pettfyer, and Matthew McConaughey, are all phenomenal here and McConaughey especially nails his role. The direction from Steven Soderbergh is very good and the film does a good job making the story be more about than the stripping. Rather, it is about these characters, their struggles, and the things they must overcome. Magic Mike, however, is held back by a few things. First, there is some filler here. Some scenes really added nothing, namely the scene where Adam (Pettfyer) fondles the breasts of another male stripper's wife. While she does have a nice set, admittedly, the scene adds absolutely nothing to the film. Cody Horn is also entirely unconvincing here and her character's role in the film really does very little. She is entirely useless for this film. However, aside from that, Magic Mike is a pretty good film. Both entertaining and an entertaining character study, do not judge a book by its cover here.",
