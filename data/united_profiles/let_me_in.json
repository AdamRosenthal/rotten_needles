The original Swedish film is one of the best films of the aughts, but surprisingly, this American remake was solid and sometimes even had original ideas and a voice of its own. Director Matt Reeves has said that he adapted the story from the original novel only. This just can't be true because so much of his film is shot-for-shot replicated from the original film; the music, the cinematography, even some of the dialogue delivery. Anyway, that's not the point. \"Let Me In\" is a rare successful remake whose slight changes make the film stand as its own great work. The most noticeable alteration is how Reeves sets the movie in 1980s, Reagan-controlled America. From the music to the TV broadcasts, the Star Wars t-shirts to the arcades, this film emanates 80s American culture. Chloe Moretz has been receiving a lot of attention this year for her performance in this film and in \"Kick-Ass\", but it's Kodi Smit-McPhee who steals the show. The subtleties in his performance sometimes brought tears to my eyes. Overall, I'd say this film works on its own even though it pales in comparison to the original. Reeves vamped this up and Americanized it, which did take away a lot of the original humanity and mystery and added a lot more violence and CGI, but it did work for the most part. I wish remakes were always this solid.",

All performances are top notch, with Smit-McPhee and Moretz taking the two pre-teen leads of the original film in a new direction. While Moretz's Abby may not be quite as creepy as Eli in the original, her chemistry with Smit-McPhee lights up the screen. The real acting highlight though, is Jenkins, who gives the character of Abby's guardian real emotion and understandable motivations for his killing spree - you are almost willing him not to be caught in the scene where he is hiding in a potential victim's car. The story is more fluid and engaging than Let the Right One In, and the effects more polished, which will Let Me In a more appealing prospect to some. Others, however, may miss the originality and rawness of LTROI. Whatever your view on whether it needed to be remade merely 2 years later, Let Me In has both respect for the achievements of  its predecessor, but also manages to take the tale in a new direction, an extreme rarity with film remakes.",

      "text": "The chances of remaking a beloved Swedish import such as Tomas Alfredson's \"Lat den ratte komma in\" into an equally good, if not, superior film and entertainment, didn't bode well from the outset, and there's more than adequate historical precedence to back these well-heeded doubts up. Not with our track record, not after what America had done(almost thirty-five years ago, around the time of the Bicentennial) with the vaunted Abba sound, as mad record producers and engineers in a recording studio, reconStructed the Nordic husband and wives' soaring harmonies and propulsive rhythms into the limpest simulation imaginable, reducing the Scandinavian Beatles' musical genius(\"S.O.S.\", anybody?) into something called The Starland Vocal Band. But \"Let Me In\", far from being the vampire genre's \"Waterloo\", is actually an \"After[-dark] Delight\". Not only does \"Lat den ratte komma in\" survive its Americanization, the coming-of-age story about a monster, actually benefits from its alchemization. To the filmmaker's credit, his application of a little American major studio know-how is not the least bit detrimental to the art house approach to the narrative's pacing. It's still methodical; it's just not meanderingly so. \"Let Me In\" shorns up the story by sending the boy's father to the periphery, relegating his role to an unheard voice during the boy's mother's phonecalls. In \"Lat den ratte komma in\", Oskar's visits to the countryside brings the movie to a halt. Like Sean Parker(Justin Timberlake) in David Fincher's \"The Social Network\", the filmmaker knows that the [movie] is here,\" not there, wherever there may be in relationship to Los Alamos, New Mexico. Pueblo, perhaps? When Oskar(Kare Hedebrant) meets Eli(LIna Leandersson) in the original, the boy appears to be not especially well-versed in adult matters, so when the girl, fully nude, crawls into bed with him, following the loss of her Protector(sex partner?), there's very little erotic charge, because the moviegoer assumes that the pre-pubescent child hasn't developed an eye for the female anatomy, as of yet. His American counterpart, on the other hand, is a peeping Tom, who spies on his neighbors with a telescope, and gets more than an eyeful from a couple in the midst of foreplay. He sees breasts; he likes them. Unlike Oskar, who was barely cognizant of sex, Owen(Kodi Smit-McPhee) just isn't ready. While \"Let Me In\" doesn't get into details about the angst involved with being forever twelve like Neil Jordan's \"Interview with the Vampire\" did(the child vampire Claudia, played by Kirsten Dunst, whose hair always reverts back to its doll-like curls after she cuts it), the moviegoer speculates that the woman whom Abby(Chloe Moretz) attacks and nearly kills, was chosen so because of her womanly breasts; breasts that Owen would admire; breasts that she'll never have. \"Let Me In\" feels more like a love story than the Swedish original. The relationship between Oskar and Eli in \"Lat den ratte komma in\" seems platonic, more like brother and sister, because of the boy's sexual naivety. Recognizing that American kids are faster, the filmmaker added that scene of voyeurism to make it feel contemporary, even though, technically, \"Let Me In\" is a period piece. The best improvement to \"Lat den ratte komma in\", the presence of a gun, is quintessentially American, since the gun has no place in the Swedish landscape, in which the gun, of course, belongs to law enforcement, conspicuously missing from the source film. Hypnotized by all that lyrical snow, perhaps, distracted the moviegoer, so enamored with the taut atmospherics of the apartment complex courtyard, from wondering as to why nobody ever called the cops. It's a story contrivance similar to the \"Friday the 13th\" movies, where none of the surviving campers ever thinks to report the homicidal maniac in the hockey mask that's picking them off one by one. Saying The Starland Vocal Band is better than Abba; now that's blasphemy. But saying that \"Let Me In\" is better than \"Lat den ratte komma in\"; now that's just the truth.",

It's practically a shot-to-shot remake, it follows the LTROI very closely and the scenes that was replaced only serves to improve the movie (the \"father\" getting caught scene). Chloe Grace Moretz handles Abby very well, she's very mature compared to girls far older than her, Miley Cyrus in The Last Song comes to mind. She might not be as creepy as Eli but when she turns, my God she turns. She's going to have a bright future and her casting was a brilliant one. Another important point, Let Me In sheds light on what was very unclear in the Swedish version, which was \"the father\" character, it was finally revealed to us that he was actually Abby's \"former Owen\", it really adds some weight to the ending. It was satisfying to know Owen and Abby's fate after all they've been through, (pity Owen in a couple of decades). Matt Reeves didn't really hold back on the gore, lots of blood, added suspense, it was Americanized in a good way. I love it that Abby and Owen were attracted to each other because both are really outsiders and how they built a world of their own in the midst of everything that's going on around them, though to be fair most of the commotion was caused by Abby in the first place.

The problem is that Hollywood tends to take source material and \"up-sell\" it with loud sound effects, car crashes and explosions.  I see this time and again with comic book movies and films made from novels.  Less often, we get good foreign films that are changed around to fit what a Hollywood director or studio wants to sell to the American audience.  There was absolutely nothing wrong with Let The Right One In.  It had a creepy isolation vibe, sympathetic lead characters, a good plot, nice pacing, good editing, etc.  I really don't feel that Let Me In captured the feel of the original.  There were some good scenes left out or changed which really added to the building suspense with the town's residents as they realize something is very wrong.  The car crash scene replaces a very tense scene and just doesn't feel right.",

If this film seeks to interrogate our moral approach towards vampires, killing everyone for blood seems the wrong way to go about it. Chloe is bad & must perish if she can't see some alternative to murder.
