As a devoted fan of the Green Hornet when I watch the original series in first run on TV, I was absolutely nauseated at the bastardization of the characters.  The Green Hornet/Britt Reid was conceived and developed as a savvy, intelligent newspaper genius.  Kato, his equal partner was intelligent, resourceful and fully equal with Britt Reid, though for the sake of their partnership he played the role of a household servant.  These were two men who had no preoccupation with how drunk one could get and how to or how often to climb into bed with someone.  The Green Hornet was not some egotistical weakling dependent upon someone else to think for him, fight for him or to carry him through conflict.  A brilliant tactian, a superb hand to hand combat artist in his own right, he an Kato where truly a team that formed a formidable nemisis to crime.  This movies portrays the Green Hornet and Kato as intellectually bumbling idiots saved only by Kato's tech ability, gadgets and accidentlly pulling off the right thing at the right time.  But, what was to be expected with Seth Rogan as the writer and the lead - exactly what we got; sophomoric hormone teen age party humor intermixed with gadgetry and CGI effects.  I hope that this film is remade with a serious actor in the lead role, with a real script and dialogue in line with the original character.  It's happened before (i.e. the idiotic TV \"Batman\" of the 60's redone into the the \"Dark Knight\" of today), we can only pray it happens again!",

Here though, most of them work brilliantly because Gondry\u2019s movie never takes itself too seriously. When reality gets in the way of having fun with the moment, The Green Hornet is more than happy to ignore it. Gondry\u2019s vision is a perfect fit with the comedic tone of the script, written by Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg.

He's the kind of moron that turns up to a party thinking he owns the place, puts other people down, throws insults at people and everyone wishes that he'd just go the **** away. I know that his character was designed to be like this and there have been characters such as this before (which were done so much better) but the performance in this film was utterly vulgar. The dialogue between Brit and Kato before there fight was obscene and pathetic - never so much in my life have i ever wanted the main character in a movie beat to a pulp. And yet he still won that fight. Brit was semi-likeable to start, but as the film progressed he became an eyesore. There were some redeeming qualities and characters in the film though. Kato's performance was pretty good - and Chebowski the villian was superb. I really had to stop and think why cameron diaz was in it though - her character, save one scene, was completely pointless and a waste of time. I dont know much about the previous green hornet radioshows/movies, but from what ive read it sounds like the performance he got in this film was very insultive to the series and to the Green hornet himself.",

Since I wasn't around when the Magna Carta was signed, I have no previous experience with this franchise before this film.  The producers try to aggregate the world of the original with a contemporary feel, and the result is a horrendous piece of work.  To keep a comedic tone, they cast Seth Rogen as the Green Hornet, whose ability to play the hero is comparable to achievement of the rest of the movie.  Never at any point did it feel comfortable watching him.  He brings the crude humor people know him for, which is ill timed and conceived throughout the film.  The highlight of the rest of the cast was the cameo of James Franco, whose 2 minutes in the film was the best scene.  Very little of the actions of the characters made sense and the flow of the story was extremely choppy.  Hence, it just never feels natural.  The one positive I can give it was the awesome car the Green Hornet had, \"Black Beauty\", which more a testament that they had good taste even back in the 40's. If the creator's of the franchise would be appalled by this rendition.",

      "text": "It's an inside joke, the green smoke that emits from the gas gun. The vapor is a drug reference, an allusion to pot, and Britt Reid, the layabout son of a powerful newspaper magnate, smokes a whole lot of it. Kato is his dealer. Disguised as a servant(actually, he's a mechanic; it's politically correct), Kato makes his employer's coffee, and in every mean cup, he imprints a leaf in the foam. It's a metaphorical leaf: a marijuana leaf. In David Gordon Green's \"Pineapple Express\", the Seth Rogen character's official dealer(played by James Franco) grabs a pot of coffee and whacks his attacker in the face. When they next meet, Saul is referred to as Mr. Folgers. Britt and Kato are coded stoners, in which their drug-induced highs masquerade as natural ones. It's \"Pineapple Express\"(also starring Rogen) all over again, with James Chou substituting for Franco, who incidentally, makes a guest appearance. Playing the role first originated by the legendary Bruce Lee, the Taiwan-born Chou gets to be the Kato that the producers of \"The Green Hornet\" television series denied the martial arts expert when the ABC show made its run in the mid-to-late sixties. That dynamic on-the-set of \"The Green Hornet\" scene from Rob Cohen's \"Dragon: The Life of Bruce Lee\", where the late kung fu master(played by Jason Scott Lee) takes it upon himself to write his own stage directions, and in the process, ends up upstaging his white co-star(Van Williams, as played by Forry Smith), never happened. Just like any television program of its time, there were stringent rules on what a minority could do, which includes, of course, playing one's own race, as Lee found out when David Carradine beat him out for the role of Caine in the popular \"Kung Fu\" series. \"The Green Hornet\", despite being nearly unwatchable, in which the filmmaker, an auteur, like Green(\"George Washington\", \"All the Real Girls\"), a Terrence Malick disciple, takes a stab at impersonal commercial filmmaking, and whiffs, nevertheless, has made a movie that may interest those who remember a pivotal scene in \"Dragon\", where Lee watches Blake Edwards' \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\", stone-faced, amidst laughter in the packed movie-house, as Mickey Rooney's comic take on a Chinese national, makes him realize that he needs to go overseas if he wants to make it big. Kato was an insult to a man of Lee's stature, so this otherwise worthless remake, in a small way, pays homage to Lee, by  rescuing this minor figure from the margins of the superhero universe. When Britt says, \"Let's roll, Kato,\" it's less of a command that Kato should abide by the masked crusader of justice(or is that self-promotion) with the utmost subservience, than an invitation to go smoke some weed, as equals, like fratboys up to raising mayhem. High as a kite, the future crime-fighting team decapitates a statue that bears the likeness of Britt's overbearing father, and by happenstance, they witness a mugging. With the severed head in their possession, \"The Green Hornet\" becomes a \"head\" movie; head, in this context, pertains to drugs and drug paraphernalia, and the 1968 psychedelic film, starring The Monkees. Without thinking, they intervene on the accosted couple's behalf, in which Kato is front and center throughout the melee, relegating Britt Reid to the sidelines. It's not destiny, so much as the groovy thing to do at the moment, a happening. Only a pothead would say, \"Let's pose as villains, but act like heroes.\" Even though The Green Hornet and Kato save the city from \"Bloodnofsky\"(even their arch-nemesis is stoned), they don't get serious about their roles as saviors until the pair sobers up, which is represented by their restoration of the statue's head to its bronzed body.",

The 3D was interesting, but didn't add a whole lot to the movie, and could have been used to more potential.

The song quietly appeared in some movies, from KILL BILL: VOL. 1 (2003) to THE KARATE KID (2010), but the most recognized when it was used by THE GREEN HORNET for its title theme since the first time the series was aired in 1930s as Radio Program. The movie directed by former Video Music Director, Michel Gondry, his most recognized work is ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND (2004), but I do not know why he turned into Comedy Director since BE KIND REWIND (2008) which is funny but standard. But the real person who is really in charged in thiz newest remake is the comedian Seth Rogen. In his vision, he tries to present a good action and hilarious moment all at once. The Green Hornet is Britt Reid, the newspaper tycoon. He was accompanied by his loyal sidekick Kato (Jay Chou). The Green Hornet is declared as an outlaw, in order to gain the trust and access to the underground criminal activities, by means of their true motive which is fighting crimes. You can see during the entire film, Britt Reid did nothing special for his fighting crime efforts. All things did by Kato himself, from Kungfu expert, gadget creator, driver and even a coffee maker for Reid. The good thing is we still can find ourself laughing by seeing their chemistry. For me, Kato figure is the savior of thiz movie, Jay Chou is definitely a scene stealer. On the other hand, I still could not figure out, why the top star like Cameron Diaz is involved in thiz film? She is truly unnecessary. The fun part for me is by seeing Christoph Waltz repeats his role (after INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS (2009)) as a cruel but funny bad guy at the same time as Chudnofsky who is prefer to be called Blood-nofsky later. There are two things that you might not notice in thiz movie. In the opening scene, Chudnofsky meets one **** mobster played by James Franco (once again, most of you certainly do not think he was James  Franco, was not it?, after his famous roles in SPIDER-MAN (2002) and 127 HOURS (2010)). But what makes it most enjoyable is the cleverly funny dialogue delivered by both of them. And the second interes-thing is: do you realize there was Edward Furlong in thiz  movie? (he was young John Connor in TERMINATOR 2: JUDGEMENT DAY (1991)) in thiz movie? Furlong is one of Chudnofsky crews who called Tupper. If you are expecting thiz movie to be a mature Superheroes movie like THE DARK KNIGHT (2008) or even IRON MAN (2008), you will be disappointed. There are too much cheesy scenes and you know there are also too much unreal situations, like when Bloodnofsky wants The Green Hornet to be killed, instead searching all over the town for reasonable Green Hornet figures, they end up killing all men that wear green outfit, is that ridiculous? The only way to enjoy thiz movie is do not expect it as Action movies, but expect it as a Comedy, then you will have a fun ride. And one more thing, no matter how bad and childish thiz movie has been, but when it comes to Great Car like Black Beauty and other cool gadgets, any one could be blurred with the real quality of the film. All boys will love it! Let me summarize it for you, it was a cartoonic pleasure. Lets roll, Kato!",

It's not an instant classic like Kick-Ass, but at least it's more accessible and more consistent in tone than Super. There are some pretty good gags, and the action scenes are creative, and more importantly, fun. Seth Rogen and Jay Chou are a good double-act - Rogen is likeable as usual as the Hornet and Chou makes a surprisingly good Kato, both able to handle the stunts and able to ground the character in (an admittedly odd) reality.  Christoph Wlatz also impresses, and is starting to rack up quite an impressive list of entertaining villains. However, the film runs out of steam a little in the middle section, some sequences are a little muddy and advance the plot very little, and the wrap-up at the end is a bit sloppy. Plus Cameron Diaz appears to simply be in the film to fill out the girl-quota, and while it's nice to see Edward James-Olmos in films again, his character adds little to proceedings. So it's flawed, but Michel Gondry's Green Hornet is, for the most-part a pleasantly crazy  diversion.",

The Green Hornet is a film written by comedian Seth Rogen, and right off the bat that is the biggest downfall the film has. Rogen is very talented comedian, but this film should have never been a comedy. This film could have easily been better had it taken itself seriously at times. Rogen could have thrown in some very good themes had it been a drama. There were some serious scenes, but most of them either awkward because they did not fit with the overall mood or they eventually turned into a joke. Had Rogen taken the time to sit down not as a comedian but as a writer, he may have been able to produce a good script, because the final product which he produced seemed like it was written by a 10 year old.",

As a protagonist you expect Reid to have a typical character arc, he starts off spoilt and arrogant, he undergoes a personal tragedy, he becomes the Green Hornet and learns to be a better person etc. There was none of that in this film, for the whole hour and 50 odd minutes he is just an annoying moron. The special effects used are interesting but sometimes just bizarre like multiple \"devil's mirror\" instances which don't make sense. Cameron Diaz didn't need to be in this film, Christoph Waltz is wasted in this film and Seth Rogen shouldn't have written this film.

      "text": "I know, it was pretty hard for me to imagine Seth Rogan as a superhero too, but as it turns out things aren't exactly as they appear. In this 2011 re-imaging of the series, Rogan play Britt Reid, the son of a billionaire publisher, who (surprise surprise) is a big time party animal, with no real ambition in life. When his father passes away suddenly, Reid is given this huge empire to run and with no idea how to do it, he starts to lean on the people around him, people like Kato (Jay Chou). Reid knew Kato for years, but knew nothing of what he could create and nothing of the skills he was capable of. With Kato's help, Reid decided to take on crime in the city, only one problem, he sucks at it. This film may be the most evenly scored film I've ever reviewed, because I can honestly say my like and dislikes were exactly fifty-fifty, most notably were the cast. Seth Rogan in the right setting is brilliant and in the wrong setting is just annoying as hell, with that hardly laugh and his never taking anything seriously, it is perhaps never more abundantly apparent as it is here. Cameron Diaz also adds nothing to the cast, but name recognition and a lazy one sided performance. On the other hand, Jay Chou was fantastic as Kato, he was clever, funny, exciting, and in my opinion he made this movie, it simply isn't a superhero film with him. Then there is Christoph Waltz, the man with the mesmerizing voice who forever capture our attention in Inglorious Bastards, and has been the quintessential bad guy in everything since. The bottom line is the new Green Hornet isn't without it's problems, but the story here is better than I expected it to be, there are some stand outs among the cast, and the special effects and fight scenes were hit or miss. This is the kind of film you'll be into or you won't. Just like my list, audiences are going to be fifty-fifty on the one as well.",
