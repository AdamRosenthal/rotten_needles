The screenplay by Leslye Headland (Bachelorette) is smart and well paced also has an honest look relationships and director Steve Pink (Hot Tub Time Machine) makes the film pretty and has perfect comedic timing. The talented Kevin Hart is great! He elevates the material that is given to him and makes it vigorous, not the mention the chemistry that him and Regina Hall (Scary Movie) is energetic and humorous which will give you hearty laughs watching them. Michael Ealy and Joy Bryant are natural and sexy chemistry, their acting is charming and I don't honestly don't care if their not even close to Hart and Hall. Grade A-",

Filled with blatant sexuality this film knows no bounds to its explicit content. The two couples in the story follow very difficult paths in terms of their relationships, one more lustful while the other more romantic. Although the story focuses more on Michael Ealy's romantic relationship and his character development the spotlight is stolen by Kevin Hart's lust-filled story with his share of raunchy jokes.",
