      "text": "It's 1979 and Alan Cumming's character is making his meager living as a drag performer. He quickly meets a shy closeted hunk (Garret Dillahunt) and they end up fighting for custody of an abandoned teen with Down syndrome. This is an affecting and sweet drama that's elevated by Cumming's feisty performance (and wonderful singing), Dillahunt's lovable charm and Isaac Leyva's sweet smile. The period wardrobe is rich with wide collars and garish patterns, but it's the attitudes that provide the most jarring flashback (although they remain with us). While the subject is fodder for outrage and the story is basic, the acting and direction combine to create an appealing experience.",
