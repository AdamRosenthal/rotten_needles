I gave him a list of titles that I would like, but he couldn't find any of them, so he picked out this one, I guess because it had Michael Douglas in it.  I am truly shocked to see some positive reviews here, I thought that they would be uniformly awful, just like the movie.  I could tell that I didn't want to watch it after about 15 minutes, but I guess that I got through half of it before shutting it off.  I saw enough terrible dialogue, and Michael Douglas acting like he believed that he was a 16 to 18 year old.  It was painfully boring, along with being just awful.  Now I know that it is a great idea for me to pick out my own movies.  It is extremely rare for me to not let a movie finish, but I'm not into torture.",

You have Douglas' right hand man Danny DeVito, who gives a notable side role. The dialogue between Susan Sarandon's character and Michael Douglas' are some of my favorite moments, despite the several \"WTF just happened\" moments that will keep viewers wondering what other crazy detail will the cast unveil next.
