WKUK did better most to all of the premises to the sketches in this movie, and they do it with a cast of nobodies.

Go on, I dare you.\u201d A dare is a dare of course! Even with my low hopes, my first text when I left the movie was \u201cWell mum, I think I should quit uni and go into script writing if Movie 43 can get made!\u201d.  Three people also walked out of the movie in the first 15 minutes. Movie 43 is a series of 13 short comedy skits framed around a washed up script-writer as he pitches his idea of a movie. Movie 43 is hated by nearly every film critic out there, rightly so, however if you are not easily offended, there are a few laughs. The opening scene of Davis (Hugh Jackman) and Beth (Kate Winslet) on a blind date is enough to satisfy anyone that they could be at a decent movie. When Davis removes his scarf though, to reveal testicles hanging from his chin, you do start to wonder where this movie is going! As it turns out, the movie is mostly downhill. As usual, Anna Faris and Emma Stone were very entertaining in their respective scenes, and an advertisement on how we shouldn\u2019t abuse our day to day machines because it hurts the little children working inside them was funny, but still did not set the bar very high for an ensemble comedy. If there were not so many Hollywood stars, it is doubtful if it Movie 43 would have got general release, but the cast do give it some hope. So long as you are not easily offended, and can enjoy a movie that has no direct point or storyline, then this movie does have a few outrageously disturbing moments you have to see to believe, including discovering what the iBABE is! It does not deserve to be a box office hit though, so illegally stream it or wait until the $1 DVD rentals are out.",

There is a way to do low brow, and this isn't that way. \"Edgy\" is not created by doing something so off the wall and offensive, it's gotta be funny. Edgy is doing something different, so unique and \"thought provoking\", it's funny. If this movie was trying to be Patton Oswalt, it took a terrible left turn and ended up being a mix between Carrot Top and Dane Cook; telling a 90 minute long Aristocrat joke. *0 out of 5 stars*",

The film has a huge named cast and each segment has at least one huge name in it but it doesn't matter, it's just now A list actors working with dire material that there is no possible way to improve so they are just high paid actors annoying you by merely being in it. You don't care that its not their fault, you just hate watching this flaccid picture, this completely tone deaf, offensive, insulting and dull film. Movie 43 is directed by multiple people with real credits in actually good film but the direction in this film is awful, in every clip, its so badly constructed and framed that something must have gone wrong in the cinematography department. It's a film that despite its acting pedigree feels cheap, everything about it is cheap and the end result is one of disappointment and outright hatred thanks to some god awful comedy.",

There are those bad movies like After Earth where I am sitting there bored out of my mind, and then there are the ones where I am pretty engaged for the most part and this film was the latter. This is one of those films that is so bad it is entertaining. Some of the dumb sh*t in this movie is stupid and made me roll my eyes in digust but some of it made me laugh my head off. I feel bad for the celebrities in this film because some of the stuff they do is degrading and embarrasing but thankfully most of them have had better movies since this. Lastly, why was the Beezel skit in there it was dumb and pointless filler to get the film to the 1 hour and 30 minute mark. Now I am worried about. The Guardians of the Galaxy because that movie and the skit are done by the same guy. If you watch this movie you'll get some laughs but they wont' be for the right reasons. This is the worst films of 2013, at least based on what I've seen, but at least it left me laughing.",
