      "text": "Movie studios like burning off their comedies in March before the summer blockbusters hit so that they stand a chance, they also burn off bad films here too. Luckily enough 21 & Over isn't much like fellow party comedy Project X which was released last March and felt more like burn off than valid comedy. 21 & Over is about when Jeff Chang (Justin Chon) turns 21 and his old friends Miller and Casey (Miles Teller and Skylar Astin) come to take him out for a night on the town. However the trio soon find out a lot has changed between them and it may take some unexpected events to bring everyone back together. Right off the bat 21 hobbles itself by limiting the screen time of its funniest character. Jeff Chang is hilarious and is sadly not in the film as long as the other two leads. That doesn't mean that Miller and Casey aren't interesting but they do take some time to grow on you, especially Miller whose quite caustic at the beginning and will either entertain people or infuriate them. The fact is that by the end they are 3 very well rounded characters (some might say stereotypes) who can annoy at times but liven up a film that is more coincidence than plot. Their misadventures are tamer than that of Project X so they feel a lot more real and therefore are funnier and more entertaining and the crazy stuff that happens doesn't feel like its from another planet. The film is populated by some odd characters but they never feel ridiculous, even the LSD taking college professor seems oddly believable in the world director Jon Lucas has created. All these side characters provide some good laughs although the required love interest section of the film has nothing to it, if feels wrong and honestly the film didn't need the distraction and it ultimately ruins the ending of one of these characters story because he is forced to do the Hollywood thing and chase after the girl. The film at first suffers from some scripting problems as the film is trying to sound youthful but it doesn't quite ring true but after a while you get used to it, its just not the most expertly written dialogue and it isn't nearly as edgy as they think it is. However it is an enjoyable film because it doesn't take itself too seriously and even the ending where some lesson must be learnt it isn't forced upon you so much that it ruins the fun you had watching the film in the first place.",

The acting is adequate enough by the main stars and the events that happen during the night make you laugh from almost beginning to end. The film doesn't take long to get into the plot and you ride the wave until the credits roll. There are some moments that feel a bit too ridiculous but they don't take too much away from the viewing experience. Overall, it's worth checking out if you want a good laugh.",

      "text": "21 & Over is the directorial debut from the writers of the Hangover trilogy, and it could have easily been called The Hangover Jr. It's Jeff Chang's 21st birthday and his High School friends show up to take him out. With a big interview in the morning, the boys are planning on taking it easy, but things don't quite turn out that way. I was expecting this film to be yet another chance to exploit the magic of the first Hangover film, but surprisingly it does not. The story has many similarities, but also a uniqueness about it. 21 & Over does manage to capture that amazing chemistry and magic that made the Hangover legendary. The whole time I was watching this film, I couldn't help but think, why didn't they put this kind of thought into the Hangover sequels? Don't get me wrong, I liked the sequels, but neither one of this is as good as this film was. Justin Chon, unfortunately only known from the Twilight series, stars in a role that was seemingly made for him. This guy was so freaking funny, that I had to be careful not to piss my pants, almost every time he opened his mouth. The other stand out is Project X's Miles Teller, and while he's much better looking than Alan, he does manage to capture that loveable extreme weirdness that Zack Galifinakis had. It's easy to look at 21 & Over and say it's going to be just like the Hangover, and you wouldn't be wrong. Parts of the film are eerily similar, but the youth factor and college atmosphere does give the film a life of it's own and trust me when I tell you, it was absolutely hysterical.",

There is no cleverness from the hangover that is not  in this movie; sure Miles Teller and Skylar Astin are funny and trying but Moore and Lucas's script tries to create party movie cliche's and have  little empathy characters and  tries to be the next \"Project X\" (which was funnier than this!). So Miles Teller plays Miller, he is a lazy idiot who is good at having a good time, Skylar Astin plays Casey he is sophisticated and a nerd who does not like to party that much since highschool. They use to go to high school together  with a friend named Jeff Chang played by Justin Chong (Twilight), he turns twenty one and they take him out to get wasted and everything goes wrong. The humor is cheap and is funny time to time, terrible acting and it's script is not good; I did enjoy the humor and it's fun. Grade B-",
