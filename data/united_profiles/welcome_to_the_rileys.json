The reason is simple, I first came to metacritic as an IMDB refugee. I was fed up with the abuse of the rating system and found solace in metacritic's even keel and good mix of user and critical reviews. I never felt compelled to add my own review or ratings because they were fairly close to what other users and critics had rated them. That was until I came across this movie. I'm usually leery about any movie that had such poor critical reception as a 50, but the 8.9 in user reviews swayed me into watching it. It's now clear to me that astroturfers and teenage fans have infected metacritic as well. The infestation is unsettling to me because this was one of the last few corners of the internet where I felt I could receive a fairly unbiased and objective viewpoint on a movie before watching it. Needless to say, that does not appear to be true any longer. If you'll scan the user reviews, you'll notice that all of them came in a 3-day span and all seem to say the same thing. I'm sure that a couple of them are genuine but the rest are duplicates and some haven't even seen the movie, but just wanted to artificially inflate the rating. As for the movie itself? Dreadful. Very slowly paced, horribly acted, poorly written. Everything from the direction to the cinematography was very stiff and wooden. Absolutely no originality and definitely no emotion. The 3 points are given for a valiant effort on Gandolfini's and Leo's behalf but even they should have realized a poor script when they saw this. Utterly disappointing on so many levels.

They both took a very unlikely storyline and made it realistic due to their performances. In lesser hands, this honestly could have been a disaster. As for Kristen Stewart? She was a revelation here, raw and feral, unpredictable. I can't imagine another young actress, any of her peers, pulling this off with so much ferocity. There are weaknesses, sometimes with the pacing, sometimes with failing to juggle the three character's storylines with a balanced touch. But overall, a quietly powerful piece of work here.",

Some media outlets this movie is being described as Kristen Stewart's striper movie, but that is not the case at all, yes she plays one but this movie is so much more then that,  it is about broken people, who cross paths and help heal each other, and help each other grow.  Kristen performance truly blew me away, I one hundred precent believed that she was this character whole heartedly. She really went all out for this role, it was truly amazing to watch. I felt the whole cast really shinned. I laughed I cried i even cringed at how raw & real the scenes were.  I honestly can't get this film out of my head I strongly urge everyone to see this movie!",

      "text": "I trekked up to the Woodstock Film Festival from NJ a few weeks ago to see Kristen transformed as Mallory/Allison, and I was not disappointed. The theater was packed. While I didn't LOVE the film as a whole, it was just ok for me, I loved the characters and performances. Kristen poured her heart and soul into this role, and I completely forgot about her upcoming last hurrah in Breaking Dawn as Bella Swan. It is a quiet film until Kristen is in the frame, then it explodes with her energy and vulnerability. Manohla Dargis of The New York Times said she is an extremely appealing screen presence, and she's right. She is mesmerizing. Despite the ratty, dirty hair and pimple-covered face Kristen shines. Whatever twitches there may be it suits this character and does not detract from her believability at all. Gandolfini (Doug)  was impressive and believable as well, Tony who? His scenes with Kristen were my favorite, and I did not have a problem at all with how quickly he takes her under his wing, unlike some critics. The impulsiveness of that act, to move in and to try to become a father figure for Mallory is indicative of someone struggling with grief and coping with the death of his own daughter the best way that he can. Leo (Lois) I adore, and she, along with all of three lead actors, was perfectly cast. Again, I disagree with critics who say the unintended comedy surrounding Lois's attempts to leave the house and conquer her agoraphobia to join Doug in New Orleans was awkward or inappropriate. It was a welcome relief to the melancholy and drama that permeates the film. Lois's vulnerability and fragility  is offset with her quiet strength which she displays later with Mallory as she accepts her husband's need to rescue Mallory, or at least influence her in a positive way for the first time in her life. These characters are real, and the actors portraying them, especially Kristen, should be recognized come awards seasons if there's any justice in this world.",

It wasn't like watching a movie. It was more like watching a documentary. Because everything from the smallest facial expressions, to the most insignificant gestures is just saturated with texture and emotion. It's the quick and thoughtless remarks that the characters make, and the angles of certain glimpses of camera work that allow us, the audience, to understand what is really going on underneath all of the outward doings and occurrences. I was invested, I was interested, I was engaged and I cared about everything that was happening in this fictional world that died in two hours. Aspiring filmmakers, take notes.
