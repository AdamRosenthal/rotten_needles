Since then, there are only two things certain about early action film releases; there will always be one featuring kick-ass icon Jason Statham playing the younger, balder super human hero, and one featuring Neeson, usually playing a wrinkled, more seasoned action star who could very well be your father (or grandfather)\u2013which was badass three films ago. Deep down I am secretly waiting for Hollywood to come to their senses and announce a showdown between the two action superstars. Now talk about a kick-ass early year action release that we kinda saw coming. With something as expected as a Neeson release, also comes the expectation for a cliched, unoriginal, and purely entertaining action story line. Unexpectedly collaborating again with his Unknown director Jaume Collet-Serra, Neeson buckles up for an actioner set in the sky. Unlike the highly entertaining nineties guilty pleasure Air Force One, Non-Stop seems to steer more in the direction of the wholly disastrous Flightplan. After all is said and done, the film becomes a constant re-hashing of previous wind-cutting skyline action films without much original altitude.",

The film works for the most part until it's final act. The didactic tone of Non-Stop's final third serves to amplify its passable hokeyness. Does Marks really need to be an alcoholic and a grieving father and the victim of conspiracy? Does he really have to be the protector of a plane-load of innocents and the father figure to a little girl flying alone for the first time? As Non-Stop answers its narrative questions, it cranks up the action dial to preposterous proportions. It resists its natural tendency to be slick, simple, and tense. But when Collet-Serra hands it off to the talent, Non-Stop is a gripping battle of banter. Agatha would approve.",

Unlike being a perfect bad-a** from \"Taken\", \"Unknown\", etc, he was shaping and molding into a bad-a** even though his character was completely damaged. While some characters are heard more than others, the ones who stick out are the ones that make the movie engaging. Overall, it's a thriller with some thrills even through its cliches.

I guess some people say the scenarios that take place in the film are unrealistic but honestly its nothing out of the ordinary for this genre. It seems like some people don't care if a movie is unrealistic mainly superhero movies but then with movies like this they expect realism.

      "text": "While Non-Stop doesn't break any boundaries when concerning originality, it does make up for it by taking its namesake as literally as possible. The film (which sees air marshall Bill Marks attempting to stop a killer on board a trans Atlantic flight) manages to dabble in a lot of different areas, ranging from action and suspense to comedic one liners, and does so mainly successfully. While i wasn't gripping the arms of my seat as much as last year's Captain Phillips, most of the film's success comes from the tension created when Marks (Neeson) desperately tries to uncover the murderer whilst simultaneously attempts to keep the crowd in check. The acting is grounded throughout, with Neeson taking the fore as a unkempt man simply trying to stop what appears to be an impossible scenario from unfolding along with some impressive dramatic moments between the marshall and his increasingly worried passengers. While I won't name characters, I personally feel that the inclusion of a love interest (which felt luke warm and unnecessary) was jarring and superficial and this was one of the aspects of the film that resonated with me the least. However, there were more than a few moments that made the film stand out, particularly a climactic gun fight which sees Neeson fly down a plane aisle in zero g firing a hand gun. Overall Non-Stop is highly entertaining thriller that will certainly keep audience members guessing and one that I highly recommend and while it may not be nominated for any Oscars, it certainly has proven to be one of the more enjoyable films of this year so far.",

The plot had some potential but lost sight of that five minutes in. The simplicity of the much used action movie format \u201ctransfer the money or people die\u201d got boring quick. If there was anything that made this movie any different from the many others like it\u2019s kind it was the unique airplane setting. One thing that the setting failed to do was make you feel claustrophobic, which should have been a huge priority for the makers. Something this movie had on its side was it\u2019s cool templets used throughout to show viewers a unique perspective of the threatening texts received that lead the movie\u2019s plot. There were also some cool transitions but that's about it. In terms of script critique it was a mess from the start. Poor dialogue and bad characters rained on the pity party which started around the ten minute mark. One thing that really surprised me was how bad the acting really was. Liam Neeson does a decent job in this movie, he was just dealt a terrible storyline that no actor can carry, especially with such a lame supporting cast and a weak script (humor was interjected at the most unrealistic times, throughout the whole movie). He has played great rolls before; I loved his work in Taken and The Gray, and he was the only saving grace of this film. I often found myself yelling at the TV in frustration, out of how unrealistic the movie was. Any sort of entertainment was blocked by stupidity. Toward the end of the movie it became so overly clich\u00e9 I wanted to turn it off knowing I wouldn't miss anything; I should have done that in the beginning. Skipping this movie is probably a wise choice because Non-Stop was nonstop terrible.",
