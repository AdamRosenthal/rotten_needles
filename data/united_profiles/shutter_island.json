Let me also be the one to say that these other people who are giving bad reviews, well they mostly do not have a good IQ or any knowledge of psychology. These people were probably just hoping for a scary movie. Because after the trailer, I was expecting the same. But I still enjoyed the movie even though I didn't get scared at all (because it's not a scary movie) is because I am a college student with a good IQ and understand of psychology and how the brain works. I also know what psychologists do and how they used to treat patients in the old days (hence why the setting is 1954 and not now). You don't even need to KNOW anything about psychology to appreciate this movie. Just a simple curiosity of how the brain works is a good start. I love action movies and scary movies but I also like INTELLIGENT movies and that's what this is. Those of you who say you saw the twist coming, I say bullcrap. Maybe some of y'all did but the twist doesn't take place until there is like 20 or less minutes left in the movie and the whole first half doesn't leave any clues as to what is coming. If you are an intelligent person or a curious person to how we humans function and our mind works, this is a GREAT movie. Great acting and great plot. I love psychology or most of it atleast and like I said, I am a college student who enjoys intelligent movies and not just the ones where there is plenty of violence, comedy, and sex. So those of you who gave it bad reviews, I'm sorry I have to say it but y'all are probably just dumb kids or dumb people in general who don't have a clue how you even function as a human being. Watch the movie and tell me if I'm wrong.",

The beautiful yet gritty cinematography left you on the edge of your seat for the next shot. The script was one of the best I have ever seen on screen, leaving you repeating the dialogue in your head from the previous conversation. DiCaprio knocked it out of the park with one of his best acting performances, not to mention everyone else in this movie did really good. The story is unpredictable and once the Scorsese credits hit the sliver screen you will still be questioning what you just saw. In my opinion, its one of the best films ever made. A must see!",

After a devastating hurricane hits the island, more and more answers come and you'll be able to start piecing together the twisted story. But the twist ending will have you on the edge of your seat, as it will make you re-look at the entire story again to realize the real truth.

Maybe It is not the finest, but I think thiz is one of his best performance so far. DiCaprio collaborates the fourth time with Martin Scorsese, the last three are: GANGS OF NEW YORK (2002), THE AVIATOR (2004), and THE DEPARTED (2006). Scorsese himself is a well-grounded drama Director. His previous memorable classics are: TAXI DRIVER (1976), RAGING BULL (1980), and GOODFELLAS (1990). It is about Teddy Daniels (DiCaprio), an US Marshall comes to the island to investigates some mysterious case. The Island is the prison facility for mental illness. Thiz movie supported by high-caliber Casts, such as: Ben Kingsley, Mark Rufallo, Mark Von Sydow, Jackie Earle Haley, plus Michelle Williams. The screenplay on thiz movie is grandeur. Scorsese with his experiences arranged every scene effectively. The exploration is classic, we even could seen **** atmosphere here. The movie scores also help a lot to build such an intensive tension. The great example was on the opening scene, when Daniels and his partner arrived on the island for the first time. When they observe the surroundings preserves by maximum securities, the gates open one by one. It is just a usual scene, but the scores multiply it into ten times thrill. The twist ending is meant to be shocking. But unfortunately, I already see it where the story will go in the middle of the movie. When a conversation between Daniels and Rachel (Patricia Clarkson) on the scene in the cave. Daniels said angrily, I am an US Marshall, No one can stop me! (Spoiler Alert!) That is the time I clearly knew he was the patient. In the end, if we got a movie that every scene put in for a reason. That is the time when you already got an effective and flawless movie. Scorsese scores again!",
