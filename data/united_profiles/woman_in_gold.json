Most of them are of the film festival award winners, produced to impress movie critics rather than entertain moviegoers.  The best example was Tree of Life, which had a near 100 Metacritic score but we absolutely hated.  Woman in Gold was the opposite.  Perhaps it was our fondness for Mirren.  Perhaps it was my Holocaust sensitivity (I went to my ancestral home, Poland, last year, and visited Auschwitz-Birkenau, where we believe family members were murdered).  But we LOVED this movie.

Most people in the Holocaust who survived did so based on luck; the outcome was generally the same whether the person fought or didn't fight the Nazis.  So to see a film about a woman and her lawyer who took on the Austrian government to fight for what was rightfully hers was such a wonderful balance to that sense of helplessness that many people felt.  The acting in this film was excellent, the character development of both the main actress and the lawyer was well done, and the portrayal of those in authority in the Austrian government concurred with what I understand to be the governmental attitude in Austria after WWII.

The film is engrossing and well paced and one need not be an attorney to follow and understand, the legal niceties it contains. One can talk about millions who were brutalized by the members of the Third Reich but the impact of the crimes they committed becomes even greater when the story is told about one person and one piece of property.

This is a must-know story, and a must-see film, in my opinion.  I dare you to view it and not come out of the theater with a sincere desire to do more, be better, and expand your existence.

But the whole movie is ultimately an incredibly shameless machine for emotional manipulation and beating the dead horse of Nazi evil for the easiest effects imaginable. In fact, the hard truth is that the movie's this year's annual Holocaust movie clearly made by the Israel Lobby neocon wing of Hollywood to keep the American masses Pavlovian suckers for \"Never again!\" so that when the neocons roll it out again to con the American masses into supporting Tom Cotton's proxy war for Israel for \"regime change\" in Iran, the suckers will bite yet again, in an uncontrollable reflex that has been brilliantly drilled into them by Israel Lobby Hollywood for so many years now for just such an occasion. The attention to Pavlovian detail is such that they've made the heroine father look just like Stefan Zweig! How's that for tugging at the heartstrings of the literate, the ones most in danger of dismissing the movie for its shameless manipulations. Nothing is harder to make a good film about than the Holocaust, because any work of art has to avoid cliches and stock responses like the plague. Manipulative schlock like Woman in Gold does NOTHING but trade in both. It looks so good, and Mirren's such a good actress that the film might strike the unwary as better than it is.

The film tells the true story of Maria Altmann (played by Mirren) an Austrian woman who fought to reclaim Gustav Klimt\u2019s now famous portrait of her aunt Adele Bloch-Bauer, which was taken by the Nazis before World War II began. Reynolds plays Randy Schoenberg, Altmann\u2019s lawyer. Daniel Bruhl and Katie Holmes have supporting roles in this film but are fairly underused. Mirren and Reynolds\u2019 performances are really the only two in this film that matter. They are really the only two essential characters. Mirren was great throughout the whole film playing a woman who just wants the one thing that reminds her of the life she once had. I have not seen many of Mirren\u2019s performances because she generally stars in lesser known projects that don\u2019t always get a lot of attention, but her performance in this film interests me to see some of her other projects. Ryan Reynolds is better in this film than I expected and hopefully he will be able to able to continue to improve with Self/Less which comes out this month and more importantly when he plays Deadpool next year. At the beginning it looked like he may have been miscast because he seemed to be dragging down the dialogue. It is so hard not to associate him with the romantic comedies that he is known for. However as the movie goes along he improves steadily and by the end I thought it was one of his greatest performances. Woman in Gold is certainly a slow film and the story is fairly dull. I think the film could have been a bit more inspirational and the movie goes by quick without really delivering a memorable plot. There is also little development with the characters and I felt like I hardly knew them even when the movie ended. Woman in Gold is certainly not a terrible movie but will not be suitable for a casual movie fan.",

I did not know Tatiana Maslany was in it until yesterday, when I was watching it VOD. I did know the subject matter and was interested in that from the beginning.  Watching the film, I was often teary eyed. And I was reminded of how dreadfully people were treated by the Nazis in Austria. The writing was strong enough; I was glad for the flashbacks; but watching, and thinking about it in retrospect, I have concerns about the casting. First, Ryan Reynolds was not the right actor for his role as the young lawyer. He didn't look right, sound right, and he was not able to show the kind of passion or complexity that the role required or should have required. I felt almost that his part was written down to fit his limitations as an actor. (In fact, the show felt underwritten overall.)  Now, I will say something controversial, although as this little review will likely never be read, maybe not so much!  I am active in supporting greater representation of non-white actors in film and television, and am sensitive especially to what the activists call 'white washing'. This is where the role of a South Asian hero, for example, is played by a white actor for his presumed greater box office appeal. I get the realities of Hollywood. But on this one, I wonder about the grandson of a famous Austrian Jewish composer, Schoenberg, being played by Ryan Reynolds, to my knowledge not Jewish. Other than movie star power, what did he bring to this film? He didn't even bring a back ground in synch with that of the character to draw upon. And he just isn't that strong an actor.  Helen Mirren is Helen Mirren of course, but not Jewish. Her experience does however encompass loss of country though, as her father was White Russian who because of the Russian Revolution became British. Tatian Maslany is apparently not of Jewish background but is of German-Austrian-Ukrainian background, her mother was an immigrant, and has fluent German. (And was wonderful in the role.)  But I keep wondering about the decision to cast Ryan Reynolds. Other than box office, there is nothing about him as an actor or a human being that seems to fit the character. Maybe the real Randy Schoenberg was really bland, lacking in passion, and not a particularly good public speaker?",
