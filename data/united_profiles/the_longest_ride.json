I believed all young male lovers were handsome (and hairless) and all young female lovers were pretty and both had beautiful, usually blue eyes. Their stories consisted of meeting, falling in love, having something come along to break them up and, most important of all, everyone lived happily ever after. I knew all older folks were played by first class character actors and everything took place in beautiful towns, cities, counties, States and countries.",

We did like the love story of the couple in the past better than the couple's story of the present. But whatever, love is love anyway couples have it.",
