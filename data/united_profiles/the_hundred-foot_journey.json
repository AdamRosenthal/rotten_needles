This time it's about how most people do not understand true flavour and how to cook good food. This movie will not only make you smile, but will inform you of something you have been missing your whole life. Indian food.",

Cultural bias is the grist on which this movie turns, but the director (Lasse Hallstrom) elects for superficial treatment and resolution of the issues in favor of the typical happy ending.",

SO... don't, please don't see the movie on an empty stomach like I did!!!  Peppered with comedy snippets throughout, this is a drama that will touch the heart, a perfect \"couples\" flick!!  There are scenes with a bit of Hindi/Urdu and French spoken, and no subtitles, but if you don't speak those languages, no problem, no translation lost.  Besides a simmering (no pun intended) romance, one of the other themes are how different ethnicities will view each other based on preconceived notion;  from ugly racism to a celebration of humanity.  A very global movie.  8.5/10",
