The car selection isn't all that varied but the action and chase scenes make up for it. The setting is similar to a track from the Need For Speed games, and the overview screen of the race fits in perfectly. The story is nothing to look too deeply into. It has common themes found in most racing movies, aspects like revenge and honor. The characters honestly felt a bit stale only because they seem so familiar. Michael Keaton's role was probably my favorite, though Aaron Paul & Kid Cudi did very good (though I was hoping for some sort of Breaking Bad reference; a perfectly timed **** or crystal blue colored car, anything lol).

That's because it's really less a video game movie than it is the next Torque or Biker Boyz. So it looks like it's up to Warcraft to be the video game movie that could finally elevate the genre. Despite all the automotive eye candy and action movie elements, Need for Speed never provides the viewer with a sense of escape or abandon. It doesn't make you want to buy the game or go racing out of the cinema parking lot lost in some lead foot fantasy. It makes you want to buy a Volvo and drive 35mph.",

Ever since \"Breaking Bad\" ended, I've been waiting to see each of those actors see what they could do on the big screen. And still, I received a great Aaron Paul performance, but not enough of a good movie. \"Need For Speed\" is a murky action movie with a lame and cliched story and an often murky screenplay. The acting  from pretty much everyone else in the movie didn't even stand a chance in comparison to Aaron Paul and even Michael Keaton. The chemistry from the main cast didn't work. They looked like they had fun playing off each other, but there was no spark between any of them; with the exception of Aaron Paul and Imogen Poots. The chemistry between actually and surprisingly worked. Even though their relationship is cliched, you end up buying it. Overall, \"Need For Speed\" is a disappointing action-thrill ride that only presents great action and Aaron Paul, but essentially fails at everything else. I give it a C!",

Great violence (God, that sounded cruel), little bit of humor, good acting, and fast cars. Now that sounds like some fun to me, and of course it's in this movie. The biggest problem is that it's just nothing new and has many cliches. Let's talk about the biggest attraction first: Aaron Paul. He's just as good as he should be, and his love interest is tied up with him. Supporting cast? Nothing more than good. Is it too similiar to Fast and Furious? Some elements are taken straight out of it, but it still feels like Need for Speed very much. The action here is what you'd expect. Cars get damaged and or blown up, but it's introduced amazingly, both looks and awesomeness. The cliche?

Although the premise of a revenge film revolving around drag racing sounds intriguing, it is filled with a sloppy, disjointed plot and boring stock characters. Wastes relatively good acting by the leads of Aaron Paul and Dominic Cooper by creating rather disconnected, unempathetic characters. Michael Keaton brought a strong comedic performance to help break up any tension throughout the film. However the tension never really seemed to be there at the level it should have been. The film relied too heavily on the video game franchise and cars rather than actual story, trying to cash in on the current success of its star. If the writers focused on a more innovative story for a rather overdone genre than flashy cars perhaps this film would have defined a new age of racing films.

Now in the past, these movies are highly criticised for how bad they really are, and Need for Speed is probably the best adaptation of a video game I've seen so far. Let me give you the pros and the cons, the pros are that the car stunts were amazing as they attempted not to use CGI to conduct dangerous stunts with expensive cars, speaking of cars, I loved the variety of cars used in the film, they are all beautiful and loud and fast. Now the cons, the cast I swear to god was picked absolutely blind, on the exception of Michael Keaton who played The Monarch, but everyone else was poorly picked, the role of Toby Marshall played by Breaking Bad's Aaron Paul was very stale and at the same time hey was trying to hard to be just like Dominic Toretto in The Fast and the Furious franchise which made a very poor attempt in trying so, and the unnecessary length of the film at 134 minutes was stuffed like a thanksgiving turkey with a bunch of filler scenes that did not connect to film's main story at all. Overall the film was not great, but ok as it stuns me for the stunts and the story which was slightly flawed was also ok. This is a sign that hollywood is slowly understanding how to make video game adaptation one step at a time starting with Need for Speed.",
