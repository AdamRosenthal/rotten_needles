Too rational? are you kidding? you actually need 'magic' to enjoy something? Sherlock Holmes is ALL about the mystery being solved, everything being presented and known. If you don't like that then why did you even bother to go watch? @the Sherlock Holmes purists, every other hero of some of the oldest stories in time have transitioned into numerous changes like this one(batman, being a man without powers, being a sort of detective on his own, was changed a lot over the years). The picture of however you imagined Sherlock to be might not be the same as the next person beside you. Its open to interpretation, unless you seek to extinguish everyone's creativity due to your close mindedness. The characters weren't empty, their relationship was fully realized (Sherlock and Watson, two detectives fighting over small, inconsequential things, Watson being tired of Sherlock's antics, and yet what unifies them is the mystery for the time being. Sherlock feeling stuck in his life, feeling as though he is being abandoned, trying to pull his old friend back into the game so he wont be the only one who's trapped and alone, his character develops from there but I wont spoil it) and it was very much apparent that they cared deeply about each other, but most would rather that their emotions surface in a much more obvious way. Its ridiculous to give this movie a bad review just because you didn't bother paying attention.",

      "text": "Hmmmm. There are action sequences, plenty of one liners, and Robert Downey Jr. I can only deduce that this is another Hollywood box office smash. And silly old me, I just saw the film. My friends pestered me about this for the longest time. They loved the film, and were positive I would too. I told them I'd get around to it, until finally one of my friends lent me the movie to watch. My feelings about this unique film are a little mixed. The film wants to be clever, but very little smarts at all are needed to view this film. Naturally, this film is geared towards teenage boys, who for the most part, are not interested in an intellectually stimulating film. They just want to see Downey deliver witty lines, and watch him beat up thugs. So, if that's what you came to see, you will not be disappointed. However those wanting a more intelligent film, should not look here. Even when the Sherlock Holmes is explaining how he figured out the case at the end, it's through many clues that the viewer didn't have a chance of deciphering themselves, which is quite contradictory to what Sherlock Holmes is all about. I know the target audience, so I expected as much, but my mother who viewed the film with me, was quite irritated at the obscure clues. A good mystery should be tailored so that the audience can try to solve the mystery too (and make it hard enough, so that they can't figure it out). This film does nothing of the sort, instead, we merely learn at the end, that Sherlock had seen things that the camera never shows us, making it impossible to solve the mystery ourselves. But like I said, the target audience doesn't care about such things, so therefore, the film is oddly \"smartless.\" But I digress. On the other hand, the cast does a fantastic job at portraying each of their characters, even if some lines were delivered a little hammy. Also, the musical score, composed by Hanz Zimmer, is very good, and absolutely hilarious. Music doesn't commonly make me smile (out of humor anyway), but this score did. Though many of the action sequences were rather ordinary, there were definitely a handful that kept me on the edge of my seat, and I'm sure the target audience will eat it up. The film is quite amusing, as one can expect with from the leading actor, but for some reason, the film wasn't quite as humorous as I was expecting. It was funny enough, anyway. Lastly, and this may be a major problem for some, but this film just doesn't feel like Sherlock Holmes. It feels like Robert Downey Jr. makes another million dollars. I suppose this is to be expected, but somehow, I was hoping that there might be some sort of Sherlock spirit to this, but alas, there was not. I was not wowed, but I most definitely enjoyed myself. I do wish, though, that the film was a bit more intelligent, and this film doesn't feel like Sherlock Holmes at all. Regardless, this is an enjoyable romp, and I'll probably catch the sequel on DVD. Consider me entertained, but not impressed.",

Surprisingly, Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes is dissimilar to my tendency of aversion of big budget films.  Contrary to what I just stated, Sherlock Holmes is undoubtedly not a thoughtful film. But unlike other films in my categorical standards, Holmes  makes up for it with its beautiful art direction and action sequences. Even though they are not accurate to the time setting, the scenes of combat are well choreographed and give the film personality.  Additionally, the art direction is great, the images of vintage London are just mesmerizing giving the film much needed charm to successfully emulate the original Sherlock Holmes.  Lastly, Downey Jr's replicates  Conan Doyle's literary character to English perfection with his remarkable false accent and smug personality. With these statements said, the main flaw is the lack of mystery.  Sherlock Holmes is a renowned literary character that was famous for the mysteries he solved and how he manipulated every sort of evidence to solve the case. Even though there are some traces of it, Sherlock Holmes ultimately doesn't create a plot of anonymity.   It is obvious that the film focuses on action, and that only.  That does not necessarily ruin the film, I found the film thoroughly entertaining. But the audience should simply lose the thought that Sherlock Holmes is a mystery; because it ultimately is not thought provoking or mysterious in any way.",

The story is intoxicating from the first minute. The acting is immensely entertaining. The sets were exquisite. The directing was surgically executed. Like Batman Begins, the story is almost nonstop, even up to the very end when the sequel is teased. Except instead of the Joker, we learn that Professor Moriarty will be the next villain!",

Sherlock Holmes is a well-known detective on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle novels (Which first time published on 1887). Sherlock on thiz movie is Robert -Iron Man- Downey Jr., Accompanied by his fellow side-kick Dr. John Watson (played by Jude Law). The Other Casts are Rachel McAdams and Mark Strong. Downey Jr. seem does not care how to perform Sherlock authentically, otherwise he just act with his style and just have fun on his version of Sherlock. As we knew, Sherlock is discreet, calm, and charismatic person. But in the end, I think viewers also agree to put beside the original Sherlock for a while, bcoz thiz version is enjoyable. In the overall, The movie was very good enough and very funny with a good fresh concept. The Director is Guy Ritchie. Ritchie known as Indie-Director, which is his best works are LOCK, STOCK, AND TWO SMOKING BARRELS (1998) and SNATCH (2000). The plots in thiz movie is excited on the beginning, a little lame on the middle of film, and closed with just customary ending. After watching thiz movie, maybe its cross on our mind, Downey Jr. on his version of Sherlock resembles with Will Smith performance on WILD WILD WEST (1999). But we must to admit that thiz movie have some plus poins compare with Smith WILD WILD WEST. Both of the movies show us a new style on the legendary figures. Here he comes, The Funky Sherlock!",

What might have been missed is the intellect that was deduced by Holmes, and that people may more have noticed the significant amount of violence because of it being seen on screen, and you have to look closer in order to pick up the lesser significant and more unnoticed details. Sherlock Holmes may have had violence and explosions in it, but it showed Holmes as an experienced person that didn't just go around injuring people for the fun of it. He looked for clues, he came to conclusions, he used logic. Ritchie may have spiced up this new Holmes a little more than people expected, but it added to the fun of the movie. It didn't show him in a new light, it just showed us his capabilities and his strength for his environment. People might not have picked up on this, and the fact it might have been 'too complicated and boring' means that they probably weren't focusing on it as such to figure it out for themselves. You might have expected what was going to happen, seeing as it was based on a piece of famous literature, but Sherlock Holmes of course is opened to interpretation. Then why go in there and see it, not bother to focus on the finer details, at least enjoy the film, and beforehand think you're going to expect something completely different? It's confusing how people thought this film would happen, and how it was going to turn out. With all these production teams and crews designing and creating this imaginative piece of media, why think you're going to get a tame bunch of people solving mysteries without any spice like the book says?",

Robert Downey Jr, Jude Law, Rachel McAdams, and Mark Strong, are all excellent and the case presented to Holmes is very compelling. I really like the explanation of what went down at the end, really was nice to see all of the elements of the film come together like that. The film was also really well shot and the story was told nicely, so kudos to the cinematographer and director Guy Ritchie for those things, respectively. The slowed down effect used on a couple of occasions was also incredibly cool and well down, though I don't really think those particular scenes were needed, but I certainly appreciated the craft  there. There are a few other elements I didn't really think this one needed, but overall, it was a very enjoyable and well made film that serves as good entertainment for two hours.

Even if you've never read any of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's classic mystery stories involving the British detective, you probably already know of his astounding observational powers, proclivity for cocaine in the absence of mental stimulation, and that he's    a master fighter? All right, so obviously, Robert Downey Jr.'s Holmes is taking some slight liberties in that arena, and overall the movie is certainly aiming to please the modern action audience with a tale inclusive of rather frenetic action sequences and quickly-paced mystery elements. Too quickly-paced, in my opinion. The film just seemed to go by a little too fast for me, and I never really got the sense of any real suspense or palpable conflict. In all honesty, this really felt more like a 2-hour promo for the sequel to get you primed for a battle against Holmes's equally immortal archnemesis, Moriarty. However, there is still some fair entertainment value to it all, and in the end I enjoyed it enough to want to check out the second film.",

Sherlock Holmes is more of an action movie than a witty, mysterious, compelling thriller, what a Sherlock Holmes should be! Just look at the show Sherlock, they hit everything right on the head with how to portray a diverse character like Holmes perfectly. Aside from Holmes being an action hero, there is also a very Holmes-like trait missing in this flick. He is not funny, neither sarcastic nor cynical throughout the entire film!
