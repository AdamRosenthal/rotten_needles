      "text": "Recuperating \"The Tourist\", the unfairly panned thriller made by a tourist himself(a German making his first Hollywood splash), means recuperating the performance by Johnny Depp, the risk-taking actor who's receiving the worst critical notices of his career. The big gamble he takes here is to give an anti-performance, as if \"Charade\", the 1963 comedy-thriller starring Cary Grant and Audrey Hepburn, was directed by Jim Jarmusch, the director of \"Dead Man\", which featured Depp in the leading role. Dead is how the many naysayers of \"The Tourist\" would characterize Frank Tupelo, a Wisconsin schoolteacher on holiday in Italy; opaque too, as Depp's somewhat morose line-readings will frustrate moviegoers who expect the actor to be, well, fun, through the employment of banter and sheer animal magnetism with his leading lady. But instead, the vacationing American seems diminished by Elise(Angelina Jolie), and on the verge of disappearing altogether. Jolie, dressed from head to toe in glamorous duds, radiates sex from every bedecked pore of her personage, turning the heads of men and women alike wherever those legs take her. It's this potential for the setting off of fireworks that many will cite as the reason why \"The Tourist\", and ultimately, Depp, disappoints, in which the actor, who made his name initially by playing mutes and near-mutes(\"What's Eating Gilbert Grape\", \"Benny and Joon\", and \"Edward Scissorhands\"), seemingly picked the inopportune time to revert back to his boy-man persona, by talking in a soft and constrained voice. To be perfectly frank, he's sort of a drag, not at all cut out for romance with a sublime beauty like Jolie. But is it a bad performance? If you said, \"Yes,\" that means you're overlooking the third act, in which the revelation of Frank Tupelo's true identity changes the complex of Depp's subdued and fussy performance. Suddenly, the mannerisms that Depp uses to color his cheesehead tourist with, mannerisms which, at the time, seemed nothing more than an eccentric actor's whim(remember his Pepe LePew-meets Keith Richards voice in \"The Pirates of the Caribbean\" movies), turned out to be an invention of Alexander Pierce's making, not Depp's. This time, the voice isn't a novelty, but intrinsic to the character. In \"The Tourist\", the actor(who minced like Angela Lansbury in Tim Burton's \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow) is one step removed from his latest vocal styling, since it's, in essence, his character playing a character, as Alexander tries to win Elise over by being Frank, but not honest, and in the process, seems uncomfortable in his own skin. Quite understandably, he has some mixed emotions over stealing the woman he loves from himself. And since Depp chooses to portray this conflict with utter seriousness, \"The Tourist\" can sometimes be too angst-ridden for its own good. The original Alexander, the man whom Elise fell in love with, no doubt, had he graced the screen, would have made for a more entertaining movie. As Frank, the wanted man is forced to act counterintuitively all throughout his pallid seduction of Elise, and as a result, many of the scenes where fire is needed(especially the hotel sequence leading up to the moment where the couple's sleeping arrangements are finalized), Depp brings the ice, because the schoolteacher, in Elise's own words(more or less), is not a man who does exactly as he pleases. This comment, made in reference to the fake cigarette which Frank \"smokes\", telegraphs the notion that we're looking at the ghost of a face, blowing ghost smoke from a ghost cancer stick. Elise senses Alexander. \"The Tourist\" treats plastic surgery like a metaphor for reincarnation. The fake cylinder(and fake intrigue: the paperback spy novel he totes around) suggests Alexander's essence, inspiring Elise to criticize the name that her lover bestowed on his permanent alter-ego as being \"terrible\", a word that hardly describes \"The Tourist\", and Depp's performance as a man in transition, haunted by the phantom of his own being, and the horrible realization that his girlfriend is no longer in love with him, the old him.",

Mysterious story, city of Venice and promising Director as well, everything looks just fine, what could go wrong? But what you are about to experience is no other than being a tourist and get misguided. The movie based on Luc Besson and Sophie Marceau movie titled ANTHONY ZIMMER in 2004. An American tourist Frank is approached by a mysterious girl Elise in a train (who can deny beautiful girl like Angelina Jolie anyway, do you?) on journey to Venice, Italy. In the beginning, Elise has hidden intention to use Frank as a decoy from the hunt of police and Russian mafia. Now everyone thinks Franks is her long-lost fugitive lover, an intelligent thief Alexander Pearce. Actually, the basic material is very promising, with some twists and turns in development. But in the process, they could not get a precise romantic atmosphere done right. The interaction between the two is stiff and awkward. Frankly says, there is no chemistry here. In spite of Johnny Depp is my No. 1 favorite Actor nowadays (I have all of his movies, all!) but unfortunately in thiz movie he looks too childish next to Jolie. You can see there is still a little bit Capt. Jack Sparrow in Depp character. He looks charming, but most of the time he becomes so uncomfortably clumsy and lazy. On the other side, for me Jolie more looks like -a supermodel walking in her runaway catwalk. Yes, with the smile like that, and her sharp eye gaze, beautifully elegant dresses, who can resist the whole eye candy package. But I have to say, it could be the most boring appearance of Angelina Jolie of all-time. What she does here just keep smiling all the time, without doing exploration for her character. Jolie is doing what I called Robotic Performance.  Too much smile, too much pride, and too much eyelashes. A better performance comes from Paul Bettany as Inspector John. The other Supporting Casts are Timothy Dalton, Rufus Sewell and the memorable one, Reginald Shaw who is very convincing as Berkoff, Russian mobster boss. The Director of thiz movie is Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck. I found myself more enjoying his latest creation, one of respectable German movies in 2006, THE LIVES OF OTHERS. It is supposed to be ravishing, but rather than that, it is happened to be ravenous. In the end, if you came to the theater to see some good looking faces. Well\u00e2",

But these were wickedly shattered by a disappointing story and poor use made of the abilities of two talented actors. Failed romantic pairing, as Jolie is styled visually as a middle aged Sophia Loren to a naive and playful Depp. Little wit and style, even from Depp and the only star in this show is Venice. The Tourist is replete with shallow dialogue, and unbelievable coincidences amidst beautiful cinematography and a fun rooftop and the obligatory Venetian canal chase. Jolie is usually an attractive woman but her skeletal size, (razor collarbones and noticeably thin arms) is cause for concern. Felt like we had been there and seen this, (done much better) before. Pocket your ticket fare and catch it on DVD or Netflix only if you don't mind a some what vapid \"B\" flick or enjoy pretty scenes of Venice.",

The dialogue takes a backseat infavor of action.  In fact, the action scenes and chases in The Tourist are just plain silly and plodding.  A boat chase scene through the Venice canals is just ludicrous.  The plot starts to come off the tracks as much as the action chases through blatantly contrived settings.  There is a very formal scene in a ballroom with tuxedos and gowns whose only purpose is to show the audience the two leading stars in fine attire.  They have no other purpose there.  If The Tourist wanted to be snappier and land a more lasting punch, they would dial it down; less action, less weaponry, less makeup on Jolie, and the surprise ending...definitely less of that.",

      "text": "The Tourist proves that combining beautiful vistas with beautiful people doesn't always equate to cinematic quality. Whilst not awful, the movie just isn't striking in any way. It's not particularly funny, the leads have little chemistry so it's not particularly romantic and it's certainly nowhere near exciting. What you're left with is an only sporadically entertaining but beautifully shot piece of travel porn.",

It was the kind of film that expected it to be considered a sharp, witty, thrilling film with it's tension built up so well that the twist in the tale is cleverly concealed. However none of that is true. The acting was poor even though there were many great actors in the film and direction was even worse. Worst film of 2010 that I went to see.",
