The movie attempts to be equally sexist in both regards, as if that somehow makes things better. But the problem is that the men and the women are portrayed as sexist in different ways. Men are given the treatment of shallow and sex-fueled without making light of the fact or satirically poking fun at it, while women are painted as the shrews that Heigl accused Knocked Up of representing. Oh, and here's cinch, the movie actually says that the men are right.",

The only real flaw in my opinion is how predictable the movie is though. Like most chick flicks, five minutes into the movie you know exactly how it's going to end. The crude humor is somewhat fresh in the genre though, as it's more of a guy comedy style, so it's still worth a watch.",

      "text": "A formulaic romantic comedy that has a predictable plot and has a poorly weak script, that has a terrible message also is sexist. The script written by three women Kirsten Smith, Karen McCullah (Legally Blonde, She's The Man) Nicole Eastman, who know somethings about women and know nothing about men, they were going to make an unpleasant man character, that men couldn't relate to, but they were too dumb to realize that all men could agree with Mike Chadway, it's like they meet a douche bag guy and thought: Hey he's really mean and sexist, so this how all men are and let's make a movie about it. You can't expect anything really it's just a typical average Katherine Heigl movie, where she always plays \"the good, like able girl\" and how she wants a man, you think she known better after starring in Judd Apatow's raunchy funny \"Knocked Up\" but now she stars in a bunch of lazy rom-coms. In Sacramento, a TV producer Abby Richter (Heigl) is romantically challenged and can't a good man that fulfills her; produces a morning show that's about to cancel, due to it's low ratings. To increase the ratings, her boss (Nick Searcy) hires Mike Chadway (Gerard Butler) to host the morning show, Mike hosts the popular mannish show called \"the ugly truth\" were he talks about what men want in a relationship. Of course Abby doesn't think that her boss hiring him was a good idea, so she hates him because he's sexist and disagrees with his strong beliefs of women and dating. So she lets him help her get her dreamy surgeon Colin (Eric Winter) next door. So Mike teaches her how to flirt, how to dress, act sexually. The film is obviously mean't for dumb people, but the film didn't fool me. But the film is pleasingly glossy and snarly, also has perfect comedic timing not to mention sexy. The chemistry between Heigl and Butler is charming and humorous, Butler masterly does a well built job as this mean spirited character and Heigl is striking and good as always, not mention cinematographer Russell Carpenter captures Heigl's beauty stupendous. Director Robert Luketic (Legally Blonde) makes this rom-com glossy, fun and is gifted when it comes to comedic timing also does a fine job with cinematographer Russell Carpenter. Grade B+",
