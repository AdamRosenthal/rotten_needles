The film tells the story of what happens when Ethan (Alden Ehrenreich) starts having dreams about a mysterious girl called Lena (Alice Englert). When he meets her his life is turned upside down as he is introduced to magic and the rest of Lena's family, a mixture of dark and light casters intent on controlling Lena's decision of which side (light or dark) to join. Beautiful Creatures has one storyline, one thing propelling the story meaning it isn't complicated and it isn't hard to follow. It also means that this story requires a conclusion as it is the only possible story to conclude and if there isn't a conclusion the end of this film will not resonate and the film will ultimately lack any kind of emotional draw whatsoever. Well it turns out that the director felt an ambiguous ending would be more affecting than a conclusive one. He is mistaken though with the ending of the film making a mockery of a pretty decent love story and a film that has some good things going for it like good performances by the two leads and by supporting characters such as Viola Davis and Emmy Rossum. The cast look just as confused as I was when the finale came around as they muddle through pointless scenes designed to resolve nothing as the plot unravels and the film crumbles. For a film about a tragic curse and the decision of whether to be evil or good, Beautiful Creatures has no real stakes, neither of the two leads are really in jeopardy, in fact the action is always done in an almost comic way to lighten the melodramatic mood meaning any kind of tragic ending is not in the cards. It's ultimately garbage that in trying to provide a romantic ending have ruined a movie that had a decent melodrama, an enjoyable lead couple and some decent writing (until the end). It's a film that builds and builds to a climax that never arrives and therefore it feels like nothing happens at all making the entire experience forgettable and frustrating.",

Really only a few characters stand out from the rest and it is disappointing to see that their talent in acting may have been wasted on this movie. The plot was what was really disappointing overall however. From the beginning of the movie you may have difficulty following along and each event is hardly strung together. This movie would have done much better if the director had decided to break the movie into a possible two or three part series. While normally I would never want to see a movie like this be able to have a sequel, I believe that if it had then the cast would have been able to work on the story more and possibly progress into a movie that could have been at least decent.

      "text": "Clearly, \"Beautiful Creatures\" is aiming to fill the void left in the world following the conclusions of the \"Twilight\" and \"Harry Potter\" film series. Fantasy fans needing to sink their teeth into something new could do worse than this film adaptation of the first book of Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl's Caster Chronicles. Like The \"Twilight\" Saga, \"Beautiful Creatures\" adapts a young novel series and tells a story of teen romance with supernatural elements. Thus, comparisons are inevitable, and the studio makes the wise decision to open the film on Valentine's Day, the one day of the year when romance movies are not just tolerated but eaten up in theaters. Young love blooms between Ethan Wate (Alden Ehrenreich), a literati wannabe stuck in small-town Gatlin, South Carolina, and Lena Duchannes (Alice Englert), a visiting witch. Much is made of the two reading and quoting Kurt Vonnegut, Henry Miller, and the street poetry of Charles Bukowski. Lena is worried about being claimed by the Dark, so what should she do to avoid such a fate? Well, for one  and the primary concern of the plot here  she needs to stay away from the nonmagical \"mortal\" boy she's fallen for. Adapted and directed by Richard LaGravenese (\"P.S. I Love You, The Freedom Writers\"), \"Beautiful Creatures\" doesn't do the best job of storytelling. Late in the film, I was confused and surprised to discover there were two distinct villains, not just one, with the power to resemble others. That seems like critical information that should be spelled out more clearly than it is. Decently acted and nicely shot, \"Beautiful Creatures\" cannot sustain the intrigue of its opening and literature. It's warmed-over \"Twilight\", with witches instead of vampires, only the witches are called casters-- as in spell casters. When Lena hits her 16th birthday, she'll be called to fight with the light side or the dark side. It's a bigger yawn than it sounds. As supernatural types, Oscar winners Jeremy Irons and Emma Thompson overact so strenuously--and so outrageously awful with Southern accents- that you fear the damage this may do to their reputations. The movie feels longer than it is, and doesn't come together in a way that will engage many adults or kids outside the targeted teen demographic. That, mixed with the film's closed ending---suggests not much of a future for this franchise. Additional reviews at: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/member/Nesbitt10",

Besides better main couple acting we have laughing Emma Thompson, Hot-like-always Emmy Rossum- perfect for the role of main b...h, good dialogues(with some exeptions), everything in fantasy sauce......... that shouldnt be so diluted. Also Jeremy Irons could have more expanded role.",

      "text": "This film may relate to themes of the Twilight Franchise, but Beautiful Creatures is an amazing film. The story revolves around young, schoolboy Ethan and a witch or 'caster' named Lena. Leans 16th birthday is approaching and the day reveals weather Lena is being claimed to the light or the dark. Their love is powerful, but so are Lena's powers. Altogether, the film is a beautiful, love story involving suspense and secrets. Beautiful Creatures is the first of a trilogy, and I'm deeply looking forward to watching the next film.",

However, the movie is still quite enjoyable and a perfect genre for my liking (paranormal romance). On the other hand, the books, in my opinion, are better worded and contain a better ending than the film, as well as other aspects to the plot that were not included in the film, such as Lena and Ethan reading each others minds, the inclusion of Marian (the true keeper of the Lunae Libri), and Boo Radley (Lena\u2019s caster dog). Also, in the film Macon is a powerful caster when in truth, he is an Incubus and entirely different than the casters. I believe the inclusion of Macon\u2019s incubus form would have called for a better plot.",

I watched it and was slightly disappointed in the turn they wanted to take in the movie however that is the way it normally is with books made into movies. I believe if they got some better lead roles that the movie might have had a little bit of a better crowd behind it but i think the two did an amazing job in starting their career in this tough field of work where 1 out of millions hit it big. All and all look forward to the next movie and how they grow into their roles.",

I've read the books, and those were legitimately good (although definitely not the best thing I've ever read, too much romance and not enough focus on the plot). This is just a really mediocre film rendition of the book that tries to cram too much into a film's length and then ends it as unsatisfying as it possibly could. The first half is fairly promising but the added plot twists in the second half just kind of ruin it for me. I don't recommend this film, but if you want a better rendition of the story you should seriously read the books \u2014 they're not perfect, but good nonetheless. This film just leaves me wanting more.",
