I think the screenplay is Oscar-worthy, but I think the performances are actually a little too ahead of their time for the Academy to care about.

      "text": "Shortly after Tom Hanks was handed the Oscar for Best Actor at the 66th annual Academy Awards, the \"Philadelphia\" star launched into a hammy, but heartfelt speech that unavoidably, grows cornier and cornier, and less magnanimous with each passing year(wasn't a certain Laker supposed to die?), as the urgency which surrounded AIDS back in 1994, has leveled off considerably. Adrift in a complete state of beatitude, Hanks thanked his high school drama teacher, a man whose sexual orientation he promulgated to \"The Pavilion\" crowd, and the millions of television viewers around the world, including poor Rawley Farnsworth, Hanks' first acting coach. Hollywood scribe Paul Rudnick was one of those viewers, and in his ensuing screenplay, Cameron Drake(Matt Dillon), likewise, an Oscar winner for a gay-themed drama, does the same thing; he thanks a mentor from his formative years, and outs him. Frank Oz's \"In & Out\", starring Kevin Kline as Howard Brackett, a closeted educator, made fun of Hanks' speech for Jonathan Demme's \"Philadelphia\", while maintaining a safe distance from the issue at hand. But in \"I Love You, Phillip Morris\", all bets are off, as the Demme film itself, is parodied. Playing a gay conman, Jim Carrey, in a sense, channels Andy Kaufman, reprising his role as the performance artist in Milos Forman's \"Man on the Moon\". Like Kaufman, the rubber-faced Carrey as Steven Russell, never lets on that he's acting, and that the given situation, despite all appearances of being a genuine occurrence, is in actuality, an occasion to laugh. The 2000 biographical film faithfully recreated all of Kaufman's greatest bits, in particular, the feud that he waged against Jerry Lawler, inspired by the professional wrestler's annoyance with Andy's outright mockery of the \"sport\", in which the seeming misogynist would grapple women, in order to proclaim himself the \"World Inter-Gender Wrestling Champion\". He even had a belt. During an appearance on the old Letterman show, Kaufman, sporting a neck brace, was slapped out of his chair by Lawler, prompting the knocked down actor to unleash a litany of profanities, which ended with Andy throwing water in the much bigger man's face. Quite a few people took the incident at face value. In \"I Love You, Phillip Morris\", Steven fakes more than a broken neck; he fakes AIDS, and even though the film plays like a comedy, moviegoers may buy the disease, because they remember than nice Andrew Beckett, the deteriorating lawyer, played by Hanks in \"Philadelphia\". They accept the abrupt shift in tone; the jarring switch into drama, in what was a satirical comedy that sprightly moved along. In a previous scene, Steven breaks the foil on a lot of pills, and swallows them, causing him to OD, in the backseat of a squad car. If you understand that the pills are laxatives, and that Steven is mimicking the symptoms of the maturing HIV virus, and isn't orchestrating a suicide attempt, then \"I Love You, Phillip Morris\" has got you in a moral quagmire, because, for all intents and purposes, the filmmaker has got you laughing at AIDS.",

It certainly had its strengths and I even really liked some select scenes, but as a whole it didn't come across as a cohesive film. In fact, it came across as quite redundant and sometimes insincere. The one great strength, however, is Carrey's performance. Even when the film felt ingenuine, Carrey pulled through and provided an emotional center to what sometimes felt like emotionless scenes.",

It portrays stereotypes that have basically just become assumptions about homosexuals. If you want to watch a good movie about a gay male relationship, go for Brokeback Mountain. It is much more emotional, and much more tolerable as a whole, and it's a whole heck of a lot less offensive. Watching this movie, I have a harder time believing Jim Carrey was a gay man than I did believing he was God, The Grinch, or The Mask. Even Ewan McGregor, who I loved in Moulin Rouge and Trainspotting, was a blatant stereotype. If you ever wonder why homophobes think gays like to talk about the fact that they're gay all the time, they are promiscuous, as well as dirty liars, those homophobes are probably watching movies like this. It was also the least authentic romance movie I've ever seen. This was a less believable couple than Harold and Maude. This is in strong contention for the worst movie I've ever seen.",

Jim Carrey and Ewan McGregor are absolutely brilliant in this film as lovers. Together, they have a truly irresistible chemistry and their love story feels truly authentic here as both actors truly begin to embody their characters. The film's emotional high notes are entirely heartbreaking and watching Steven Russell destroy both his life and that of the man he loves, can be truly hard to watch, though ever entertaining given the comedic approach to the film. Overall, I Love You Phillip Morris has pretty indistinct direction and is not nearly as funny as it thinks it is, but all of this is alright in my book due to its highs. Those highs being the strong emotion in the film and the brilliant acting of Carrey and McGregor. Together, these two create pure movie magic.",

However this film was a pleasant surprise. It starts with the words \"this really happened...no really\" which raised the proverbial eyebrow over what was going to happen that was so unbelievable. As the film opens we see a very skinny Jim Carrey dying in a hospital bed, he then proceeds to tell us his life story. Normally I would find this irritating however due to the unreliability of the narration the rugged is pulled from under the audiences feet several times. The story seems so farfetched I am inclined to see how much is true given all the escapes pulled off. The romance between the pair seems believable enough and I found myself welling up at the end than laughing hilariously before the credits finally rolled Rating 7 out of 10 Quite funny with a solid story, though not for everyone",
