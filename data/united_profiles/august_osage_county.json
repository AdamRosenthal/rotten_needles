      "text": "August: Osage County is the film adaptation of the award winning play written byTracy Letts who also wrote the screenplay. Directed by John Wells and starring the extraordinary Meryl Streep, Julia Roberts, Julianne Nicholson, Juliette Lewis, Abigail Breslin, Benedict Cumberbatch, Dermot Mulroney, Ewan McGregor and Chris Cooper, this is the story of an extremely dysfunctional family and the problems each of its members bring to the table ( in this case the dinner table). Having seen the play on Broadway I can attest to the fact that the 3 hour play with 2 intermissions was so well acted and directed that it seemed to be only 2 hours in length. Conversely, the movie is only 2 hours in length but seems like it extends beyond 3. No one can quarrel with the words of the author and the tremendous talent on the screen but it just doesn\u2019t capture the intensity and tightness of the stage rendition. One can argue that Ms. Streep\u2019s character was too dramatic and \u201cover the top\u201d but the role played both by Ms. Streep in the film and by Estelle Parsons on the stage required that kind of \u201coveracting\u201d. The character they portray is basically a drama queen and both actresses captured her essence perfectly. A great ensemble cast  that could have benefitted more by better editing, I give the film an 8. Remember, the essence of any performance, be it on stage or in a movie house, is  good writing. For that reason alone, the film is worth listening to and watching.",

      "text": "Trite and uneven, AUGUST: OSAGE COUNTY may once and for all disprove Leo Tolstoy's very famous and over-used quote, \"All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.' This mess of a movie ladles out the usual American family dysfunctions without a trace of insight or depth. We've seen it all before, much better/much worse, in the theater, on film and hourly on television. Clearly there is talent involved from Pulitzer Prize winner Tracy Letts, who adapted the film from his own wildly successful and respected play, to a team of top producers who put together a star studded cast more for their wattage than cohesion. Meryl Streep leads the dysfunction while still overplaying the mother superior from DOUBT. Director John Wells is unable to reign her in or create any rapport among the actors. AUGUST requires a true ensemble, but with the film you never believe this is a real family. Julia Roberts comes out on top both in plot and performance but it really doesn't matter. She and everyone one else is done in by a film that really doesn't know what it wants to be. The cinematography is bright when it should be dark. The music sweetens when it should bite. Worst of all, the claustrophobia of the play is undermined with characters running in and out of the house like cracked up lab rats. This is not a work that needed to be opened-up. In fact, it needed to be closed in. Made more tight and claustrophobic for the screen. And when the characters do sit and stick around for abuse at the dinner table, you'll ask, \"Why don't they just leave again?\" AUGUST is truly a mess of a county.",

Julia Roberts, often too knowing in her roles, is fantastic here. In between all the fights and vitriol going around she shows great subtlety in some of the quieter scenes with her facial expressions doing a lot of the work. Margo Martindale also has a corker of a scene which propels an important plot point. In fact the women in the cast outshine their male counterparts by a considerable margin.

Lazily adapted to the screen by play-writer, Tracy Letts; the film is filled with dialogue that hardly translates well to the screen and a plot that doesn't have any room for subtext. Its certainly fitting that the blatant script was followed up with OBVIOUS performances; because the film was excruciatingly overacted. As entertaining as these performances may be on face value, there was really nothing take away from them. Every single nuance is acted in bold strokes; leaving nothing for the viewer to ponder. However, I must give it to Chris Cooper, for giving one of the few sincere performances in this picture. But that really couldn't save this film on a whole. At times entertaining and always easy to digest; the film was ultimately an overwhelming romp.",

Every person in the family has some secrets or vices and in lesser hands, it might feel like a soap opera. Some instances do feel like a soap opera, but a very watchable one. I actually think that this is a movie designed to make the viewer feel uncomfortable, right down to the laughs and the implication by the end that Julia Roberts' character may have become as bad as her mother played by Meryl Street. The big weak point that I see, as loathe I am to admit it because I like him, is Benedict Cumberbatch; I found his character a little too melodramatic, he disappears for almost the entire third act, and it's hard to tell if his southern accent is convincing or not. I'm hesitant to recommend this movie because I feel like it's an acquired taste and you won't walk away from it feeling joyful, but at the very least, I enjoyed it, so take that for what it's worth.",
