The problems the two encounter could befall any married couple so this is really not a gay movie but the story of a married couple who happen by chance to be gay. It is also the story of true love and the caring and affection that only beautful relationships can bring about.  Unfortunately, this lovely and sensitive story, told in a better way, would have made a better film. One can only blame the writers, Ira Sachs (who is also the director) and Mauricio Zacharias and/or the editor for preventing this movie from realizing its potential. The continuity and ease of understanding are significantly absent from the film so that the viewer must assume and imagine that which could easily have been shown in an added scene or two. This is even more disturbing when you have such fine performances given by Messrs. Molina and Lithgow and Ms. Tomei all of whom are exemplary in the roles they play. I give the film a 7 simply because too many questions are posed for the viewer to try to answer and too many inconsistencies exist for the viewer to follow. Had these writing/editing problems been solved, the film would indeed be worthy of a much higher rating.",

No.  I'm not an idiot; I appreciate movies that feel \"real,\" as if the viewer had dropped in to people's lives at some important moment.  But, these particular people?  Who cares.  Afterwards, my husband and I went to dinner and got hysterical, trying to make sense of what we had just seen.  Spoiler alert:  Why would Alfred Molina's character NOT know the details of his co-op mortgage and why would his real estate agent allow him to make such miscalculations in the sale?  Why don't these men have any friends of their own age?  Why would two people who just got married, split up, albeit temporarily, for ANY reason.  They could have become pet sitters for affluent out-of-town New Yorkers, for God's sake.  Why does an only child with no friends sleep in a bunk bed?  Why would two boys steal books in French when they could have taken them out of the Public Library?  And, WHY OH WHY would someone, whose life-partner has a heart condition AND one arm in a sling, stand and watch their beloved walk down steep subway stairs and go, by himself, back home, after having a drink?  Puhleeze.   AND, any New Yorker knows that a rent-controlled apartment cannot be handed over to anyone new, unless  they are a family member who has lived in the apartment for years and received mail there.  Building management companies watch those rent-controlled apartments like hawks, waiting for the residents to die so they can bring the apartment up to current value.  What the heck?  Do none of those details matter when writing a script?  And, as we sat there, my husband and I came up with a number of gay actors who could have played these parts.  Are critics too scared to negatively review a film about such a \"precious\" topic?  And, frankly, having known and loved many gay male friends, where were their outrageous senses of humor?  It would have kept this slow-moving film from being, ultimately, a complete downer.",

      "text": "Mike and I saw \"Love is Strange\" today at an early show in Evanston, and we think it's a great film that deserves all the great reviews it's been getting. It's a touching story of an aging gay couple who find themselves having to live with relatives and friends after the breadwinner loses his job as a music teacher at a Catholic school, because he made it public that he married his partner of forty years. Marisa Tomei's performance as the neice in law is a great performance. Alfred Molina and John Lithgow actually have screen chemistry because they are good friends in real life. The tenderness portrayed in this film is accented by the classical piano soundtrack. It's scares me that many people in the real world become desperate after losing their jobs, that this story comes off as almost true to life. Mike and I were touched by how gentle this couple is to each other. It's certainly a film about gay marriage that the American public should watch, if they only stop being so discriminatory to be more open minded. This is a great film, and I loved it like a great realistic novel where you get to know the characters, and care for them deeply. This is one great film!",

Well, it's definitely not an easy feeling to deal with but this beautiful love story shows us that having someone who you can trust and share your happiness and sadness is extremely important. Family and friendship is also explored, sometimes in a tough but honest way. Despite the lack of development in some characters, Love Is Strange has stunning performances by Molina and Lithgow and an unexpected ending.",

What the film lacked was clear direction, and was plagued with continuity problems (watch the black metronome on the piano during the lesson). Because of poor direction, the actors were all pouring themselves glasses of water and talking their lines. It's a shame, because the film had so much potential.",
