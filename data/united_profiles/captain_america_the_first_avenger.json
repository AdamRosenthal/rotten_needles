The CG effects are pretty amazing that sometimes it could be handy like creating worlds with atmosphere, instead watching CGI in people on their faces. The actor who played Captain America (Chris Evans) was very good and that's a perfect choice for the superhero. The characters are well acted and I enjoy watching that villain named Red Skull (Hugo Weaving) was dark and very cruelty that he did best villain as Agent Smith in The Matrix Trilogy. The background is neat and the visual looks amazing, of course that I didn't see it in 3D, but I recommend that see it in 2D if you can. Captain America is a solid summer blockbuster hit for the best comic book movie that could attach to my top of X-Men: First Class and more changeling than Transformers 3 that it didn't look too good (of course it stinks!), but very good.",

Through years of reading many comics, The Avengers was always my favorite and Captain America was always my favorite hero. Yes, I know they did a really bad movie in the early 90s of Cap, but given the budget and the plan to make the Avengers movie happen in continuity, I EXPECTED perfection out of this movie. They would NOT have been able to pull off any Avengers movie without a solid Captain America foundation. While Chris Evans definitely had the LOOK, I was initially concerned since he had very recently played Human Torch in the Fantastic Four movies. And, in my mind, him playing the immature Johnny Storm was much different than the responsible, mature Steve Rogers. Chris was absolutely perfect. The story was absolutely perfect. The cheese was minimal. The setup for the Avengers movie was perfect. People who have no emotional connection to the characters may find some of it cheesy, but Marvel, while not churning out dark masterpieces like DC is doing with Batman, this was everything I could have possibly wanted in a Captain America film. The Avengers trailer at the end put me over the top. My childhood coming to life on screen is mesmerizing. Excelsior!",

      "text": "Finally...an action hero that emblematizes more than an unwanted web-dweller, an opulent ecolocator, or fancied scrap metal; 'America' is the real deal! This latest film of the Star-Spangled Avenger is one that embodies a perceptible outpouring of nationalistic spirit and ardor, that draws from you, a rallying cry worthy of a few U-S-A-'s. The result, is a fanboy's dream, a new, improved look, and a comic-franchise-to-be, that just might become Marvel's next biggest thing. Think about it...What other comic film, after viewing, could you say made you feel proud to be an American? Zilch. Hey, and who knows, maybe with this country's ever-falling history test scores, a movie--this movie--of all things might be the cure; with Cap on your side, WWII might again be discussed and remembered. But, let's move on. So, you may be wondering: \"Besides the 'feel-good' affect of a potential franchise, and the revival of academic decadence, how was the actual movie?\" And I would tell you...\"Captain America: The First Avenger\" is the first of the historic 2011 summer blockbusters that aims to deliver on a textual basis, in lieu, of on a visual level; granted the visuals are far from peripheral. Farther, the 40's setting is a real delight to rivet in, as well. As for the acting...Chris Evans does a serviceable job as Captain Rogers, although, the 90 pound version is even more refined, and spectacular than the advanced CGI seen on Benjamin Button (2008). Hayley Atwell (Peggy Carter) also does a fine job, albeit, her presence is most known in the form of tightly-fit dress, showcasing her impeccable figure---she fits very well into the 40's dame picturesque. To my own surprise, is the real treasure in 'The First Avenger:' Tommy Lee Jones as Colonel Chester Phillips. Jones' stern, dead-set demeanor was to be expected, but his character brandishes more wit and charisma than other roles. More than anything, and what propels this film past all of the other of its genre---slightly more than X-First Stand---is its element of aptness of tradition; the feeling is conditioned within us. Captain America 'Wants YOU' to come to the theater!",

I knew the basics about him like he's in the original avengers and he originally lived in the 1940s and other things like that. That was actually a good thing because if I knew exactly what should've happened in the comics I think I wouldn't enjoy the film. The movie was good, even funny at times (Cap. America wasn't really funny in the comics I think), acting was nice and the story was pretty decent. There were times though where I felt it was a little anti-climatic. Like there was an action scene and the guy is in a live or die situation and while you wait for his fate it will cut to another scene talking about his fate but not actually showing it. But aside from other minor dislikes the film is good and is way better than the previous 'Avenger' film: Thor.",

There is room for improvement- namely, the super-villain organization, HYDRA, never, ever feels like a threat, and the declarations of characters that the villains are on the brink of taking over the world can at no point in the film be taken seriously.

The ending could've been a lot more emotional as well. I'm not asking for sobbing and ridiculous crying but if you actually think about what was happening, having some more emotion would've made it feel more genuine and authentic. Chris Evans is great as Captain America though. His role doesn't call for the darkness of Bruce Wayne or the charisma of Tony Stark but it does call for a certain level of confidence and straightforwardness and arrogance. Chris Evans hits all of those well. One of the few other weak parts was the villain. The Red Skull just wasn't all that terrifying or intimidating. Sure, he wanted to \"take over the world\" but nothing really made him uniquely evil other than his skinless head. All in all though, this was a very good movie and while it wasn't as good as the other Avengers films in my opinion, it is still better than most action movies around.",

So many of these super hero movies are modernizing things for today, and they didn't do that with Captain America. Second of all, Chris Evans... Third of all, they include THE COMIC BOOK in the movie - that basically puts the plot in real time, and comic book time, because the comic was INSPIRED by the true man. They wink to the fans by giving him his true suit on stage when he jokingly punches enemy, but make it more sleek and 'military' like for his real deal outfit when fighting in the movie. True wit - and I'm sorry, no backstory? Um, okay, he's a guy who wants to fight for his country and at first can't - he's helpless with women, his friend is a play - but all he wants is to be proud of himself and his country - gets an opportunity, and becomes the first avenger.

It explains the origin of Captain America and really brings you into his shoes and makes the viewers understand his views. The movie is loaded with action, supporting cast - Nick Fury's father, Tony Stark's father Howard, Bucky  and even Stan Lee which is a fun little thing to throw in - and interesting, intense story.

There are some pretty big plot holes. A lot of questions, and some things that are just too difficult to believe ruin any credibility that the first part of the movie had built up. How can Red Skull attach a perfectly realistic human face to his skull in the 1940's?...they can't even do a very good face transplant in 2011, yet Red Skull had a detachable \"Hugo Weaving face\" that just popped on and off like a Halloween mask...cheesy...bad writing. Then there's the mysterious \"blue cube\" which is never really explained...they just give the cheap comic book explanation  \"it's just a mysterious cube of great power, and we don't need to explain it because it's not important that our movie be believable or credible\"  cheesy...bad writing. Then there's the fact that Captain America has a shield that he can throw from great distances, and it always inexplicably returns to him like some kind of magical boomerang..no explanation as to how the shield does this...cheesy...terrible writing. Just because the shield can do this in the comics doesn't mean you don't have to explain it in the movie. Then there's the fact that Captain America crashes a plane into the icy ground and they just dig him out decades later and bring him back to life...and he hasn't aged a day  no explanation...we're just supposed to accept all of this terrible writing and not question it...sorry, Hollywood, I demand better quality from my movies and this will be the last super hero trash I see from you.",

I don't understand why Marvel made this Capt.

Now add some James Bond gadgets coming from nowhere and you have an invincible hero. Not that they at first have to fight enemies with \u00fcber-guns, they werent even surprised by what the enemy threw at them. Alas the bad guy could have saved the movie, but it was just too obvious that the impersonation of evil was played by \"Mr. Smith\" from Matrix: He looks like him, he acts like him, and even his metamorphosis to a red-skinned-something was just invented to pretend to have a real bad ass. In fact the bad guys act as stupid as the good guy and are nothing but cannon fodder. What was wrong with the fiction: Bad guy made through almost the same as the good guy to get his evil powers. Only difference one has a pure heart the other has not. Bad guy discovers a divine energy thingy but this does not help him either. It was just put into the movie to be able to make up some special FX with laser guns which would not have been common at the time the movie plays. The only thing needed for the good guys to block the special FX weapon is a shield from a metal which you never-heard-before and is indistructable. Funny thing: Its painting looks worn out after being shot at some times. So if you saw Matrix 3 and liked the movie because of the action, well this is what was good about Matrix 3. Cptn. Americas action is about a guy sneaking into an enemy base with a stars-and-stripes-painted shield - at least it wasnt glowing - and then beating up all enemies. Every 5th enemy is hit by the shield which behaves like a boomerang and returns to Cptn. America just in time to block the next blow. Btw. the only thing the Cptn. is afraid of is not the super powers of the enemy, nor the mysterious weapons which can dematerialize you within an instant when being hit, no, its flame throwers which make him duck and cover. At least: if you still want to watch the movie: look out for about its three funny scenes. Its not that its worth seeing them, its just makes you hope that there will be more.",

      "text": "Captain America was a watchable movie, thanks only to its campy/retro style and its mildly charming cast. The script was lazy and quite mediocre at best, with inconsistent dialogue, very little semblance of time and a plot that only skimmed the surface of what could have been achieved in this world war 2 adventure flick. In one instance; montages were used to show the captain and his team's earlier missions, rather than detailed scenes showing such missions (which was unfortunate). Such script weaknesses caused underdevelopment in both the story and characters. The score was perpetual and annoying, and the acting was okay (with the exception of Weaving and Jones who were quite good), but luckily; the simple character arcs and the romance between our leads, added a little to these 2 dimensional characters. The retro production of this movie won me over completely and its pulpy qualities were nice to watch as its hardly being done now. The comic book movies of this summer comes to an end, and I must say it was a pretty average group of movies (ranging from horrible to 'okay'). I may forever be baffled as to why this film got such good reviews. But its technical attributes are easily the best of the 4 comicbook films. but it surely wasn't the best, artistically.",

      "text": "Steve Rogers needs a bodyguard, somebody to save the WWII soldier wanna-be from running off his mouth, since the 4-F reject, five times and counting, is oblivious to the fact that his physique doesn't lend itself toward fistacuffs in back alleys with ignorant louts. A patrioteer, almost to a fault, the proverbial ninety-pound weakling pipes up when a heckler in the movie house, from Steve's point-of-view, has the gall to disrespect the GIs fighting overseas, as depicted in the newsreel, causing the proto-hippie to air his somewhat anachronistic disapproval over all that reality flickering in the dark. Due to Steve's unwavering jingoism and lack of prudence, the future Captain America ends up in an unwinnable fight against the apolitical one-reeler enthusiast(he likes cartoon), getting thoroughly thrashed amidst the garbage cans of the back street, until his best friend Bucky(1-H and set for deployment) intervenes, and defuses the one-sided altercation by matching the assailant's brawn, inch by inch and pound for pound. Steve just doesn't know when to quit, egging the stranger on with the claim that he \"can do this all day,\" like a martyr for all the 4-F rejects of his generation. This misplaced confidence can also be found in Homer Hickam at the outset of \"October Sky\"(directed by the same filmmaker), where the future aerospace engineer for NASA, as an unpromising defensive end for his high school football team, gets personal with a teammate on the other side of the line, calling him a \"son of a b*tch\", just before the bigger and stronger player serves him a pancake block. Sooner rather than later, Homer realizes that, unlike his older brother, he will never become a football hero, because some body types just aren't cut out for the game's collisional wear and tear. Instead of gridiron glory, he answers his true calling, rocketry, affording this small town hick the means to escape a lifetime's servitude in the West Virginia coalmines, when he represents his friends at a national science fair, capturing first prize, which he then parlays into a college education. Conversely, Steve, by all appearances, has no such backup plan. In his mind, it's the war or bust, so a little human alchemy, as proposed by Dr. Erskine at the Chicago World's Fair, isn't going to frighten off the twerp, whose drive to serve his country knows no boundaries. Outfitted with a sarcophagus before the army's brass, Steve allows the German doctor to inject his body full of serum, which has a steroidal effect on the musculature, giving him a competitive advantage over the other soldiers. Neither mutant nor an alien being from a distant planet, or for that matter, a man transmogrified by accident, Captain America is unique, because his superpower, the product of government-sanctioned medical experimentation, has a regimental quality that makes him, potentially, menacing to the world at large, who may view him as a living symbol of tyranny, once you reallocate the forties-era relic to the present, as this film does. Abridged from \"Rocket Boys\", the best-selling memoir that \"October Sky\" is adapted from, lies the fact that Hickam volunteered for a tour of duty in Vietnam(a full two years before the draft), whereas \"Captain America\", as well, circumvents the unpopular war too, diverging from \"The Avengers\" mythology, in which Steve wakes up from suspended animation during the ongoing skirmish in East Asia, and becomes something akin to a conscientious objector. Even though, through Captain America's eyes, the largely faceless Vietnamese lacked an iconic figure like Adolph Hitler to hate, he still needed to fight, since the Marvel Comics creation, in effect, during the Second World War, was Uncle Sam transliterated into pulp terms, recruiting men for active duty(in the film, the sloganeering is largely implied, trumpeting instead the savings bond at USO shows), or in other words, sentencing them to die, having been indoctrinated by propaganda through comic panels, long before the old man with the goatee pointed his finger at \"you\" in the real world. Using sports technology as an analogy for eugenics, it's ironic how Hickam makes it to Vietnam(not the NFL) on his own merits, whereas in the film, the super-soldier sleeps throughout the entire protracted ordeal. Differing from his comic book counterpart, who no longer sees America as a shining bastion for democracy, this filmic curio from the Eisenhower days is in for a shock, when Nick Fury briefs him about the intermediary steps leading up to our country's present-day complexion. No longer are there clear-cut good guys and bad guys, like the avengers in \"My Bodyguard\", where in the penultimate scene, the smallish Clifford(but bold like Steve) and Lunderman immobilize Moody and his hired goon Mike, in a public park. It's not 1941, or even 1979, anymore. The United States is Matt Dillon and the kid from \"Meatballs\" all rolled up in one.",

      "text": "Captain America is a fairly standard Marvel origin story, but on the more competent end of the origin story scale along with Iron Man rather than the incompetent end with Ghost Rider. It's got all the entertainment you've come to expect from Marvel summer blockbusters derived from slick storytelling, creative action and a sprinkling of humour. What lifts Cap up above the rank-and-file is it's satire of wartime propaganda and patriotism. Easily one of the strongest sequences is when the Cap receives his first mission, not action scene to test his newly acquired powers as one might expect, but a song-and-dance tour to keep American hearts and minds (and wallets) in support of the war. The film does have drawbacks - not least of which is a common one amongst superhero origin stories, that is to say a pretty rubbish villian. Poor old Hugo Weaving does his best as really nasty Nazi Red Skull, but does little but scheme and gurn behind a big red face. That's what the villain in an origin story has to do, unfortunately, merely provide enough of a challenge to create spectacle, but not be too difficult for the hero to best - it's only the first chapter in their story afterall. The Cap's other chief problem is really Marvel's - rather than dedicating a whole film to introducing one of their biggest stars, they chose to share the runtime between Captain America and the origins of the Avengers, hence the title: The First Avenger. So it's part origin and part prequel to next year's super-fantastic-wonder-team extravaganza. Dispite these drawbacks, the film is still very, very fun. Some nice action, effects and humour keeps the film moving, and Evans makes a likeable protagonist. It really is quite an achievement to make such a goody two-shoes so likeable, the Cap really has always been quite a bland character (not a personality defect in sight!) maybe it's just Evans' effortless boyish charm. Stanley Tucci, Hayley Attwell and Tommy Lee Jones in usual authoritarian grouch mode, in addition to Alan Silvestri's big, brash and brassy score also add to the quality of the film. So Captain America is a perfectly decent period superhero flick, and you're sure to have a good time watching it. It's not exceptional, but that's mostly because origin stories rarely are, and Marvel just seems to want to pack everything they do at the moment with knowing fan-boy nods to The Avengers.",

Against that sample, Captain America: The First Avenger does alright. The film appropriately takes place in altered World War II era in the US (presented largely Art-Deco style, think Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow toned down a few notches). I found the first 30 minutes of the film was the best it had to offer. It made me feel like this may be something special for the genre, but it quickly transformed from the a drama to a non-stop action flick that lacked much substance (perhaps bad editing).  Overall I thought it was well cast (although this is one of Tommy Lee Jones worst performances), it's just sad it turned into another comic action-flick which seemed to kind of chug along to get to it's final destination to setup the 2012 superhero composite film, The Avengers. In fact, the audience gets treated to an Avengers teaser at the end which seems to be positioned as more of a continuation of the story started in this film. Once that film makes it release, Captain America: The First Avenger may be viewed as sort of a part-one of something bigger. Having said all of this, I enjoyed Thor (released earlier this year) a great a deal more. Captain America would probably be my least favorite of the Marvel films released so far, save for the unnecessary sequel, Iron Man 2.... If you've enjoyed the other Marvel films, you're in for something different with this one and you probably will enjoy it.",

      "text": "One word: Hugo Weaving!  Weaving's spectacular turn as the Red Skull definitely makes Captain America worth viewing.  He is officially an actor who exudes acting perfection when on screen.  Some fans who are familiar with Chris Evans' turn as the Human Torch in the Fantastic Four movies may also want to take a second look at his acting prowess and stage charisma as Captain America.  Evans is no longer the exasperating wisecracking sidekick.  Evans captures Captain America's palpable candor, untouchable honesty, and magnanimity.  Captain America is a Baby Boomer's boy scout, and Evans plays it to a tee.  The film's story could use some development, but I'm suspecting that the film makers learned that comic book movie fans generally don't go in for long-winded dialogue and expansive character study (ala The Return of Superman).  The audience is treated to a brief development of Steve Rogers' character, then it's off to the races as Captain America battles the dark forces of Nazism.  Overall, \"Captain America\" is a great movie for a mixed crowd.  For those not very familiar with the character, the brief development and fast-paced action makes for an enjoyable ride.  For those die hard Cap fans, the director is careful to pay homage to the Golden Age of Captain America, while setting the stage for the larger frame of the \"Avengers\" movie.  Be sure to keep your seat until after the credits roll.  An extended \"Avengers\" trailer awaits those who are patient.  My vote: 7 out of 10 for a solid comic book flick.",

The movie was not all bad, The main actors were quite pleasant due to good casting, except Evans. He looks perfect but his corny one liner jokes don't fit with him being Captain America.  This is largely due to the director not having a clue.  All of the scenes that were not super heroish, that were made to look like the early 1900's were great! The cinematography was not bad but suffered from lasers. Really bad lasers. It was like \"that scene looks really nice, ..wait...no...noooo...stop....stop it...why are they shooting lasers? and why do they look worse then the lasers in the GIJoe movie?\"  The movie all in all was a good home rental but should have been at least an iron man level movie but came no where near.",

Hugo Weaving is also excellent as the villain Red Skull, the rule is put Hugo Weaving in a villain role and it will be awesome, For Instance Megatron in the new Transformers movies, Agent Smith in the Matrix films, Metal Beak in Legend of the Gaurdians, or even the good guy V in V for Vendetta. He pulls off the accent for the character well and does a fantastic job in his dialogue and his backhanded nature. Now I will give a warning that the film is not very entertaining for about the first 30 minutes, but when Captain America gets his suit on and his shield it becomes one Badass film. The action is what steals the show for me, it is fantastic and exhilerating to watch. The ending is ppretty much the same as every other marvel movie lately but I was surprsied to see a Trailer for *Spoiler Alert* The Avengers at the end of the film. So If you are looking for an entertaining action film for this summer don't pass this one up.",

      "text": "This film had a lot of hype to live up to, which can explain to some degree why I was thoroughly underwhelmed with the finished product. There are, however, other more significant elements in the film itself that ensured it would always fall below expectations, the most obvious flaw being the lack of a 'race against time' element. The viewer can expect a lot of action, which is extremely well done and has become what we expect of Marvel superhero films recently, but it becomes wearisome and it is not until the final stages of the film that the viewer can enjoy a suspense-fuelled action sequence. This is as good as the film gets. To reach this point though, the viewer will have to endure a slow-pace mid-sequence, in which the director succumbs to cliche filming techniques such as montages to keep the film moving forward but failing to engage the viewer effectively. Hugo Weaving takes on the role of Red Skull, a role which I feel could of been better performed by a different actor, not that Weaving performed poorly, but that the accent he donned for the role (a quasi-German/Russian) was at times laughable and took the audience completely out of the story. We also a large stock of typical characters that are almost universally used in action; there's the strong-willed female love interest (Atwell); the hard case military commander (Jones); and the ill-fated best friend (Stan). Although all of these characters are pulled off tastefully, particularly Atwell, it is somewhat predictable. The film is hampered further by a poor soundtrack, a petty point, but a good soundtrack should be a given in such a high-profile and high-budget film. For the avid comic book film fan such as myself, there are moments in Captain America that will undoubtedly have you sitting on the edge of your seat; very well delivered cameo appearances, a screenplay and plot that does the comic book justice, and a feeling of more to come. This adaption of a Marvel hero is nowhere near the standard set by other releases such as Iron Man, and can arguably be seen as the weakest release by Marvel Studios. That does not necessarily make Captain America a bad film, but it does mean that it is missing a lot. There is nothing to Captain America as a film that hasn't been done before, and nor does it do it better.",

He's a lot like Superman where he's basically the embodiment of good... and well... that's about it. The movie runs into this problem. How do you make a good movie when your hero is simply a patriotic do-gooder? Well thanks to Chris Evans' performance and a script that has fun with the material, Captain America ends up being a superhero movie full of fun and excitement, even if it doesn't quite overcome all of its obstacles. The movie's strongest element is its pacing. The screenwriters smartly focus the movie's running time on how Steve Rogers becomes Captain America which is the most interesting part of the story. When it comes to the development of the romance between Rogers and Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell) and Captain America's mission to take down the Red Skull, the movie breezes on through like a WWII highlight reel. There is a more drawn out action scene where Captain America has to rescue Allied prisoners, but the filmmakers seem to realize that once you see Captain America take down one group of Hydra soldiers, you don't really need to see it again. The movie does get a little too cheesy for its own good, but unlike \"Green Lantern,\" the cheesiness only hits for brief stints, and I mean come on, it's Captain America. That's practically a recipe for cheese right there. The only real problem \"Captain America\" faces is its less than fascinating hero. He's so purely good that every choice he makes turns out to be a predictable one. Like I said before, the filmmakers handle him well, but there's only so much you can do with the character.",

It is a well known fact, that while I'm a Science Fiction fanatic, I hate superheroes and comics. I wanted to see Captain America though, because I'm fascinated by the Avengers. I really can't see how all those big stars are going to work together, so I wanted to see all the films leading up to the Avengers, so I could follow along. Tommy Lee Jones, one of my favorite actors of all time, is one of the stars of this film, and I know he won't sign on to do just anything, so I knew that Captain America would at the very least be watchable. The more and more I got into Captain America, the most surprised I was by it's realism and honesty, it's not just the story of another superhero and how he's going to fit into the Avengers, it's the story of a very likeable character who wants to be something more than he is. I also loved the fact that this film took place in the 1940's as opposed to the modern era, because it gave a uniqueness to the story. I didn't feel like I was watching another Superman or Batman type of movie, I was really seeing something unique. The cast was fantastic, Chris Evans in particular, I don't know where the people who do the casting for these movies keep finding these guys, but each newcomer is better than the last. Captain America is unique and doesn't feel like a superhero out of some comic book. Comics are often based in extreme fantasy and appeal to those who want to escape their reality. Captain America was different though as he choses not to runaway, but to continually better himself, making him a uniquely remarkable character and it's those qualities that helped make a unique and remarkable film.",

Chris Evans does a great job of portraying Marvel's first fictional superhero/Steve Rogers. Plot: Steve Rogers is an American citizen within the year 1942 during WW2. He is dedicated to serving his country yet doesn't have the right physical build to enlist as an American soldier. When Dr. Erskine (Stanley Tucci) realizes that he is dedicated to his country he gives him a chance and changes his life forever when he gives him the chance to participate in his super soldier program. However, while Dr. Eskine was in Germany perfecting his super soldier serum, Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving), the leader of Hydra, a subdivsion of Hitler's army; becomes interested and forcefully injects himself with it becoming the unnaturally strong, and evil Red Skull. Schmidt also finds the tesseract, a blue glowing cube capable of unlimited energy. Schmidt uses this to evolve his weapons at an unreasonable rate posing bigger threats throughout the war. As Rogers becomes Captain America, he sets out on a campaign to end Schmidt's reign of terror as part of his duty as an American soldier. Opinion: believalbly set in WW2 with a great blend of fiction throughout reminds the world how terrifying WW2 really was, and that hope could be found even in the darkest of times. Well done, I reccomend it for anyone involved in WW2 and for those patriotic to America, I also reccomend it for anyone who wants to introduce themselves to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",

I mean for gods sake he's CAPTAIN AMERICA. The action was pretty nice but that was my biggest disappointment. The movie just rushes through most of the action, treating it almost like a montage, except for  a couple of moments. I personally think they should have made this movie like Tim Burton's Batman, where you find out Cap's past in flashbacks. That way they could cut, like, 25 minutes from this movie and replace it with more dynamic action. Maybe something like Cap running 469 yards to the Red Skull while simultaneously demobilizing 5 tanks, knocking down 800 solders with his shield, maybe even go downhill and surf on the shield, all while being fired at by 39 HYDRA airplanes.

The CG effects are pretty amazing that sometimes it could be handy like creating worlds with atmosphere, instead watching CGI in people on their faces. The actor who played Captain America (Chris Evans) was very good and that's a perfect choice for the superhero. The characters are well acted and I enjoy watching that villain named Red Skull (Hugo Weaving) was dark and very cruelty that he did best villain as Agent Smith in The Matrix Trilogy. The background is neat and the visual looks amazing, of course that I didn't see it in 3D, but I recommend that see it in 2D if you can. Captain America is a solid summer blockbuster hit for the best comic book movie that could attach to my top of X-Men: First Class and more changeling than Transformers 3 that it didn't look too good (of course it stinks!), but very good.",

This is set in the time of World War Two when America is trying to fight a sub operation of Nazis called Hydras and only Captain America can stop them. The origin in the comics lacked any kind of emotional impact but that has been fixed with the film rendition with Captain America played by Chris Evans. He adds a sense of humanity to the good Captain which was lacking in the comics and he is the perfect representation of the American Ideals. The beginning when Steve Rogers was a weakling gave way to some impressive computer effects. As is typical of a Marvel production, the strongest point is the interactions with the characters especially his relationship with Agent Carter and  Bucky Barnes. Hugo Weaving plays a great rendition of the Red Skull as once again he represents the hero's polar opposite. It is a battle against Allies freedom vs Axis tyranny. Those who are history buffs might be disappointed since it barely talks about the politics of the war but it is really a summer block buster which was meant to be a fun time. This is not \"Saving Private Ryan\" here. The film has some impressive action scenes and it even plays around with the idea of using Captain America as a tool of propaganda who evolves into the war hero he was meant to be.The best scene in the film though was the ending after Captain America was wakes up after being frozen in ice. The way the sequence was shot with long takes, the 360 spin, and some medium close ups conveys a sense of loss when he realizes that he is no longer in his time. This film is definitely worth checking out.",

Hugo Weaving put on a good villainous performance but I just wish his character had a little more development and more purpose in his actions as the Hydra leader. The WW2 setting is shown brilliantly in this film, and even though it can be slightly clich\u00e9d at times, it\u2019s a good type of clich\u00e9, comic book film clich\u00e9. This film overall works great in the origin story department, but the thing with these films is that they are forced to introduce the character and that can sometimes limit where the story branches. So all in all, this film is made purposely for the introduction of the first avenger, to set up many greater stories to come. I\u2019m going to give Captain America, The First Avenger an 86%",

I enjoyed and appreciated this movie very much, It's definitely an old fashion hit though. Chris Evans did a truly nice job as Steve Rogers/Captain America, as did Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter, loved their dynamic. P.S. the shield throwing was awesome!",
