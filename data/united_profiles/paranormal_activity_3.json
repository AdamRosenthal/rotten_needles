This one waits over an hour to have anything happen, has one of the worst set designer/wardrobe combinations ever, (wasn't it supposed to be in the 80's?), and moves into ridiculous territory for it's ending. Typical of Hollywood's \"drive a good idea into the ground then kick it a few times\" philosophy of late. Save yourself the time and money.",

The Paranormal Activity series has taken the low-tech \"bump in the night\" approach and made it work for three films.  While I enjoyed it, I believe this is the weakest of the three.  While it is gifted at building tension it doesn't provide as satisfying a payoff as the two previous films.  The story also gives very little attention to the reason behind the mayhem.  I would have preferred a more complete explanation for all the bumps in the night.  Even with these complaints, Paranormal Activity 3 is far better than any of the Saw films and 99 percent of all the other so-called horror flicks.  That's why I gave it a 7.",

      "text": "Before I get to the substance of my review, I have to describe a fairly shocking incident that occurred in my theater just a little while ago - the first Thursday night, 10pm showing in Santa Monica. And this no B.S.  About 30 minutes into the film, just after the subtitles read \"Night 13\", a young guy sitting 2 rows in front of me started groaning/yelling.  He was in a group of six - looked like a triple date - and they had been fairly squirrely up to that point, so I assumed he was just playing up the tension as people are prone to do in horror movies - testing each other and themselves. I suppose it's easier to laugh than to give in to the fear. Turns out it was the onset of a full-blown seizure.  People started bounding over rows to help the guy brace himself and the lights came up - he didn't stop shaking for about a minute.  He apparently had no history of seizures - which is what he told the firemen after he came to.  His friends were blown away, and the packed out theater couldn't believe it. Could the tension from the film have caused or contribute to it? I have no idea.  The firemen were asking a lot of questions about drug use - the friends were confident in ruling it out. (Personally, he didn't seem like the type, but what do I know?) It made the rest of the film a little creepier knowing it could have a physical effect on someone... So after a 20 minute break in the action, they started the film again (and gave us all free tickets for another show). There was some good-natured daring of each other to sit in that kid's seat for the rest of the movie - no takers. So, was the movie as good as the first two?  I'd say no, but it certainly was able to construct an entirely new sort of tension. The late-80s VHS feel to the thing was refreshing  My heart was racing for most of the last 15 minutes or so.  I'd give the \"experience\" of the evening about a 9, but the movie?  About a 6.",

I'll not drone on about camera technique, nor the type of medium used,(tho I will say the acting and direction of the two lil starlets in this piece was great :-D ). As most know this story chronicles the \"other worldly\" lives of two sisters but in reverse, the latest film being them as children. I did enjoy the first two,seeing them on DVD, but was hesitant to spend money at a large theater filled with whispers and cell phones when in a couple months I could watch it for half the price in the comfort of my home.My niece , however, also a fan of the scream screen, was desperate to the point of, \"I'll die if i can't see it opening night at midnight!!\", and it being R rated...I couldn't give her money and toss her at the mall while pausing in front of the doors, and go to Applebee's for a couple **** while I waited. So, being the dutiful Uncle I am, I grudgingly relaxed a little after work and grumbled up to the theater so she could see the premier. Once seated in the theater, the previews included a trailer of  a P.A. (Paranormal Activity) type movie involving a mental hospital and exorcisms with some very good special affects were played, adding to the normal tension associated with horror flicks in the the theater. The film began with no hoopla or credits, it was just there and playing. I could feel the anxiey n the place rise like a presence to a point where allmost all \"surprise\" in the film caused shrieks and giggles and I was bored already, but very soon...I developed a wickid lil grin. This was the best of the three, the screams from the audience were nearly defening and even young men were clenching so fast they came out of their seats and trashed anybravado they had shown coming in, while I was trying hard to watch the entire screen so I wouldn't miss any of the lil \"creepys\" that popped up. My 12 year old niece in the mean time went from a state of interest, to fasination, to mild fear up to an occation \"freak-out\", (baring in mind she' a BIG fan of \"the Grudge\" tp the point of knowing all the characters and watching the japanese version \"Ju-on\" as well as \"The Ring\" and the \"Saws\" franchise)but thats the point of going to these things in the first place. I was her age when the original \"exorcist\" came out and, like her, I was looking in the shadows and searched every room when I got homeand even having the light on was only minor comfort,( noooo Im NOT mean...she wants to see it again by the way) Long story short, ( to late),this is a must see film worth admissionlike a good roller coaster it should make you walk out going \"HOLY CRAP\" or it's just another day. ;-P......P.S.  I don't like the way this format does corrections",

Even so, I have become trained enough by the first two movies that when I saw this one I already knew exactly when surprises would occur, which goes to show that PA3 really should have done even more to differentiate itself from its predecessors. It tries to explain some of the backstory to give a reason behind everything that happens in the first two movies. However, it only goes so far in this as to allude to a witches coven, which is a disappointingly flat and uncreative twist that failed to serve the atmosphere of the series, and made me wish that the writers had just left it unexplained, because the PA series is one that thrives on the unknown in the first place. But even with these misgivings, PA3 is still a hell of a lot more effective then basically all other modern horror movies. If you have never seen a PA movie before, I do recommend this one (the plots of the three movies are independent enough of each other that they can be watched in any order) because it at least understands how to go about scaring someone, which cannot be said for any other series, and that alone warrants a score above average.",

Wheres the mom getting pulled back into the bedroom? Wheres christie splashing toby with water? Ive just listed 6 of the best scenes from the trailer that werent even in the film! Theyve cut off most of the movie and the best parts. This is very frustrating and annoying, this movie couldve been a thousand times better. There was yet another abrupt ending that made no sense. Seems as thoughtheres alot of plot holes. They didnt explain very much of what katy and christie said in the first 2 movies. I dont know why but i was pretty scared throughout this movie but im bery confused and frustrated now that i think of all of the disappointments. Very frustrating but if you want cheap thrills then go ahead and see it but yu will be frustrated if you think about it. 4/10",

How many of these camcorder films have actually been successful? ...and don't you get just the slightest bit nauseated by the constant movement of the camera? I guess that's for you to decide, back to the film. In the third installment of Paranormal Activity, we learn what happened to Katie and her sister when they were little. To be honest with you, I was pretty into this film until the last twenty minutes or so. Without spoiling it for ya, lets just say the story takes a dramatic turn away from the storyline. The result of this is that the overall story isn't as creepy and really doesn't make as much sense as it should. Paranormal Activity was never that scary to begin with, the film plays on the audience by having things suddenly jump out at them, but the story itself has gotten far less creepier as the series has gone on. Part 3 and 4 do have different writer/directors and that may be part of the problem. The first one freaked me out, the second one was a little slow, but also did the trick, and this one really didn't scare me. They relied much more on making the audience jump than they did on scaring them with the actual story. Number three didn't stick with me for days afterward, the way one and two did. As for the cast, they were all newcomers and the little girls were absolutely terrific! This series has a way of finding newcomers who seem like they've been acting for decades. Paranormal Activity 3 is good for a few cheap jumps and laughs, but the ending was really disappointing, leading me to think less of this film than I do of the other two.",

I've been through a loooot of horror movies and games and this is one of the few series where the horror aspect is done in a way that it actually gets your heart pounding. Even though I enjoy the over-the-top-gory side of the spectrum, PA is a movie I would watch if I actually wanted to be creeped out. I guess you could argue that most of the movies nothing really happens until toward the end, but it's that whole build up period that I like the most about these. To see simple hauntings blow up into something dramatic and life threatening is a bit scary to me because I have been in plenty of situations where very weird, unexplainable things happen, just never had a camera ready at the right time (lols). But anyway, I appreciate the subtle approach to horror of these movies, and that they invented jump scares I haven't seen done before. I wouldn't go as far as saying the movies are brilliant masterpieces but they definitely change up the genre and do something other horror directors aren't.",

      "text": "The third film in the horror series is by far scarier than the second and scraping as scary as the first. 'Paranormal Activity 3' builds up very high tension and then gives us a big scare, it feels very fresh and original. The first film was simply a haunted house story with things going bump in the night, the second was the same. Now, with the third, we have new original scares, showing more of the demon, which works very well actually, and the bumps in the night are bigger budget and sometimes even a bit more scarier. The story is different, maybe not better, but on the same level as the original, this time we actually have a story that develops as we find more about the demon, links to the original,  and revelations from previous films. But there are its faults, many comment the last 15 minutes are its scariest, but I feel they ruin the film, they are extremely tense, but it feels like there should have been more, and it was short of a great ending it could have been. We leave having more questions than answers, and throughout the film we were believing we were going to get a great answer at the end, but we don't we just get a bigger question. Some of the believably of the film is not the best, but, overall, this is a very scary film and if you could give an 8.5 I would, because this is scary and has a great story, it just seems a little rough round the edges.",

It gives a little bit more mythology to the demon, which makes this one the most interesting of the series. Paranormal Activity 3 is definitely the flashiest PA movie. Like the second movie, it does go bigger but, still, its subtlety isn't totally compromised. A lot of scares are played out by a more interesting camera setup: the characters move the camera a lot more, and there's one camera that pans across the room, waiting to scare us when the camera moves back to the other side of the room. The last 15 minutes, like the previous films, is by far the scariest part, but the last scene in this one really reminded me of The Blair Witch Project, one of the scariest movies I've seen. Another particularly memorable moment was when two of the characters play Bloody Mary, and it's probably one of the best moments in the series. Paranormal Activity 3 doesn't disappoint, whether you're a fan of the series or not. It's a consistently scary and effective horror movie that keeps the surprisingly consistent franchise fresh.",

I saw the movie and i was like \"Where are the best parts from the trailer? This kinda feels really boring!\" That's the number 1 fail in this movie, that's the thing that totally let the movie down. And what's weird is that after the movie was done, i went home and slept like a baby. Seriously, this time it felt less scary and more boring than the other movies. So, overall the acting was fine, but they should've put the best parts from the trailer in the movie to make it less boring and more exciting and creepy. But, they didn't, and that totally sucks.

Kristi talks a lot to Toby, her \"imaginary\" friend.  Mom Julie (Lauren Bittner) is concerned, but stepdad Dennis (Chris Smith) is a wedding videographer so he knows how to set up cameras around their SoCal house to catch any mischievous ghosts in action.

Have something pop out in the dark. Wait for a scream. Then drag out the next surprise for an eternity. Repeat cycle. I expected better from directors Henry Joost and Ariel Schulman, who scored so high with Catfish last year. But one of their gimmicks is a doozy: Stepdad straps one camera to a slowly moving fan, which will have audiences craning their necks while producing a meager payoff.
