      "text": "IN MY OPINION **MAY CONTAIN SPOIILERS** by CtheTav This film grew on me from the moment I sat down to watch it. Going in I haven't seen any reviews or plot synopsis for this film so I had no clue what it was about. Turns out its the following. Richard Gere seems to have everything loads of money and a mistress on the side, a family who love him and success. It turns out this is all a lie. He's nearly bankrupt his company and needs the merger to go through to get away without anyone noticing. Add to this the fact that he has accidentally killed his mistress and needs to cover this up to get his company sold. Few what a week. This film ends on one of the best cliff hangers I have seen in years with Gere stuck between a rock and a hard place, but I feel the character is strong enough that the internet will be able to work out what he would most likely do, I know what I would do if I was him. The acting is excellent throughout the story moves along at a brisk pace meaning the 2 hours fly by. The story asks the question what you would do to save yourself. The writing was so good I found myself caring about Jimmy (an accomplice of Geres') and whether he would cave under the pressure. Rating 9 out of 10 A great thriller setting an example for others to follow whilst staying true to its roots",

      "text": "Arbitrage is a generic Richard Gere thriller that seems a bit unfocused and scattered, but somewhat comes together in the end. It's predictable, melodramatic, but the acting is pretty good, as many stars are in this one (Gere, Sarandon, Roth). The story veers off course in the middle parts and starts to get away from Gere's character, even though this was a path the movie shouldn't have taken. Overall, the film is average. Only watch it if you like Richard Gere enough.",

      "text": "Richard Gere's hedge fund magnate Robert Miller is a studied personification of post-2008 \"big finance\" excess and moral turpitude. The movie's point is a wearily familiar truism: there will be no justice for powerful rich people, regardless of the scale of their crimes. What debut director Nicholas Jarecki succeeds in accentuating - with the help of Gere's perfectly judged performance - is the role that charisma and intelligence, rather than just naked economic power, play in maintaining this depressingly destructive cycle. A terse and effective thriller with an excellent supporting cast including Susan Sarandon.",

However, once all the pieces fall into place, it's actually a very satisfying story. The main character is definitely not an perfect guy, but he has some surprising good points.",
