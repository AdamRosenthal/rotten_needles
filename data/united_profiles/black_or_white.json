We do get good supporting work from Anthony Mackie and Mpho Koaho along with some compelling courtroom scenes. However the movie is too sentimental for it's own good, it's too long and gives the most anticlimactic ending to any movie I've seen so far this year. Finally don't even get me started on Octavia Spencer who gives the most over the top performance of her career, she was kind of awful.",

I also love Octavia Spencer in just about anything she is in, and puts in a great performance as the Grandmother!  The dialogue and script in this movie and life lessons should leave us all with something to think about.  This movie is so well acted and put together, and reiterates things that having great parents taught me early on in life about family, race, and what is right and wrong.  In the end it teaches us all what is most important.",
