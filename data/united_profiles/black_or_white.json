I also love Octavia Spencer in just about anything she is in, and puts in a great performance as the Grandmother!  The dialogue and script in this movie and life lessons should leave us all with something to think about.  This movie is so well acted and put together, and reiterates things that having great parents taught me early on in life about family, race, and what is right and wrong.  In the end it teaches us all what is most important.",
