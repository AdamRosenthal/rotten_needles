It just goes to show (as if we didn't know) that Hollywood can turn anyone into a philistine. It was interesting to see Jane Fonda show such a commitment to her character, even when that character is a characterture (in fact, a characterture of her own youthful characterture, hence a meta-characterture). Not a great job of acting, but an impressively unselfconscious performance nonetheless. On the plus side, Elizabeth Olsen confirms the fact that even in an underdeveloped and stereotypical role she has a great movie presence (and is more than a credible actress). On the other hand, Jerry Garcia must be turning over in his grave (he was buried, wasn't he?) at the surfeit of tie-dying in this movie. Finally, the most egregious sin of the movie is the underlying Hollywood \"lesson\" that \"romance conquers all\"-- substantive political differences, bad parenting, bad hair-dos, everything is secondary to romance. And here I was trying to find the meaning of life in Nietzsche, Marx, Sartre...and it was all there in a Beatles lyric. \"All you need is love\"!",

City people meet tie-dyed, small town inhabitants.....with indoor chickens.... surely this is hilarious. IT is not. I gave it a three for nice scenery and reasonable photography.",
