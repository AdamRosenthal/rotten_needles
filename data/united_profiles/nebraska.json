Payne himself is a Nebraska native who felt strongly that the movie be filmed black and white to capture the mood of the old American heartland, and in order for the film to receive funding from Paramount, he had to settle for a smaller budget. As a result, Payne films and casts the movie in local communities with actual residents which provides a realistic texture to the family bonding tale. \"Nebraska\u201d is a humorous and heart-rendering story of family, but it also sheds a light onto the people of America's heartland, and our countries economic, moral, and cultural decline.",

Every scene transition has half a dozen of these \"get it?!\" shots--it's rather maddening.  There are two scenes in the whole move that SAVE the film: the compressor theft mishap and the final drive through town--both of which deliver the 'feel good' sentiment of the film.

The acting is great, led by great performances by Bruce Dern, June Squibb, Will Forte, and Bob Odenkirk, though really, everyone turns in a good performance here and really embody their character. This was the first film by Alexander Payne I had ever seen and I regret taking this long to start work on his filmography. The cinematography here is gorgeous and serves as the perfect backdrop to this one, as the camera really finds every inch of beauty in this rural setting and maximizes on it. The black-and-white is also a major plus for me, as it just seems to fit. Overall, this one is a story about a man's relationship with his aging father, who certainly seems to have lost a step over the years, but even then, they were never very close. However, when his father hinks he won a million dollars, they start getting closer and he learns more and more about his dad, bringing them closer together. Ultimately, this study of their relationship is entirely endearing to viewers of all ages and if it does not touch your heart, you better head to the doctor to see if you even have one. As a whole, Nebraska is a very good film with great acting, writing, and a brilliantly moving story.",

      "text": "In uno splendido bianco e nero (fotografato da Phedon Papamichael, greco dal nome spettacolare, gi\u00e0 con il regista per \u2018Paradiso amaro\u2019), Alexander Payne firma un piccolo capolavoro da una storia semplice, scritta da Bob Nelson, ma che scava a fondo nei personaggi. I Grant sono un\u2019anziana coppia disfunzionale, in cui lui, Woody, \u00e8 abbonato alla bottiglia e ha un netto disinteresse nei confronti dei familiari, mentre lei, Kate, pare impegnata in una lamentela infinita. Ci si stupisce che i figli non abbiano troppi problemi, a parte che il pi\u00f9 giovane, David, \u00e8 appena stato mollato dalla fidanzata. Un po\u2019 per distrarsi e un po\u2019 per provare a riavvicinarsi al genitore, David decide di accompagnarlo dal Montana fino in Nebraska sulle orme di una vincita milionaria chiaramente fasulla, ma sulla quale il vecchio si \u00e8 intestardito. Sulla strada, per\u00f2, c\u2019\u00e8 il paesello natio di Woody e Kate, Hawthorne, ed \u00e8 l\u2019occasione per un ritorno alle origini che coinvolge anche la madre e l\u2019altro fratello, Ross, ma che insegna parecchio a David sui propri genitori. Hawthorne \u00e8 una specie di buco del culo del mondo, due strade in croce in mezzo al nulla abitate perlopi\u00f9 da anziani malvissuti (e i giovani sono destinati a seguirne le orme, basti pensare ai cugini Cole e Randy) in una realt\u00e0 estremamente provinciale che offre poco - forse solo la strada per andarsene - per non dire nulla. La notizia del milione mette in agitazione la piccola comunit\u00e0 che vuole disperatamente crederci malgrado si tratti di una palese patacca. Di conseguenza, vengono rispolverati vecchi rancori e mai sopite rivalit\u00e0 \u2013 alla fine personficati in Ed, interpretato da Stacy Keach - attraverso le quali Payne pu\u00f2 descrivere una serie di figure disegnate con cura, mettendo in fila una serie di facce una pi\u00f9 azzeccata dell\u2019altra. In merito, ci sono almeno due scene memorabili, quella del bancone del bar con tutti gli avventori immobili con il proprio bicchiere e quella in cui i maschi del clan dei Grant guardano la partita dei Chicago Bears in televisione: due piccoli quadri di inquietante gotico americano. In contrasto con gli ambienti, non sempre in perfetta forma, di Hawthorne, ci sono i grandi spazi che circondano la cittadina, il cui fascino magnetico pare venir accentuato dalla mancanza di colore, specie quando i personaggi si muovono sulle strade bianche che collegano le fattorie sparse e che sembrano uguali a cinquanta o cento anni fa. Detto dello splendido contorno, \u00e8 per\u00f2 ormai ora di parlare degli interpreti principali, dai quali sarebbe stato impossibile pretendere di pi\u00f9. Lo scarmigliato Bruce Dern solo intravisto in \u2018Django unchained\u2019 \u2013 lunghi capelli bianchi svolazzanti e barba incolta \u2013 d\u00e0 corpo al testardo, fragile Woody con un\u2019andatura strascicata e una voluta sgradevolezza: davvero ottima \u00e8 l\u2019interazione con Will Forte nella parte di David, con l\u2019attore nato al Saturday Night Live che regge alla grande il faccia a faccia con il vecchio leone e rende in maniera assai sottile l\u2019evoluzione del suo personaggio, l\u2019unico per il quale cambia qualcosa. La vera rivelazione, per\u00f2, risulta alla fine essere June Squibb che, tutte le volte che \u00e8 in scena, ruba l\u2019attenzione con il nervosismo di una Kate che, senza peli sulla lingua, sembra voler scaricare nelle parole la durezza di una vita passata al fianco di un uomo che forse non ha mai amato (e viceversa). Trattandosi di un film che lavora sulle psicologie, il passo scelto da Payne \u00e8 inevitabilmente lento, ma di quella lentezza che aiuta le sensazioni a sedimentarsi nella mente dello spettatore, finendo per non abbandonarlo pi\u00f9: in ogni caso, un tale andamento \u00e8 lontanissimo dal generare qualsiasi sensazione di noia, anche perch\u00e9, pur trattandosi di una commedia amara, qua e l\u00e0 ci sono spunti comici costruiti con notevole abilit\u00e0, come, ad esempio, la ricerca della dentiera di Woody o l\u2019episodio del furto del compressore sbagliato. Il Nebraska \u00e8 lo stato natale del regista, ma \u00e8 impossibile sottrarsi alla suggestione di un altro capolavoro intitolato cos\u00ec (e, guarda caso, con uno scatto in bianco e nero in copertina): come il disco di Springsteen \u00e8 tutto meno che immediato, ma conquista senza lasciare scampo con le sue storie di perdenti, la pellicola di Payne richiede solo un po\u2019 di attenzione per trasformarsi in uno di quei film che \u00e8 difficile dimenticare.",

La puesta en escena, los actores (esa madre, brillante), la trama... Para nada es aburrida, no hagan caso a los que digan que es una pel\u00edcula vac\u00eda o sobrevalorada, es una obra genial y con bastante mas humor del que esperaba. Muy recomendable.",

He embarks on a trip from Montana to Lincoln Nebraska to collect the millions, untrusting of the post, with his son David in tow acting as his guardian. The entire movie is bleak, portrayed entirely in black in white, though that directorial choice by Alexander Payne is not necessary. Casting, acting, script, costume and set design suffice to convey a dreary lower middle class existence. What starts as plot about a son attempting to take care of an unmanageable father quickly changes tone when they end up at Woody\u2019s hometown.",

      "text": "At its core, Nebraska is a touching and amusing film about a delusional alcoholic, played very well by Bruce Dern, whom believes has won a million dollars. This belief he holds throughout the film is what holds together its sentimental tone. However, just as Nebraska is shot in black and white, it also carries a comedic undertone to it that accompanies its more gloomier mood, which can arguably be credited to June Squibb`s performance as Dern`s judgemental yet hilarious wife. A performance that surprised me was Will Forte and his ability to draw out sympathy for Dern`s character. Not to be overshadowed by the acting department, Alexander Payne does a magnificent job directing Nebraska. He has a keen eye for creating the mood of the scene with the use of the music. However, when watching Nebraska, one can`t help to notice the set design. It does its job in drawing the audience into the film`s time and place, which really helps us connect with the characters, not that we weren`t already capable of that thanks to Bruce Dern`s Oscar worthy performance. I felt that the same music track was playing in the movie too many times, that it began to make my ears numb to it. Apart from being a bit too predictable and having a particularly slow middle, this movie does succeed in what it's trying to accomplish. Overall, Nebraska was a movie that was never too dramatic and never too comedic, it was just right.",
