      "text": "Extract is a pretty straight forward film. Directed by Mike Judge, Extract is a modern day comedy that has some solid jokes along the way, is not memorable in any fashion, and has a very dumb plot. There is certainly comedy in the plot at times, but Extract is the very definition of escapism. It is the furthest thing from a serious film and, though mildly entertaining in the moment, it is already beginning to escape my mind. With each passing word I type, I forget a piece of Extract's plot. That is probably not a great sign as to its staying power.",
