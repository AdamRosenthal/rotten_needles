From the drag-queen makeup on the ladies to BonJovi's red leather jacket that looked like it was from Brittany Spears tour circa 2002, then there's the plot and the writing...horrible. I stayed to watch because it was like a train wreck. I can write so much more, but I'll leave it at that. I guess I'm the biggest loser here because I paid to see it...but reader be warned.",

It's directed by Garry Marshall and features an enormous name-laden cast, including De Niro, Swank, Berry, Kutcher, Pfeiffer, Efron, Biel, Bon Jovi and Heigl. They star in multiple scenarios that revolve around the last night of the year and they all do a good job. The moviemaking is competent and the pacing never lags (how could it with so many stories?), but there isn't enough comedy and it tries to be too heartfelt. As a result, it's just busy and flat.",

It's made by the makers of \"Valentine's Day\" and director Gary Marshall (Pretty Woman and Runaway Bride) also screenwriter Katherine Fugate (writer of Valentine's Day) not to mention some of the cast members are in this, Marshall does a great job with making the film magical and glossy. It has some touching moments a few heartwarming scenes that's the only thing Fugate does right. It's New year's eve (the film's title)! In New York one night to promise love, hope, forgiveness, second chances and more. The mother daughter story: Kim (Sarah Jessica Parker) is a single mother she thinks her teenage daughter Hailey (Abigail Breslin) is a child, Hailey wants to do is go out with a boy named Seth (Jake T. Austin \"Wizards Of Waverly Place\") so she can kiss him at midnight. Hilary Swank plays Claire, who's in charge of the city's big tradition, the ball drop in Times Square something goes wrong so they get the grand Kominsky (Hector Elizondo who also starred in Valentine's Day) to fix it. The Ex's meet again story: Katherine Heigl plays Laura a chef who is cooking for a New Year's Eve party for a record company, she runs into her ex Jensen (John Bon Jovi)  who's a rock star performing at that the party. The New Year's resolutions list story:  Ingrid  (played by the great Michelle Pfeiffer) after almost having a near-death experience, quits her job at a record company, asks Paul (Zac Efron) a messenger to help her achieve her New Year's resolutions list. At a hospital, Stan (the great Robert De Niro) who is in the final stages of cancer, who only wants to see the ball drop, his nurse Aimee (Halle Berry) is staying with him, who is making sure he is okay. Giving birth on New Year's Eve story: Tess (Jessica Biel who also starred in Valentine's Day, what is this a Valentine's Day reunion?) and Griffin (the funny and talented Seth Meyers) a couple who are expecting, want to be the first after New Year because of the available cash price; but they have a competition when another couple (Til Schweiger and Sarah Paulson) who wants the money and is about to give birth. Stuck in a elevator story: Randy (Ashton Kutcher) not a fan of the big holiday because something happened is on an elevator with Jensen's back up singers Elise (Glee's Lea Michelle) are stuck on an elevator. Sam (Josh Duhamel) who is out of town, he is trying to get to New York, to find the love of his life he meet last New Years. I liked this movie the acting was good despite wasted, it has a few great stories. Grade B-",
