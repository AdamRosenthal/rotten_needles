The acting was terrible, none of the characters were likable, the plot was completely unoriginal and predictable, and none of the jokes were very funny. There isn't a single redeming moment in the entire film. Instead of watching this piece of crap go watch Superbad, Road Trip, Old School or any one of thousands of movies that have done this genre better.",

There are some laughs to be had in certain instances, yet some of the scenes either fail to raise a smile, or are merely disgusting. One such scene shows a character who has no penis, just a straw to pee out of. There is no need to actually show this, and it made me feel physically ill. The acting is largely solid, although Tucker becomes irritating quite quickly. All in all, not a horrible film but not one that I would recommend.",

The  time period managed to stretch all the way to 2009 with this disaster flick. One thing to note is that this film has a relatable main character and overall I think Craig Robinson was a bright spot in this movie; however, that is nothing compared to the generic characters and some of the worst writing I have ever seen. I honestly don't remember laughing once throughout the entire film. Just when you think it could not get more stupid, it does. The movie is gross and repulsive from beginning to end. Even though the lead is someone you can empathize with, there is no character development at all leaving a very drawn out and shallow cinematic experience. The acting is almost as bad as the writing (with the exception of Craig Robinson). The comedic deliveries are completely off as most of the acting is just stiff. This movie will make you want to take a shower after watching it, and trust me it is for the worst possible reasons you can imagine.",
