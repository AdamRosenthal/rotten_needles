This movie is geared for and will be enjoyed most by older movie goers who can identify with Cholesterol and PSA numbers versus baseball statistics and who can understand that phone calls from friends you haven\u2019t heard from in many years don' always bring happy news. Well directed by Jon Turteltaub with a screenplay by Dan Fogelman, Messrs. Douglas, De Niro, Freeman and Kline get a chance to display their comedic and dramatic talents while ably abetted by a sparkling and charming Mary Steenburgen, all while in the venue of Las Vegas and, more specifically, Binion's Hotel and the Aria Resort complex. Though the jokes may be old, they are delivered well and make for a relaxed and nice viewing experience. This is not a great film nor will it win many awards but it does give the audience an opportunity to sit back and enjoy the exploits of these senior citizens as they seek new goals, heal old wounds and cement quality relationships. I give the film a 7 and recommend it to all who believe that life doesn\u2019t necessarily end but can, in fact, begin over 70.",

Billy (Michael Douglas) is 70 years old and about to marry a college student. While he seems content with his new life, he desires one last vacation with his three best friends from the old neighborhood. Reluctantly putting aside old quarrels, the men meet in Las Vegas for Billy's bachelor party, and once things get going, these guys prove that they are anything but over the hill. It's hard to go wrong with a cast of Academy Award winners that have literally hundreds of films under their belts, but a film like Last Vegas really does come down to the writing. If it's not hilarious, in the eyes of the audience, the cast will seem as over the hill as their characters. Thankfully, that wasn't the case, as simply the chemistry between these guys leads to some hilarious moments, that I'd be willing to bet were completely unscripted. Each actor brings their own unique style and brand of humor to the part and when they finally come together in Las Vegas, this film takes off. It isn't an exaggeration to say that this is one of the funniest films I've seen all year. Just the guys reaction to the things associated with modern day Las Vegas, like the technology, thugs, rap music, and strippers is absolutely priceless. The ancient cast and a PG-13 rating turned a lot of people off to this film, but the cast is a complete throw back trapped in a modern party town, leading to some epic scenes. Last Vegas is an absolute comedy gem, that somehow fell under most peoples radars, but it is every bit as good as the Hangover was, and maybe even more so, thanks to the experience of the cast and their tremendous chemistry.",

I believe movies should do several things; have a great story: this one's story was not AMAZING but the background the characters had with each other played a huge part in the film's story. A good film should have great messages; this one had some of the best messages I have seen in recent films, something that actually made me feel so much better and just all around happy; and the film should be entertaining. The jokes were laugh out loud funny (I won class clown and my father is a stand up comedian, it's not easy to make me laugh) but the humor in this movie was great. Although older audiences might get more from it, it made me so appreciative to have my whole life ahead of me, and know that I will never be too old to have a dumb good time with my buddies. The film also captured Vegas pretty well, maybe not every aspect, but enough to the point where it made you feel like you were there. I'm sick of critics only giving good scores to these long boring movies like Gravity, or Prisoners, because it's \"more intelligent\" or whatever. Screw that, I would take this film over films like that any day, because this is what going to the movies is about; laughs, cries, heartbreaks, in this case some awkward groaning and moaning sounds (I was the only non-grey haired person in the audience) but this film did it's job.

All four of the main characters were hilarious and they all worked so well off of each other. It seems like they like they know each other pretty well behind the camera. Last Vegas is just a great buddy comedy. It doesn't matter how old you are.",

The production is simple, with a light and loose script, right music and correct cinematography. I think the director did not have to have had so much work with the cast, with a very strong quintet, each with his Academy Awards. Perhaps most surprising is Mary Steenburgen, great on the scene, but the leading quartet does not leave to be desired, even Morgan Freeman superior sense in several moments.",
