Talbert created a story about a woman ( Paula patton ) an how she tries to find a husband in 30 days before her sister weeding her key is the plane. that was not the answer  til the ending it does teach us human beings a lesson in true love but how Talbert shows love he may over done it by black a- fying it like Mr Perry but i am not gonna judge #still enjoyed it.
