Take for instance how the film almost instantly jumps right in and doesn't dish out a half hour dose of trite melodrama. Another note, how Michael Douglas surprisingly captures the role of madman Madec flawlessly. Not to mention the insane atmosphere our protagonist Ben has to run around in. It has amateur filmaking elements in it such as freeze frames and pan-zooming, but they are easily bypassed by the visceral feelings the film itself gives. Though flawed, Beyond the Reach is still a satisfying thriller that busts out almost everything one would expect by its description.",
