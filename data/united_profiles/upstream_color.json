Of course, it hasn't received anything like a diverse reaction.  There are currently 27 critic reviews, and not a single one is negative (at least to be judged by the color red).  That is odd.  Really odd.  And I don't think it's unnatural that a lot of users have questioned why that is.  There is obviously something that is causing reviewers to give this movie a pass.  It should at least be divisive, but not amongst the critics, I guess.  I like to maybe believe that it's because critics have seen so many movies that anything different is appreciated even when the different on display is not necessarily good.

This reminds me of \"The Tree of Life\" in how many reviews bloat a \"head-scratching\" plot. However, it's really not that difficult. The elliptical editing  similar to what Carruth achieved in his first, \"Primer\"  warrants more time to fully understand the plot, but it's by no means, impossible. After first viewing, it's a telling tale of deception and retribution, a complex story of theft while tracking down those involved (however loosely) and creating a life from the wreckage the deceit involved. It's worth the investment and is different from anything from a major studio you'll ever see  partially why it's self-distributed (by the director). Writer/director Shane Carruth, because of his stories' complexities and the depth at which his stories take viewers, including his willingness to self-distribute titles makes him one of the most important American directors  even with only 2 films under his belt. See this film, so you can watch again to fully understand the plot.",

When Kris (Amy Seimetz) is accosted by a mysterious stranger and implanted with a mind altering parasite, her ideal life is upended and the only thing that seems to return her to a modicome of normalcy is Jeff (Shane Carruth), a man who has been through a similar experience that she meets on a train. While the film does demand you fill in the films many plot holes with your own imagination, it isn't the same lazy storytelling technique that made Only God Forgives so intolerably stupid. The film sets a framework for the viewer, one that we must populate with our own thoughts, our own ideas about what it all means. Without our input and our sense of self this film wouldn't work. It's a special picture because no one sees the same thing or comes to the same conclusion. The connection Kris makes with this creature is a way of discussing not only the natural cycle of things on this planet but the concept of symbiosis, the coming together of two organisms and the bond the two form as they work with each other. This is something interpreted by Kris and Jeff's importance to each other but also through Kris' relationship to the parasite, something she cannot see but she knows somehow is there. Seimetz proves herself one to watch as she brings out so much in a dialogue light script. Her actions tell a wealth of story while leaving as much to self interpretation as possible. It's an exercise in expanding your mind but also in letting go and enjoying a trippy but complex love story between not only a man and a woman but a woman and a parasite.",

When \"A Topiary\" was cancelled, those watching for it on the horizon were sorely disappointed. Was it his \"Don Quixote\"? His \"Dune\"? It\u2019s kind of hard to tell from the script. What we can say about the movie we did get is that it\u2019s good, no magnum opus, no revolution, but good and really **** interesting. The main problem with Carruth runs counter to the scifi status quo. Most scifi creators share a frontal lobe brain disease that impinges their self-control around neat ideas to the extent that they cannot help but blow their creative loads on a concept by drowning it in unimportant and superficial details. Mostly people create fantasy, in space; or, in the future; or, on scorched earth. Ideas remain childish, their greater implications self-consciously mapped in awkward pseudo-science soliloquies or outright ignored because the scifi elements are just there for pageantry. Carruth, conversely, has a frustrating level of self-control. With \"Upstream Color\" he introduces like nine different amazing scifi elements, each worthy of its own film or TV show, but then completely walks away from any attempt to explain them or milk them for thrills. It\u2019s an amazing and infuriating talent. The movie itself is a meditation on ideas like cyclical and interdependent systems, individuality and memory, evolution and community, good **** It does this with careful pacing and wonderful attention to both the auditory and visual experiences of the viewer, and it leaves you stewing on all that indefinitely, because there are no definites in any part of this film.",
