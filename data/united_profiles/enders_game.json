These are pivotal to his development as a commander, however it all feels very rushed in the movie.  There is almost no back story and no character development at all.  The script leaves you with more empathy for the aliens then it does for any human character.  Frankly, some of the scenes are so random and rushed through that if i hadn't read the book, i don't think i would have understood why they were even in the movie.  Overall, one of the worst adaptations of a good book that I have seen in recent times.  It is sad to see Orson Scott Card's book turned into such a travesty.

Harrison Ford is good as Colonel Graff, but that's like saying that this chocolate tastes good, of course he's good, it's Harrison Ford. The Battle Room scenes are cool effects, which helped me out, as those scenes were difficult for me to imagine while reading.

With bad dialogue, poorly written characters as well as a lack of development from then, I didn't care for the characters at all, and sadly, even a good cast couldn't save the film; Harrison Ford giving a wooden and stiff performance, surprisingly mediocre acting from Asa Butterfield, laughable acting from Ben Kingsley and other forgettable performances  in the end, the only performance that is at least decent is Abigail Breslin, who is entirely underused in this film.

On the plus side of things, the visuals are certainly impressive and they work well with the film.

In this version, Gavin Hood (Tsotsi and X-Men Origins: Wolverine) have created his latest film about a brave young boy who enters a space military academy to defeat the alien colony in the galaxy. Ender Wiggin (Asa Butterfield) is the chosen one who uses his game techniques to defeat the aliens known as \"The Buggers\" and he was lead by Colonel Graff (Harrison Ford) who wants Ender to join the space military, so he can defeat the alien warship. In the space military, Ender is training at the huge battle room with his young crew and I would say that how spectacular where the boy was learned in space military in the 3D experience. Ender uses his skills to face those aliens in a big arena of space war and the movie takes a journey where we can see a boy can fight those aliens with his brave ability with emotions, flashbacks, and strong story. Ender's Game is a decent science fiction movie with big entertainment for young teens and children who have read by Mr. Scott Card's novel. The movie has some good acting including Butterfield and Ford, it has some spectacular effects where you can see on 3D, and clever story about a gifted boy can defeat those space invaders in outer space. It reminds me of playing a video game of Wing Commander III by 3DO in 90's.",

Honestly, this is truly one of those rare stories that both children and adults alike could really appreciate. There were some things I thought could've been improved on. There were some areas where time passed very quickly and if I hadn't read the book, I think I wouldn't been a bit confused. I think using some cinematic tricks for time lapsing quickly could've been used to create a better flow and make certain elements seem more genuine. To be honest though, as a stand alone film, that's all I really feel was flawed. Obviously it wasn't exactly like the book, nor did I expect it to be. It's just about impossible to condense an 8+ hour novel into a 2 hour movie.

A zero as in the movie has no redeeming qualities whatsoever?  I hope you don't get paid for your reviews, because reading yours was as much of a waste of time as your score was based off your own review even.  Back to the movie.  A very good adaptation of the book, got it about 90% right.  There were some major changes, there was no second invasion where Mazer is in space fighting them with a small reserve fleet--they went with him piloting a F-22 Raptor which makes no real sense, but still defeating the Formics in the same manner.  In 50 years we went from F-22's to interstellar travel?  They went way further out of the solar system than they should have (should have been on the asteroid Eros) for command school and compressed how he got the queen egg as well.  They also only had one \"little doctor\" device, but plenty of other capable firepower.  Not enough at all to say \"they ruined it\", but enough to go, why did they change it?  Technical limitations are not the answer, I mean they cranked the CGI to MAXIMUM.  It is a beautiful movie with amazing effects.  So that is an unknown, why the changes that is.  Regardless the movie still works and in some ways even better so with the emotional aspects of the story.  I felt bad for Ender, really bad, and I have read the book once as a kid and a couple times as an adult.  It plants the moral dilemma right in your lap.  How do you deal with a bully?  You beat them so bad they never even think about trying to hurt you again.  How do you deal with an alien invasion fleet that you can't reason with, just as you can't a bully?  You wipe them from existence.  But at what cost?  The complete wrecking of a child's mind?  And as a person or a child defending against a bully by beating them so bad they never fight you again, what do you cost yourself?  Is the permanent change in your personality worth it?  Just as in the book, the film answers with a  resounding yes. The enemy's gate is down, and he must be destroyed, because in the end it is your or them.  Yet you are left with sympathy and pain for having to do it.  \"\u2018In the moment when I truly understand my enemy, understand him well enough to defeat him, then in that very moment I also love him.\"  You love him yet you destroy them anyways.  Having read the book, once the credits started me and my wife got up to leave.  The crowd was not huge (3rd weekend playing, matinee, only about 25 of us) yet they seemed shell-shocked.  No one besides us was moving, at all.  Did they expect an extra scene?  Well there weren't any to see and I don't think so.  I think their brains were still trying to grasp the total destruction xenocide they witnessed and trying to process the moral dilemmas that Orson Scott Card masterfully presented in 1985.  Which is also why this movie is not a \"zero\" as that idiotic critic rated it, but a very solid 9/10.",

Obviously though there are some pretty big issues. As almost always with movies that are based off books, there are some pretty important details missing. Details that would have otherwise made it easier to get fully invested in the movie. For instance what's up with the issue of a third child in the movies universe? It's mentioned that \"a third\" could be considered an embarrassment and you need permission to have one, but we are never told why. Also the obvious complexities with Ender's relationship with his various family members are never explored, which left me feeling like I was missing something throughout the entire movie. I imagine the book touches on these things, I do not know as I have not read it, but just keep in mind not everything is as well explained as it should be.

Yes, the pacing is probably too fast, and some moments felt cheesy, but apart from that, I really couldn't find any other flaw. More time would certainly help the character development and build up our emotions for the big climax, but I think Asa Butterfield performed so well that it really didn't matter that much. He was the perfect Ender--both vulnerable and violent, sympathetic and scary. He was so good in the climax, and so were the movie makers--the climax and the twist were handled VERY, VERY WELL I couldn't stop crying at that part. But then again, maybe that's because I've read the book, so I knew exactly what Ender was feeling--I had already had the \"empathy link\" that allowed me to enjoy the movie emotionally, and I had also understood all the logic behind the story, while non-book readers might need that extra screen time and exposition to develop those. Maybe due to the break-neck pacing some non-book readers (and even some book readers) wouldn't really get the morality, the theme about empathy and humanity, and Ender's fear in all those, but really, it was all there in the movie for you to discover and digest. All in all, it was excellent movie, and more than that, it was an excellent adaptation. It was truly satisfying and definitely worth the wait. Tell everyone to watch it!",

The ending was almost abrupt, but it makes sense in the end as not even Ender knew that it was going to be the final battle. The movie also brings up the concept of morality, and how one persons victory, could be the shame of another. Now here is the spoiler: Ender is tricked into the final battle with the alien race. After the battle has been won, the higher ups praise Ender for his victory, they call him a hero. Ender on the other hand, once he has realized what has happened, thinks of himself as a killer, and that the shame of the genocide will be on him forever.

Ender's Game is one of the deepest, most thought provoking books there is, and is a must have for every bookshelf. The problem with an idolized masterpiece such as Ender's Game is that any attempts to re-create it as a motion picture will certainly be compared to the book. As most of us know by now, turning a book into a movie is no easy feat. You have to pick and choose what parts should be in the movie, who should portray the characters, and how to interpret the more abstract parts of the book. Ender's Game is about a boy who's spirit is crushed and who's childhood is extinguished for the good of mankind. The story contains numerous moral dilemmas, most of which don't have an easy answer. All in all, as a movie, Ender's Game was fine. It wasn't great, but it had it's moments and if you haven't read the book then I would advise you to go see it. However, as an avid fan of the book and all it's sequels, I feel like the movie fell victim to the inevitable outcome of not living up to the book's standards. Re-inventing the book as a movie has dented the god-like status that Ender's Game holds, and I feel like they shouldn't have tried in the first place.",

In fact I continued on with the books and they became unbearably strange. How they got almost 20 novels out of it is beyond me. While I was really excited to finally see Ender's Game on the big screen, I knew the chances of it continuing past one film would be slim at best. It all has to do with the ending, which is bizarre and really shouldn't have been continued. For those who don't know the story, in the future, Earth is at war with an alien species known as the Formics. The Humans have taken heavy losses and in desperation have started a recruitment program, that focuses on children. Knowing that kids think in a different way than adults do, they are hoping to find that one genius who has the key to defeating the Formics. That child turns out to be Ender Wiggin, a child who under Earth's new Government, shouldn't have even been born. Seeing the story I read so many years ago, come to life on the big screen, was magical for me. Finally I was able to understand the parts that were just too confusing to see in my head and get the complete picture. Ender is played by Asa Butterfield, who somewhat miraculously, at the age of 15, has had the starring role in every film he's been in. After watching Ender's game it's not hard to see why, he was to this film, what Ender was to the Human's in the story. The producers surrounded him and his young crew with a cast of Academy Award winners including Harrison Ford, Ben Kingsley, and Viola Davis, which ultimately strengthen the movie and must of really inspired this kid to give the performance he gave. While the film simply broken even at the box office, (killing any chance of a franchise developing out of it) it was very well done and closely mirrored the book. They did a near perfect job of deciding what parts should stay and what should be eliminated, giving us a film that was just as good as the book, if not better.",

On the positive side, as somebody who actually read the book, I really loved seeing all of the stuff from the book being portrayed. It all looked exactly like I imagined it and to see all of the features come to life was incredibly cool. The action sequences were also brilliantly filmed, thanks to the phenomenal special effects prevalent in everything they did. The film certainly had a really cool look and the special effects were top-notch. Above all, the film was just as exciting as the book. Sure, you could say it was just kids playing video games, but then you would miss all the moral questions about war and what they were doing with these kids. It was all more than just a game. On the negative, while I enjoyed that they tried to work in everything from the book, it all kind of felt like a tl;dr version of the book. The movie was also as if they just skimmed the book and included all the highlights, which I felt cheapened the project. I would have preferred them to either make the movie longer or cut some stuff out entirely and spend more time with other stuff, which would help slow down the pace of the film (which was a problem) and add more depth in certain areas, rather than brief snapshots of a lot of things. Finally, the acting was laughably bad at times. As a whole, it was not terrible, but as is the territory with younger actors, there were some definite stumbles at times, though none of the adults were fantastic either. As a whole, the acting was mediocre, which was unexpected.",

Like the Hunger Games movies, they dulled the story down to cash in on the teenage audience and made the constant tension that was in the book almost non-existent. None of the cast really matched their roles very well, including seasoned actors, Harrison Ford and Ben Kingsley, who, while absolutely brilliant actors, weren't really the right choices for their roles. The only right choice seemed to be Abigail Breslin for Valentine. They also missed out a HUGE chunk of the story with Peter and Valentine's characters Locke and Demosthenes.",

Well first i will say, i enjoyed it; it is one of those movies that you watch once and then you would probably re-watch it a year or two later because what happens will just shock you to the point that you don't understand what the story did. There is very little sympathy with the character, because it is hard to connect to the characters themselves. Sure enough Ender is represented as the typical high school smart kid who gets bullied because of his smarts, yet has anger issues whenever he gets picked on. Entertaining, i can say that would describe this featurette, just like any other Harrison Ford movies, entertainment, cheesy one liners, serious periods that take just a few minutes to get over, and a child to exceed his expectations (just like Shia Lebouf from the latest Indiana Jones movie).",

I especially enjoyed the ambiguity of the military here.  As a side note I somehow felt like I was watching command & conquer the movie at times :)",

      "text": "Ender's game is directed by Gavin Hood and stars Asa Butterfield, Harrison Ford, and Ben Kingsley. This movie is based on the book, Ender's Game. The plot involves a young boy named Ender Wiggin (Asa Butterfield) who is asked to participate in a Battle School to train him for the real enemies, which are called the Buggers. I personally disliked this film because of it's awful fast-pacing and it's sub-par acting, and the fact that the ending did not make any sense what-so-ever. I am the kind of person who looks deeper into the logic of movies, so if you are the kind of person who can shut their brain off and watch a movie, then you will probably enjoy Ender's Game. By itself, Enders game is an \"eh\" movie but as a movie adaptation to a book it is just horrible. 4/10",

Harrison Ford is great in his role, and the plot isn't as confusing as I thought it would be. It also keeps me interested is all of the dialogue scenes, and I didn't get bored at all watching this film. Although I can see why many don't like it. The acting could be better, and the ending feels like it is from a different movie. The beginning is also quite slow starting. In the end after thinking carefully about all the points, Enders game is quite an underrated movie, maybe I said that because I haven't read the book, but I stick by my point.",
