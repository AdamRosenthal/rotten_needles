The story can't make up its mind who the ghost is, how many ghosts there are, or whether they're ghosts or something else.  There's so much babble standing in for dialog about psychic bomb shelters and spectral beacons that confuses the story rather than clarifying it.  Greene's performance ranges from swimsuit to naughty nightie.    Nothing works in The Apparition.  The actors struggle with their roles, the parts are underwritten, the story is underpopulated, scenes go nowhere, the score is synthetic and intrusive, the editing is too busy, and The Apparition has nothing to say.  The Apparition does not deserve a theatrical release, but should haunt the $5 bins at Wal-Mart for all eternity.",

Outside of that, I'm surprised to see such low ratings here - it's really nowhere near that bad a film. Yeah, it's pretty unsurprising - but on the other hand, the characters aren't written as laughable cardboard cutouts who can't hope to pull off a believable person. The characters here are likeable and genuine, and even though the ending wasn't what I was looking for, the rest of the movie to a lesser degree was sort of what I wanted to see. It doesn't rely on cheap scares or gore to pretend to frighten us - it relies on PG-13, if not cliched, images and suspense tactics that are decent, if not \"seen before\".
