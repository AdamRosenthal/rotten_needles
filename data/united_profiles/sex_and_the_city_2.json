They shouldn't been ended since the last movie that I enjoy just a little and of course the entire series too. The characters are not laughable,there are many subplots,and why oh WHY do we have to go over with lots of problems with these ladies? Like boring stuff in issues with their relationships and there plenty of more that is far over the top. And of course they have lots of racism and too controversial when the girls are having a break at the Middle East. It's almost as bad as the Transformers 2 and I'M NOT KIDDING RIGHT THERE,they even more racism like this. WHAT WERE THEY THINKING???

You want to enjoy it, but it just blows in your face over and over and over again. It's just too much. It's over-done, over-the-top, just like the wedding at the very beginning of the movie. It's over-produced and over-thought. It lacks carelessness and ease, not to mention it crosses over to ridiculousness one too many times. It doesn't have the wit and the smarts the original series had, and you can't find anything in common with Carrie - once always broke because of her shoe addiction, now living in luxury. Before, she couldn't afford to have her apartment renovated, now she's owning two and flying out to Middle East without a blink of an eye. I'm giving it 10, because when you peel all that off - the bad script, the over-produced schemes and the horrible product-placement - you kind of get what the producers wanted to do. There's a good, honest feeling of wanting you to feel entertained there - to leave the cinema with a smile on your face.",

The film is riddled with so many over the top sexual innuendos its almost child like that they would think the audience is that stupid.  \"Lawrence my Labia\"   The middle eastern stereotypes were offensive and awkward it was almost like this once smart comedy stepped down and degraded down to a kindergarten level of writing and acting.

Yes, it has some eye rolling moments, but this movie is pure escapism similar to old movies from the 30's, 40's, and 50's.  I laughed a lot at this film, and the scene where Charlotte and Miranda talk about parenthood in the bar is one of the best dramatic and funny moments in cinema this year.  Also, I don't think these critics were true fans of the original HBO show.  That series definitely had some silly moments as well.  I don't think the movies have been that different from the TV show.  I hope they make more sequels!  There!  I said it and feel EXHILARATED!",

Now Carrie is meant to be a fashion icon and the first pair of shoes we see are garish brash sequined FAIL heels. Then she's wearing a hideous tiara with crimped hair - again someone was blind. Liza Minelli covering Beyonce Single Ladies was just absolutely woeful and sad. Sam's first sex scene lives up to the hilarity we expect and is the first good scene. The soundtrack for when they arrive in Abu Dhabi was the Stargate Movie soundtrack which was a tad wierd as I kept expecting the SG1 team any minute now. I didn't see this as insulting to Muslims as others have commented. It was four wealthy American women experiencing complete opulence in Abu Dhabi so it seemed ok to me that they didn't know much about the place, the people, the culture...  They didn't actresses justice in this movie, using camera angles, lighting and make-up that made them look old and tired. Miranda and Charlotte really took a backseat in this movie which was a shame. There were a few laughs but not as many as we've come to expect.",

As such, I recommend checking it out, but there is no truth to the portrayal of Arabs, and there is no mention of the women who find the Arab (conservative) culture to be empowering. Instead, the movie depicts the non-excessive people as submitting to the excessive rich women. That is a false and borderline deluded message. There also wasn't any focus on solving anything. The only woman who comes across as analytically smart is the red-haired one, who also uses her professional knowledge to help her friends. There are also few showings of moral integrity. The lead character shows a few heroic acts, but apart from that, it mostly follows the women as they turn off their brains and act on instincts.",
