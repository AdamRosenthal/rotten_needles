Sponegbob is Nickelodeon's king, it is the only reason Nick went out and made a movie for this. And believe me, it was satisfying. This movie looks and feels like it's for kids, but the humor is very adulty, and it seems like Nick wanted this to be like the first, older seasons of SpongeBob, quirky and fun. All the voices return from the show, but Antonio Bandreas played, really well, a pirate. This movie feels like a stoner drug trip, the effects are turned up so high, that the scenes move at a jarring pace. Sponge Out Of Water, kept me entertained and laughing during it's runtime.

I loved The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie (2004). I love the television show. I cannot believe that The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water was made by the same people! Whose idea was it to include the seagulls??? How the hell did the seagulls get approved by the writers, the director, the producers, or the studio executives??? Watching the scenes with the seagulls was akin to torture. My I.Q. dropped several points as a result of seeing this monstrosity of a movie. I tried to sleep, but the movie was so loud and obnoxious that I could not even get in a little nap! EVERYONE involved with this piece of detritus ought to be ASHAMED of themselves for cashing their paychecks. And what the HELL was Antonio Banderas doing in this movie??? This is where his career is at? Wow. And then, at the end, they throw in some half-assed rap songs with an island twist? Since when has rap EVER been associated with SpongeBob Squarepants??? JeeeeZuuuus! NOOOOOOO!!! See this movie at your own peril! Shame on you, Steven Hillenburg, Paul Tibbitt, Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger, shame on you! Give me back my 92 minutes.",

The Spongebob franchise is like Adam Sandler, its glory days were wonderful, but now I just can't stand it. So I heard this movie has the producers from the first three seasons, the only ones that ever, EVER happened, so is this movie good? Not like I wanted it to be. I saw it in 2D, but I could easilly tell when they went \"Hey! Look at our cool 3D! We're hip!\". It's not 2009 anymore, nobody gives a s*$&t;! Plus,?most of the humor was comparable to Batman & Robin. Yes, I went there. The pirate was annoying & he had seagull buddies which were like Jar Jar Binks, & It wasn't any better than the current season of spongebob. I will admit the last third act was actually better than the first two & I thought the third act was going to be the crappiest part. Other than that, a few chuckles, Tom Kenny, Rob Paulsen, Kevin Michael Richardson, & a cameo by one of my favorite YouTubers were this film's saving grace. Since my rating can't be used for the score, I'll put my rating here & my score above. I give \"Sponge Out of Water\" 1.8 out of 5 stars.",

      "text": "The Spongebob Movie: Sponge Out of Water is an entertaining watch that feels like one really, really long episode of the cartoon. Many of its jokes feel familiar, in a good way, and there's a good balance of jokes for adults and jokes for kids. Antonio Banderas was great fun to watch in particular. The gag of having them out of water and as super heroes lasted a little too long for my liking, but everything came to a satisfying cartoony conclusion.",
