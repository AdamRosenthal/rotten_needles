Yes, it was packed with laughs and it was certainly a good time, but when you look at it from a MOVIE standpoint, MacFarlane's nuts comedy turns sour. Say what you want about A Million Ways To Die In The West, but I thought that it was innovative and funny, but not a good movie. Same happens with Ted 2, the highly awaited sequel to the monstrous 2012 blockbuster comedy. Also, Seth MacFarlane's sweet tooth for misplaced musical numbers makes its way to the final finished movie. I really think that MacFarlane's team could have spent more time with Ted 2, to make it even better than its predecessor. Well, too bad. Copied spoofs for Family Guy, tiring cameos and horrible pacing are just some of the problems with this movie. Ted 2 is more of the same, which is good for some movies, but I think that we wanted something fresh and new rather than a flimsy cast with a few adjustments and a wafer thin script. But, the chemistry between Johnny and Ted is electrifying. And, Amanda Seyfried is decent too. But, Marky Mark is TOTTALY lifeless. Overall, Ted 2 is popcorn entertainment for the people who just want a good laugh, other than that it is a painfully mediocre sequel to a movie that mesmerized me.",

Ted is fighting for his own rights and wants a baby like any ordinary human being out there and although it sounds ridiculous, its very down to earth in how our society works out. Therefore there's actually a conflict needed to be solved while the first film was literally rated r comedy drama all over the place. Ted 2 in my opinion makes a good sequel and the new actress who is Ted's lawyer and Mark's new gf is a better replacement and her presence felt more needed compare to Mila Kunis from the first film. Ted 2 is a worthy sequel which beats the prequel by 1 point in general. The only thing that Ted 1 beats over Ted 2 is probably no fight scene against Ted and Mark and the jokes are abit toned down compare to the original. Regardless, this film is a 7.5/10 but i'll give it a 8/10. Most people wont agree with me but honestly this movie knows to not take itself seriously and the viewers should know this movie is about a Teddy Bear as a protagonist so shouldn't expect alot but Seth Mcfarlane jokes and stuff.",

After Seth MacFarlane's funny but weaker effort in A Million Ways to Die in the West I had my doubts about a Ted sequel being strong enough to be a success. This movie had a lot of pressure on it to perform as well as the original film which in my opinion is the funniest film of this decade. Ted 2 is not as funny as the previous film but it still is very funny and laugh out loud funny in several parts. The chemistry between Mark Wahlberg and Ted is still very much present and the pair are both really funny. Ted is truly the main character of this movie as Mark Wahlberg's character was the focal point in the first movie. Sadly in this film we lose Mila Kunis to pregnancy and she is replaced by Amanda Seyfried who I was not impressed with in A Million Ways to Die in the West but in this movie she was great and she fits in more with Wahlberg and Ted even more than Mila Kunis did. I like the idea of sending Ted to court for this film because it is entirely different than the first movie but as the movie went on I was finding more and more similarities. Ted 2 feels even more like a Family Guy episode. Giovanni Ribisi is back in this movie and I don't think he really needed to be. His character just complicated things and allowed the movie to follow almost the same path the previous movie did. I think that Ted 2 may be the funniest film we get in 2015, but it was not perfect. If MacFarlane decides to do a third Ted I think it is his best interest to take a little more time and do something really fresh with the comedy genre.",

That being said, a comedy doesn't have to sacrifice cinema in order to deliver laughs. I think the first movie was a prime example of that, as it was a genuinely good movie in addition to being hilarious. Instead, MacFarlane turns this movie into a live-action version of Family Guy. The plot is choppy and it essentially feels like a series of random skits, pieced together to form the semblance of some over-arcing plot. It was easily worth watching because it was hilarious but I expected a quality film closer to that of the first one.",

      "text": "In 2012, Family Guy creator, Seth MacFarlane, introduced the world to Ted, a talking teddy bear. People thought he was crazy, but the vulgar bear quickly gained a cult following and was a rousing success. The first film was really nothing more than an introduction to Ted, that showed just how extreme a talking teddy bear could be, but it lacked a real story line, and the jokes quickly got old. That however is not the case with the sequel. In Ted 2, the newlywed bear is not getting along with his wife. To save the marriage, they do what many couple do, and decide to have a baby. After failing to obtain \"celebrity\" sperm, Ted and Tami-Lynn decide to adopt, but the state has other ideas, as they determine, Ted can't adopted because he's not a person, he is property. From their Ted has to use every means at his disposal to prove he's a real person. This sequel has an interesting story and Seth MacFarlane finally decided to play on his strengths in regards to a film. Instead of these long drawn out jokes that seven people in the world get, he utilizes cutaways, the same way he does on Family Guy, and it really makes a difference. Half way through the first Ted, I was bored of it already, but Ted 2 is genuinely funny and can hold your interest throughout. This is the kind of film I always expected to see from Seth MacFarlane, and even people who hated the first film, will not be disappointed. Ted is certainly a unique character, but when he's portrayed in the proper setting, he becomes exactly what he was originally intended to be, hilarious!",

Of course this had some funny parts and some not so much, but I expected something better.

      "text": "Watching Ted 2 shows that it way beyond the point of no return in becoming a film that makes any sense, is that a bad thing? Absolutely not, besides that's what makes it different. But Ted 2, Directed by Seth MacFarlane, Starring Mark Wahlberg, Seth MacFarlane, Amanda Seyfried, Giovanni Ribisi, and Morgan Freeman. In my opinion, what makes this film great is the performances of the cast, the unbelievably random ass humor, and the fact that it is a worthy sequel to the first film. Now, I could not stop laughing while watching Ted 2, there would always be a joke hiding somewhere, and when you least expect it, that joke comes out and it is so random that it would trigger another joke, and then another joke, and so on and so forth. The film also had a very good running joke that I didn't even expect the first time, it was when any of the characters would use their phone or a computer to search something up it would show, \"Did you mean Black Cocks?\", and every time that happened I burst into laughter. The performances of the cast was great, even the cameos were random, I mean we got Liam Neeson buying a box of Trix and asking Ted if it was weird that he was buying cereal meant for kids, David Hasselhoff crying on stage while talking about Knight Rider, Tom Brady freaking out after Johnny and Ted were in his house to jack him off for is sperm, Jay Leno being a gay guy who has sex in a bathroom in bar when everyone finds out that he had been doing just that, and so many others. The structure of the film was no different to the first film but it did improve. I am definitely looking forward to what Seth Macfarlane has in store for television, and movie goers next, cause Ted 2 will be pretty hard to beat because it is one of the best comedy films in 2015.",

The only two black characters in the film have the personality of 'stupid' or 'sassy', whilst homosexuals are also ridiculed in a court sequence. Another scene involves jokes about 9/11 and the Charlie Hebdo shootings. During these moments, I honestly felt ashamed to be in the cinema.",
