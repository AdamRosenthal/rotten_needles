We don't need a complicated trisecting storyline with braindead characters to complement random limbs getting hacked apart (and believe me, there are plenty of limbs flying around this movie). The second main flaw, to me at least, is the movie's idea of a ninja. To me, ninjas are meant to be unassuming, enigmatic, killers who work alone for some self-defined benefit. Not in this movie. Here, ninjas are essentially as refined as an LA street-gang who run aimlessly around and throw ungodly amounts of ninja stars, which coincidentally sound like loud bullets, which ruins the point of a using a ninja star over a gun. Most of the ninjas in the movie are there to simply get shot down by the SWAT team (the movie wastes no time for epic, romantic battle scenes, save for the few with the Asian superstar Rain).

The movie directed by James Mc Teigue, and supported by Wachowski Brothers (THE MATRIX, 1999). Mc Teigue, we remembered him on his last film, V FOR VENDETTA (2005). In this newest feature, Mc Teigue improved with more actions and straight-to-the-point plots. The Actions however had a few weaknesses. The fight-scene is too fast and not focus, despite the special effect already in right measurement. The only thing that I like on thiz movie, is for the first time Ninja aura was revealed better on Hollywood movie. Rain performance was not stable. In one scene he could be an unmerciful Ninja, but on the other scene he shows softer character. I remembered in one scene, when Raizo (Rain character), was being watched on interrogation room. One police said, He is not seems like a Ninja to me,..It is more like a boy-band member. Do not blame him, he is: a boy-band.  Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",

Most of the action in the film is extremely well handled (other than a frankly quite laughable chase on foot through speeding traffic) and for the most part the fight scenes are creative, stylised and brutal, with copious assistance from CGI. The film is very obviously a McTeigue/Wachowski collaboration, with similar aesthetics and an identical central theme of revenge as their previous joint effort, V for Vendetta, though it lacks that film's darkness and political subtext. Lead actor Rain, with his dance background, can handle the stunts without difficulty, but he isn't a particularly good actor and his vengeful ninja outcast Raizo doesn't make for a very compelling protagonist. The rest of the cast, particularly Naomie Harris are a little bland and their performances underwhelming. Sho Kosugi, however, makes for a decent, extremely menacing antagonist, the diabolical ninja Lord Ozunu, though Kosugi is simply once again playing the kind of character that made his name. The film's script leaves a lot to be desired, and the story is conventional, occasionally verging on dull. In addition, the finale, though technically accomplished, makes it crystal clear that all you need to defeat an army of highly trained killing machines armed with swords is to carry a lot of guns. Ninja Assassin may be action-packed and gloriously ultraviolent, providing sporadic perverse pleasure, but it's also as dumb as a bag of rocks.",

      "text": "Without a doubt, ninja are the most mysterious martial artists or killers imaginable. Sho Kosugi for decades has somewhat amazed us with his talent for bringing the ninja reputation to the captive eye, but beneath all of the luster there lies a fragment of boringness, false perception, and over glamorous situations where you begin to wonder why the story panned out the way that it did. You never expect a gory killer to associate himself with a hot chick and have to rely on her. I mean, lets face it- that kind of a man would have disposed of her to keep himself hidden. Instead, they go off on their crazy Hollywood adventure. I gave this a six only because of its action packed flesh-ripping sequences, but its not something that could entice me twice.",

      "text": "As I looked in the Bluray cover my friend borrowed me, I already knew what I was going for in this film: A brutally violent, yet overly serious and too choppy motion picture to be entertaining. That is the case with this movie, but what's worst is the addition of paper-thin characters, half-baked plotting, and poorly directed, edited gory scenes, with zero knowledge of what is going on in the particular scenes. There was no sense of fun in those sequences. Sure, there were ninjas with knives, swords, bladed chains, but does that really equal to good action? Absolutely no. The way director James McTeigue structured the action beats was beyond rushed and horrendous, with quick cuts, unnecessary close-ups and unrealistic jumps, along with awful editing, which is in display just by looking at the obviously shoddy CGI blood effect. Of course this guy learned nothing about \"Matrix\".",
