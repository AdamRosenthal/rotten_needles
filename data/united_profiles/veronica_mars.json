For devotees of the much loved series, this long-awaited Veronica Mars feature film is a five-star proposition. For everyone else, Veronica Mars is a pleasant diversion. (And you need know nothing about the young sleuth or her past exploits on TV to like it.) The film is a charming exercise in contemporary girl power, with mystery and romance thrown in for good measure. Kristen Bell puts her approachable persona to good use in the role of Veronica, a semi-outcast from Neptune, Calif., who never ran with the cool kids in high school. Still, it was made clear she'd outstrip them all eventually. And she has. The movie opens with Veronica being interviewed for a top job with a New York law firm. A brief voiceover from the title character fills in most of the past, explaining her need to get out of corrupt little Neptune and make a life for herself. Veronica has walked away from Neptune, sleuthing, and her rocky relationship with Logan Echolls (Jason Dohring), building a new life as a fledgling lawyer on the opposite coast and dating her college boyfriend (Chris Lowell). Brisk and clever (and often very funny), Veronica Mars has a terrific ensemble cast that includes a couple of stand-outs: Krysten Ritter, back as Gia Goodman, for example, and Gaby Hoffman, who turns up as a character named Ruby Jetson. The story also has a handful of cameos and inside jokes, including a bit with James Franco; there's a general irreverence to the writing that's one of the movie's best features. The uninitiated can be assured that Veronica Mars is entertaining from start to finish.",

The Veronica Mars movie, coming back to the town of Neptune to help her old friend friend, 'Lachlan' because he is framed for murder. Or course he is! Watching this made me think about the series again, you get to see older characters, what has become of their lives, and what has changed since Veronica's departure to the 'Big Apple' to become a big time lawyer. But the voices of Neptune call her back for one last stand. For a Kickstarter of 5.9 million, i have to say that this is amazing, the script has been in the making for a few years now, and you can tell that it was well thought out. The voice over narration of Veronica brought back memories from the TV Show and was urging me to watch it again. Surely there are things that would be plainly obvious to happen (just like every part of the TV Show) but that is what i think makes VM so attractable, we know what is going to happen, we just don't know how she is going to get out of it. If you are a fan, watch it, if you are not a fan, watch it. It is good fun to watch, but still at the same time there will be reunions so you might want to read up on those relationships which is shown to be the downfall to TV series to sequel movies.",

It gives the die-hard fans what they want, but as a stand alone film Veronica Mars falls a bit short. Essentially an entire 22 episode season's worth of sleuthing, thinking and problem solving were crammed into a little more than an hour and a half movie. However, it retains enough charisma and Veronica Mars charm to keep fans of the series entertained the whole time.",

      "text": "Overall, a very dull and poorly written film with an overly confusing plot. I guess for followers of the original TV series there is some appeal here - I remember several scenes which didn't further the story, but instead seemed to revel in providing forced-feeling fan service. Although, to be honest, I found most of the characters Veronica was reunited with more irritating than entertaining. A fan of the show recommended the film to me, and I've certainly seen a lot worse, but for those unfamiliar with Veronica's TV escapades I would recommend avoiding this movie adaptation.",
