Although lighthearted, the paper thin plot that does not allow much of characters development and utilise the ideas from other animations by changing a small part here and there are unable to make the adorable yet naughty penguins to match the quality of the old times of studio's production, even any recent Disney's production, or to match Puss in Boots (spin-off of Shrek series).

Unfortunately, they are joined by a crew of not that interesting characters who weigh down the film following its first ten minutes.

A silly villain with an even sillier plan to take over the world. It's entertaining as ever, however it's seems that they've forced it with a morale that's never been present until the end of the film. In terms of jokes, you just can't help but laugh. It's definetly a movie for your whole family.",
