I guess for most people they can't stand this message but it isn't surprising considering how racist our country is.  I'm not religious but the films portrayal of both faith and secular views are very respectful which is rare in film today. My family and I loved this film and it brought us all to tears.

But, anyone with the slightest heart and humanity in them, will be moved to tears by its message of faith, hope, and love.  The entire theater--both young and old-- were sobbing by the end of the movie.  It left us speechless by its touching story and is personally one of the best movies I've seen.  Don't be fooled by the spiteful, dubious reviews.",

      "text": "We all like stories and this story of a little boy who wants to see his dad come home from war will pull at your heart as you watch him try to \"will\" his dad home. Jakub Salvati is \"Little Boy\"  and brings a freshness to the screen that has not been seen in years. The rest of the cast do their jobs admirably, though there is something very special in the interaction between Little Boy and Hashimoto, the Japanese stranger who moves into town.  Critics do not like the film because it has a strong \"Norman Rockwell\" \"Frank Capra\" air about it.   The priests are decent people. The mother of little boy is strong and holds the family together. The film does not shy away from the hatred and bigotry many held toward Japanese Americans during the war but confronts it with some real lessons for our times.  There is no glorification of war and the pain felt on the home front is very visible in the character development. Are some scenes predictable? Perhaps. Does the director telegraph some of his moves? Yes. But none of this affects the overall feel and charm of the film. David Henrie does a super job of having the older son bottling up and exploding until a critical moment. so I recommend the film strongly and urge viewers to judge for themselves who is right  - the critic or the ordinary guy.",

An auto mechanic is sent James Busbee (Michael Rapaport) is sent to Japan to fight the Japanese during World War II, leaving his wife (Emily Watson) two sons London (David Henrie) Pepper (Jakob Salvati). Pepper feels upset without his father by his side, so he can't wait for him to return. His favorite magician Ben Eagle (Ben Chaplin) and priest (Tom Wilkinson) convince him to bring his dad home. The filmmakers want to make a story but they failed to make the story good overall they just made a silly mess. Grade B-",
