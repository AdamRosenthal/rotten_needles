For most of the movie, there isn't that much happening really. It's quite boring. Just an ordinary young girl and her family going through their regular everyday routine. Nothing out of the ordinary happening. Yeah, the father gets laid off and it sparks drama in the family. But in this day and age and in recession, it happens to most people. Still nothing out of the ordinary really. In other words, the story is not very interesting at all. The daydreaming parts is actually the best part of the movie because it offers an accurate depiction of a child's imagination. Furthermore the daydreaming parts are the only part of movie where the story goes a little deeper. The rest of the story is very slow moving and isn't very deep at all. There are many EXCELLENT movies which consists of slow moving stories (like The Curious Case of Benjamin Button for example). But the difference is the story is very deep and original and keeps the audience interested. That's absolutely not the case with this movie.",
