But this screenplay is so corny and full of insipid plot holes and logical leaps that is strains credulity.  The director is very adept in filming the action scenes and makes good use of the various locations.  But you can't get past the stupid script, unless you just don't care how stupid it is.  While one must be able to suspend disbelief to go with a number of movies, some movies just push that envelope so badly that it does not work.  Luc Besson's heavy handed mitts are clumsily all over this formulaic, corny and predictable story with cliche-ridden villains, which is a shame.  Zoe Saldana is almost worth the price of admission, but this would have been better if it were a female \"Bourne\" or her being the next Lara Croft.

      "text": "Restraint isn't a word that you'd normally associate with filmmaker Quentin Tarantino, especially in \"Kill Bill: Vol. 1\", the Grand Guignol revenge spectacle, starring Uma Thurman as The Bride, the be-all and end-all of female vigilantes, who keeps killing until there's nobody left to kill. Despite the high body count, the film does have a moral center as it pertains to children, unlike cross-generational films such as John Carpenter's \"Assault on Precinct 13\"(where during the infamous ice cream truck sequence, a little girl is graphically shot in the chest), and the recent \"Kick-Ass\", featuring Chloe Moretz, who as Hit Girl, similar to young Cataleya in \"Colombiana\", seems way too wise beyond her years, in regard to violence. In retrospect, Tarantino has his limits. Vernita, a.k.a. \"Copperhead\", allows her daughter Nikki to have a childhood(in \"Kill Bill: Vol. 2\", Bill turns out to be a surprisingly good parent, too), and in return, The Bride allows the girl to live, even though a double homicide would have been cleaner. Nikki acts like how a little girl should, when confronted with the sight of some strange woman removing a knife from her mother's chest. She does nothing. A recent slate of films(in addition to \"Kick-Ass\", there is also Joe Wright's \"Hanna\" and Jaume Collet-Serra's \"Orphan) makes it seem completely natural that a child should stab or shoot like a pro. Tarantino understands that Nikki is too young for murder; too unformed for vengeance, so she just stands there, shellshocked, as The Bride wipes the blood off from her blade. In \"Colombiana\", however, taking its cues from those aforementioned movies, in which kids commit violent acts with a disproportionate amount of competence, and more disturbingly, with steely resolve, Cataleya pins the hand of a drug lord's henchman to the table, and declares her intention \"to kill Don Luis,\" only moments after a hit squad orphans the girl, as if maiming a grown man, then escaping through an open window, and scaling down a building, followed by her outrunning a pack of angry Colombians through a shanty town, is par for the course, despite being nine. To put her exploits in perspective, Paul Kersey(Charles Bronson), perhaps, the most famous vigilante of them all, whose actions in the \"Death Wish\" movies inspired real-life copycats, is downright tentative in responding to the home invaders that destroys his family. The ease in which Cataleya handles a knife becomes a contextual indicator of violence in regard to its cultural evolution from being a man's business to mere kid's play, since Bronson's first weapon isn't a gun, but a sock filled with quarters, twenty dollars worth, which he acquires from the bank, in lieu of procuring a real weapon from an arms dealer. Ironically, it's the architect who possesses a childish armament, whereas Cataleya, upon arriving in the states, announces to her older brother that she wants to be a killer. The girl turns Bronson into Macaulay Culkin; when Paul is home alone, he swings the sock over his head. Emilio tries to deter Cataleya from her plan by shooting over a crowd to no avail. \"Colombiana\" avoids controversy by cutting to Cataleya all grown up, thereby averting the unsettling sight of a homicidal minor. As an adult, Cataleya is played by Zoe Saldana, and because of her skin color, the kneejerk response is to link her to blaxploitation stars such as Pam Grier and Tamara Dobson, since the film itself is being marketed as a sort of black \"Le Femme Nikita\". But where's the camp value? To put it in politically incorrect terms, Cataleya kills like a white woman, a female vigilante more akin to Camille Keaton in \"Day of the Women\", and especially, Christina Lindberg in \"Thriller: A Cruel Picture\"; women with sadism on their minds. For a heroin, the 1973 Bo Arne Vibenius cult classic had a heroin-addled farm girl(made mute by rape), who goes on a killing spree after escaping from a life of sex slavery. Although Madeline's vengeance is justified(she shoots her johns, both male and female), there's no condoning her deviation from the hit list when the one-eyed girl kills two cops, and the innocent motorists she runs off the highway. By the time Madeline gets to Tony, the purity of the girl's mission is all but compromised, due to the pleasure she derives from her use of torture on the pimp. It's the ruination of all vigilantes, the humanity that becomes mislaid as they hazard through their righteous quest, in which the wronged person becomes the very thing he/she hates, a cold-blooded killer. Instead of a horse, Cataleya uses sharks and dogs to do her pernicious bidding. This tag killer(an orchid) is not the little girl who watched her parents get murdered. She becomes an evil that both Emilio and the film itself doesn't seem to grasp. \"Colombiana\" is as desensitized to violence as Cataleya seems to be. It's left to the moviegoer to judge this serial murderer.",

      "text": "Seriously. Kicks. A$$. Really. I don't understand what all the fuss is about - I walked into the theater expecting to see a poorly made, crappy movie where all the actors are uttering cheesy one-liners and doing unbelievably stupid stunts that did not add to the plot of the movie - this is what I was led to believe by all of the negative reviews. In fact, I almost did NOT see this movie in the theater at all. Boy, are all of the critics who posted horrible reviews of this movie WRONG, WRONG, WRONG. Columbiana, starring Zoe Saldana as the titular character, is a hotbed of action which steam-rolls through from beginning to end. Incredibly, the killing and other violent activities which form the basis of the movie do not bump the flick up from a PG-13 rating - how they did this, I will never know, because the movie is very, very violent. People talk about the lack of character development in this movie - that is just a big, steaming pile of horse manure. Here's why: As most of you must know by now, the main character and protagonist, Cataleya Restrepo (Amandla Stenberg & Zoe Saldana), is the daughter of a kingpin in the drug trade. When Fabio (Jesse Borrego), Cataleya's father, decides to leave the particular drug cartel he is associated with, the cartel's Don or father, named Don Luis (Beto Benites) orders Fabio and his entire family killed. Fabio discovers the kill-order, and attempts to flee with his wife Alicia (Cynthia Addai-Robinson) and daughter, 10 year old Cataleya - but they are too late. Unfortunately, the parents are killed in an off-screen standoff-cum gun-battle inside their home while Cataleya sits terrified at the kitchen table. She does not see her parents killed, but she knows what has happened. THIS IS ALL THE CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT THIS TYPE OF MOVIE NEEDS. The violent murders of Cataleya's parents creates a thirst for vengeance which will not be sated until all parties involved suffer a similar fate. This is the movie's moment of truth: It defines the way the story is treated from that moment forward. Critics have complained that the audience was not shown HOW Cataleya developed her childhood \"parkour\" or speedy obstacle navigation escape skills. That's just silly - first, the child of a drug kingpin in Bogota, Columbia would most likely be taught by her gun-wielding parents SOME type of self defense - which NEED NOT be part of the film's scope - second, any child who plays with other children knows how to run, jump and hide - and third, a terrified child is usually uniquely capable of eluding pursuers for a short period of time if given enough of a head-start. I have also read complaints regarding Cataleya's lack of a personality - that's ridiculous. She is simply a vengeful **** who does not lose focus - ever since escaping, her ultimate goal has been killing those responsible for murdering her family. We even get to see her interact lovingly with her uncle, Emilio Restrepo (Cliff Curtis), her grandmother, Mama (Ofelia Medina), her boyfriend, Danny Delanay (Michael Vartan), her adopted family, and her dogs. The movie is careful to show that while these parts of her personality are important to her, Cataleya cannot truly move forward with her emotional development until she has exacted her revenge. Critics of the movie have complained about silly little cosmetic touches like Zoe wearing a black leotard, Zoe dancing in front of the camera, and Zoe sucking a lollipop. REALLY? Are these the things that make a movie BAD? Get real. The most important aspect of the movie for me is that Cataleya is forced to see that her single-minded focus on vengeance directly causes the remaining members of her family to be murdered. She is also forced to see what she has become when she faces FBI agent Ross (Lennie James) and threatens the lives of his family in order to assure his cooperation. Once this happens, and once Cataleya finally kills the man who ordered her family murdered, she is able to move forward with her development - and her life. The story has a neat, tidy ending, perhaps leaving the audience with a feeling as anticlimactic as Columbiana herself must have felt. Do yourself a favor - do not listen to the critics - see this movie and judge for yourself. Columbiana is a legendary piece of action filmmaking.",

They want a strong, capable female action hero, but they also want her to be vulnerable, moral and relatable; they want a thrilling action blockbuster, but they also want it to have emotional depth; they want silly over-the-top fight sequences, but they also want a believable story. It's this kind of indecision that eventually makes the movie just end up being weak as its ideas are spread too thin.

It's been done before of course, but i was surprised at how darkly amoral everyone seems to be in this movie. Basically zoe saldana's drug dealing parents were killed by their drug dealing boss, so as a young girl she vows to kill him right back. But she doesn't do it right away, being only eight or nine years old. She escapes from her homeland and travels to america where she learns from her killer of a brother how to become an assasin, and spends the rest of her life killing bad guys for money in the hopes of drawing out her real target so she can kill him. Obviously we're supposed to side with Cataleya on her riteous quest for payback, but she's just not that likeable. Her revenge motivation seems like not much more than an excuse to waste people in interesting ways, or her double standard when it comes to morality. In one scene she weeps miserably over her lost parents, then in the next sentence, she threatens to kill the family of an FBI man one by one if he doesn't help her. Her brother and mentor isn't much better. In another scene, he preaches to a young Cataleya the importance of education after randomly murdering some passerby in front of her school.  Attempts are made to humanize Cataleya by showing she's in a relationship with Michael Vartan, a bland acessory who mostly communicates in mumbles of affection. He seems pathetically subservient, as if he's just happy to be hittin that. Later in the movie, when he finds out the love of his life has murdered dozens of people, he sheepishly asks when he can see her again. With a story and characters this weak its hard to enjoy the action when that starts heating up. You can point out the plot early on, and find no surprises. There's the loved ones that are going to be killed off at the end of the second act..there's the dedicated cop who will chase his prey through the whole movie but never quite make it..there's the smug kingpin who will get the most creative death..yeah, we've seen it all before.",

Just some movies I can name are  obvious ones like The Lord of the Rings or  Saving Private Ryan. There are less obvious ones like The Third man or the Edge of Tomorrow.  And there are even reversed ones like were the main characters are in one place in the way of others travelling.",

Overall, the movie was not bad at all, but definitely not my taste: Unnecessary killing of a tag-killer/assassin with moments of sensitivity and moments of just pure heartlessness isn't very deep at all, in fact, it's on the shallow side of a semi-mainstream action movie.",
