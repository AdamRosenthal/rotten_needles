So not much story there, it is 'explained' very shortly why the aliens are there but it's one of the classic reasons so not much creativity in the plot. The 'novelty' here is that the aliens are invisible (a bit like those in Final Fantasy - Spirits Within) but power up electric stuff as they pass it (lamps, cars, cellphones,...) so our heros have to move by night instead of day (inverse of zombie flicks). If the aliens kill someone they evaporate to dust (like in War of the Worlds) and the night look of the film reminds me somewhat of Cloverfield. So they stole from a lot of other good movies but it's not nearly as good as any of them. Some of the heros die, but you won't care much coz the acting isn't great. The VFX are okay for it's budget but we've all seen better. With all that said, it's not as bad a movie as you would think.

But what I must point out is the length of film is always important to note - I felt it was too short to hold my attention. I wanted to know more. As it was quite short, it is also useful to illustrate the pacing, as it realised it had to skip certain areas, rushing in order to make the 85-90 minute time limit. The beginning normally needs to either fill us in properly on background detail or give us time to develop it during the disaster. Although this did happen throughout the film, we did get a little background detail of some of the main characters. What made this film not sink into bad territory was the continued update of the journey to escape from the electric creatures, which I thought were awesome. It was quite courageous to use them as the mainspring in this film, as it was obvious in this situation that it was a devastating attack. It was amazing to see the characters start to rely on each other in such dire need and that rescue came when it was most needed.",

I hope she gets more and more chances to shine because she could be the next Cameron Diaz. She was great in the short-lived remake of Charlie's Angels and I see she's going to have a new show on TV this fall. As for the actual aliens, I actually really liked the concept used in this film. It wasn't the same old regurgitated idea from every other alien-invasion film before it. It uses a refreshing idea that creates an enemy that rivals any in terms of hopelessness. There were some plot holes and some aspects that were because of low-budget issues but overall, this film was very good and doesn't deserve the shortsighted criticisms many people have given it.",
