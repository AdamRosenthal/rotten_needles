      "text": "After a slightly disappointing run for Pixar in the last few years with movies like Monsters University and Cars 2, the power house of animation gives us their most thematically complex film since Wall-E. In Inside Out , the life of an eleven-year old girl named Riley is shown to be controlled by five voices inside her head: Joy, Sadness, Disgust, Fear, and Anger. They control her emotions and affect her memories, but Riley's life is thrown out of control when she moves to San Francisco. Her core memories, the most important ones, are thrown out of the control center as well as Joy and Sadness, so they have to journey back to put Riley's life back on track. The plot itself doesn't contain any big twists or even a villain. It's a seemingly simple tale with huge ambition. Showing what's going on in someone's head is a difficult feat, but Pixar achieves this in such a creative and original way. The ideas presented in Inside Out might fly over younger kids' heads, as there are some rather complex themes here: you can't be happy without experiencing sadness or anger or disgust or fear. They are natural parts of life. The film even deals with depression, identity, and self-worth. Inside Out is undeniably the most enjoyable, hilarious, and entertaining film that incorporates such heavy themes. It's certainly not a movie you will ever forget.",

This movie takes emotions head-on, and the utility of providing kids some kind of a mental map of how their emotions work is empowering and potentially life-changing. The movie is not perfect: emotions might play a huge role in our lives (especially kids), but they are not the only things that control us (though to be fair, the movie does not make the characters simply robots controlled by their emotions), and there are are a few minor stereotypes. However, the merits of Inside Out far-and-away outshine these foibles. Plenty of meaty issues to talk about, and even hints at more to come in kids lives. Shows emotions co-operating (and sometimes competing) to try for the well-being of their characters, and shows that everyone has emotions and that emotions can be complicated and nuanced. I can imagine that teens will pretend that they are not interested, so target audience would be 5 or 6 up to about 12. But if you can get your teenager to go, they will probably (internally) resonate with many of the issues and the way they are handled. My kids loved it.",

With the exception of Cars (which got Mildly positive reviews) all Pixar movies gained critical acclaim, with two films even getting nominated for best picture (UP and Toy Story 3) But after Toy Story 3, there was Cars 2. The movie that broke the chain of good movies. After that there was Brave, a dissapointment, and Monsters University another pretty bad movie. Pixar seemed to have lost its charm. Until this movie. Inside Out has all the amazing things of a Pixar movie plus more. All Pixar movies are visually stunning (even Cars 2), but this movie takes it up a notch. Never have I seen a movie create a completely new world so perfectly. Not only were the enviroments amazing, but the characters were great. The last time I felt this way about characters I had just met was Up. Of course in UP I cried in the first 8 minutes (which I usually dont do in movies so thats saying something) and in this movie I cried towards the end. If this doest get nominated for best picture there will be issues. My rating would be a 98/100 (9.8/10), but Im going to round it up to a 10. Pixar, youve done it again",

The film takes us inside the head of a young pre- pubescent girl and, more specifically, her emotions; joy, fear, sadness, disgust and anger. In so doing it unlocks a world that one would have been hard pressed to imagine. Although possibly too complex for very young children they will never the less engage with the colourful and likeable characters. Adults, however, will love it and gaze in awe and wonder as a story and screenplay unfolds that exudes intelligence and imagination. Even pathos gets a genuine look in here which is not often the case in animated films where emotions are often overly manipulated and almost forced out of you. The whole thing is just jaw droppingly hypnotic and provides a definite upward swing in animations fortunes where the offerings of the last couple of years have, generally, been pretty dismal.",

This film pushed so many of my buttons on a personal level that it's belittling to rank it with the common-tongue descriptor of 'masterpiece'. Inside Out . . . moved me deeply . . . beyond examination. I . . . didn't merely cry during this film, though you could say that the three or four times when I sniffled and my eyes welled up with **** that I was crying then. That was when I was crying. However, I also wept, no, I SOBBED. I profusely balled by eyes out like a big weenie. And it was one of the most cathartic experiences of my life. Never before has a work of cinema emitted such wracking waves of pure, touching storytelling that conveys so much universal, human understanding. Just because I cried (ON NUMEROUS OCCASIONS), I wouldn't label this a melancholic, downer of a movie. It finds the perfect balance of euphoric, jubilant happiness to offset the brewing, incessant sadness that comes with every moment of joy. It is the sad realization that the feeling of elation is fleet. It won't last. As much as we want to reminisce and relive our memories from early youth, the purest concentration of feeling we have, we grow older and are taken out of the comfort of the world we've become used to. Moving, losing friends, growing out of childish things like imaginary friends (Oh, Bing Bong, WHHYYYYY??!!), becoming distanced from your family and becoming more independent, all these things are essential to the unending departing nature of life. I think goodbyes are truly the most traumatic loss we can experience. Inside Out illustrates that visually in a way that is unprecedentedly effective and hard-hitting. It is also brilliantly scripted, hilarious, GORGEOUSLY ANIMATED, ingeniously concepted and executed with unwavering skill and focus.",

At least warn the public that your kids are going to get a full dose of the reality blues if they go to see this film. On numerous occasions my 6 year old daughter asked me why all the characters are crying. Then it gets really awesome when the little emotion of \"joy\" character is down in the dark waste bin of memories with the main character's imaginary friend. She clutches the smoldering and dying memories of past happiness and sobs uncontrollably. But she does eventually make it out of this purgatory because imaginary friend sacrifices his life and slowly fades away dissolving before our eyes. But the kicker was when my kid looks at me and asks with troubled eyes what will happen when the last solid island of this girls thoughts (truth island has already died as she steals from her mother to run away from home, etc) \"family island\" will crumble and disappear.

Its joyful to see the film explain how the various features of the human mind work leading to tons of laughs and smiles. At the same time though it feels like too much of the film is that. Inside Out often gets so caught up in the gimmick that it forgets to tell a story. There are really powerful themes not only about the necessity of sadness; but about how each emotion has its place and you shouldn\u2019t let one emotion rule your entire life. Whenever the film explores that it becomes something special. Had each element of Riley\u2019s mind tied back to the film\u2019s theme and helped the characters explore themselves like in Finding Nemo or Up this film could\u2019ve become something special. Its still charming as it is having the fun of the mind and again there is some substance but again the gimmick holds it back. Even with all that said though I still really enjoy the film its more an explanation for why it doesn\u2019t hit me as hard as Pixar\u2019s other films. Whether it be for its charming gimmick or its thought provoking message Inside Out is the first time in a while I can say Pixar made a film that was really good.

It mostly deals with a little girl's depression about moving to a new city with her family.  In fact, I only remember one laugh out loud part, where we get a glimpse into a boy teenager's mind when he tries to talk to a girl.

The emotional impact of the first 10 minutes of Up is brought to an entire movie here. I may have laughed a lot, and came away smiling; but, in the middle, I cried, I weeped and openly bawled. The secret of Pixar has always been the ability to make a story that kids could follow with elements that only the adults watching would understand, and then to make those elements almost a whole other movie. Think of Finding Nemo, which had two actual separate story lines, Nemo's and his Dad's, yet the storytelling was so complex that both stories had this magic dust applied to them and a classic was born. Here, the moments so vivid and painful for adults will just slip right past kids\u2014Bambi's mother dying this isn't. And, judging from the kids in my audience they loved it too. But the adults, were floored by the beautiful depiction of the necessity of sadness in our lives, and the sacrifice of youthful innocence that happens to all of us as adulthood creeps in. The emotional impact was among the strongest I have ever had in a theatre, and it was also one of the purest. Pete Doctor and Pixar didn't just pull my heartstrings and manipulate my emotions, they  created that emotion by brilliant storytelling and trusting their audience to make the connections.

From the excellent voice acting to the helpful way it can actually teach kids how to manage emotions, to the accurate portrayal of neurological changes during child development, it was such a fantastic movie!",

At points it reminded me of a children's version of inception or interstellar, delving into heady ideas such as memories, their impact on our lives, and the way we perceive them. I was annoyed at points however when it became clear that certain elements were added to pander to kids, such as the imaginary elephant friend Bing Bong, even though I guess you could argue that it was a kids' movie and that character paid off in the end anyways. It all adds up to a moving and thought provoking finale though that nearly erases any previous missteps.

Wreck-it-Ralph, although great, was only made by Disney. (Pixar was not involved with it.) Inside Out, Disney and Pixar's new animated film is not only a return to high quality for Pixar, it's also an amazing movie, close to being my favourite film of all time. The story is about emotions inside your head who decide how you act and what you say. We take a look at Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear and Disgust - the five emotions of 11-year-old Riley, who has just moved from Minnesota to San Francisco and is having a tough time living in her new home. In Riley's head, all of her memories are stored, including five 'core memories' that power a different part of her personality in the form of islands. When Joy and Sadness try to keep the core memories positive, they get sucked out of headquarters and fall into Long Term Memory. With Anger, Fear and Disgust controlling Riley, she has no happiness or sadness, so Joy and Sadness must get back to headquarters before Riley loses all of her personality. Amy Poehler voices Joy (you may remember her from that squeaky role as Elanor in Alvin and the Chipmunks 2: The Squeakquel and its sequel, Chipwrecked), Phyllis Smith voices Sadness (you might remember her from her role of Phyllis Lapin-Vance in The Office), Lewis Black voices Anger (he is the funniest emotion in the whole film), Bill Hader voices Fear (he also voiced Flint Lockwood in Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs and its sequel) and Mindy Kaling voices Disgust (who you might remember from voicing Taffyta Muttonfudge in Wreck-it-Ralph). Everyone does a great job at acting, but Amy Poehler, Phyllis Smith and Lewis Black stand out in particular. It's great how on their way back to headquarters, Joy and Sadness go through the process of a number of different things that happen to us, such as how dreams are made and where all our imagination lives (in Imagination Land, which was also a 3-part South Park episode). Inside Out is one of Disney and Pixar's best films to date. I might even go as far as to say it's the best film they've made. Oh, and why is this review late? America got Inside Out first on June 19th. Over here in the UK however, I had to wait until July 24th to see this. Was it worth the wait? Definitely.",

      "text": "As for movies, Pixar has been most of the time a mixed bag -- sometimes producing excellent animation movies like Up and Toy Story, others like Cars 2 (a not so good movie) and just solid movies (Brave). Though you have to give it credit for creating films like Wall-E, Ratatouille, The Incredibles, Finding Nemo, all of which were successful, some more than others. Now, about this genre animation thing, I've been pretty bored. Yeah, I have grown up since I watched animated movies, but that doesn't mean these pictures can become stale, boring and flat-out unoriginal. \"Up\" is pretty stupid if you look at it, however it's one of my favorite Pixar's output to this date, and I can't fathom how anyone could dislike it. I knew someone on the Internet who deeply despised it, and called the film \"sentimental, manipulative and nonsensical\". Jesus Christ, it's just a kid's movie, of course it's going to be silly and stuff, because it's for family entertainment. No one needs to be this harsh on a movie made only to appease children. But getting back to the original debate, I thought Pixar's old formula was getting too humdrum for my taste. Yesterday \"Inside Out\" proved to be a delightful trip for start to finish, and that is all thanks to its creativity. Corny little creatures inside of one's mind, with lots of scenarios like subconscious, islands of memories, dream production, among others is something that no one has ever seen. Along with some genuinely hilarious lines, the premise proved itself worthy, and the distinction the writers made with the characters was spot-on: Joy, Sadness, Anger, Disgust and Fear. It has got all the emotional mechanisms to drive Riley's growing personality forward. In this movie, everything is messed up. Riley goes to another city and is forced to say goodbye to her friends and home, which she loved. With her first day in school, Riley is put in the edge of breaking, and meanwhile Joy and Sadness get stuck in her long-term memory section. It's up to Joy to get back to headquarters and help Riley be happy again.",

Each is represented by a different character and each have voice actors who fit perfectly. It's extremely interesting to see how each emotion reacts to every situation and how you may relate to some or predict others before they happen. The humor is quite good as well, It's not like the movie was trying to make you laugh but you can find humor in lots of situations. Inside Out at times feels like a movie that adults may enjoy more then kids but that's mostly to the deeper meanings behind most jokes in the movie. Inside Out is a movie more enjoyable to watch the less you know about it so try and keep what you know about the movie to a minimum. Anyone who loves Pixar/Dreamsworks etc will enjoy Inside Out regardless and is also a movie I can see people coming back to in the future.",

The plot is familiar but the creativity and conceptualisation of Pixar to tell the story from inside the mind of a girl using five different emotions - joy, sadness, anger, disgust and fear have brought their latest picture to secure the Oscars. Not only focusing on the emotions, the story further expands into memories (short/ long-term and core memories), imagination, dreams and forgetfulness in a fantastic landscape to construct the feeling, mind, reaction and soul of the main character. This original approach connects well both the adults and children, emotionally engaging, entertaining, visually colorful and inspiring. The level of intellectual and emotional daring are consistent until the end of this major emotion animation, reminding audiences the balancing of all these five feelings that leads to the human's capability of love and affection.",

The story is simple a girl named Reilly has a happy ordinary life with her family and these little emotions in her head keep her happy thanks to the lead emotion Joy, but the family suddenly moves and now she and Joy must come to terms that things have to change, Joy is basically the protagonist and her voice acting is amazing, as I've said she's mainly the leader amongst all the other emotions but during the adventure has to learn the importance of the emotions and how they should share in the duty to shape Reilly's life. Sadness is her exact opposite (and it's easy to tell why) and no one really knows why he's there but at the end he pulls through with everyone learning about his importance.

Inside Out, Pixar's well-oiled new feature, boldly ups the ante on the studio's penchant for high-concept family entertainments: Most of the film takes place in the mind of an 11-year-old girl, and its central crisis revolves around the fungibility of memory. Director Pete Docter envisions the human mind as a sort of ongoing board meeting, where five primary emotions engage in the immediate tasks of impulse-governing and crisis-management in front of a vast backdrop of core values and archived memories, which constitute our consistent yet constantly evolving identities. Inside Out's plot is little more than an excuse to tour this massive expanse of what turns out to be rigorously demarcated emotional terrain; as such, Docter's film often feels both wonderfully complex and weirdly reductive at the same time. That formula, though, seems as sound an embodiment of the human brain as any other.",

When people see movies from Pixar they expect the emotions to be evenly balanced between being 50% funny and 50% serious, but in Inside Out ventures out into a subject that requires a very knowledgeable understanding of the depth of the topic, but since it's their first time trying to get that serious, they did that to the best of their abilities and left a very big and important tone for the viewers to absorb, and that tone is not a stranger to anybody because we all go through these thing every day, and you know what? Change, is very dangerous and beautiful thing that is inside us all, and Riley was going through a very big change that threw her onto paths and roads less taken, and on second thought, Inside Out might as well be another Pixar masterpiece not for the animation or the voice acting, but for it's heart wrenching tone that people are looking for ways to coexist with in their lives, and in this film that tone is sent and received to everybody watched the film.",

The Incredibles had humour that was at most times for the adults. Inside Out has humour that kids and adults will both enjoy. Monsters University failed in that as most of the humour was geared more towards children. Another thing I loved about this film was that it was so colourful, believable (yes believable) and really made you question what you know. I was sitting in the theatre thinking, how do the emotions have other emotions when they are the emotions themselves. But then I remembered, it's a cartoon. I shouldn't say cartoon. It's an animated feature. Now for the reason iI rated it 8 and not 10. Inside Out is short, and at times it feels rushed. In that rushed time it introduces many characters, and many which are obsolete and not needed. It also feels like the heartfelt ending is also a little rushed and did not give me the feeling I got from watching Monsters Inc. But, every film has it's flaws.

      "text": "Another Pixar masterpiece. Inside Out is visually stunning and meaningfully captivating. The idea of tacking the topic of emotions and succesfully put it into an animated family movie is brilliant. It starts with a typical introduction of the characters that ingeniously transforms into a wild and touching plot. As soon as Riley's family move out of their hometown and have a new life in San Francisco the emotions in Riley's head try to figure out how to work with this drastic change. Joy is vibrant and full of life that leads the other emotions so that Riley will be happy and somewhat isolating Sadness out of the picture. As soon as things turn against them. Joy and Sadness are given a journey that will make them understand each other's purpose. Meanwhile the other emotions try to control Riley and end up making her emotionally confused. Towards the end Joy discovers that Sadness has a great part in the development of Riley. The message of the movie is clear. There won't be joy without sadness. Another lesson that Pixar instills in the minds of children, but surprisingly adults can also relate to this movie. Parents can relate and understand how their children feel and how great of a part Joy and Sadness play in our lives. This movie is one of the best animated movies ever crafted. It shows a great lesson and discovery in its viewers. Absolutely heartfelt and meaningful. It leaves you thinking about it and its very mature but important topic. Pixar outdid itself again. Releasing something close to the heart something viewers haven't felt since the first Toy Story.  It is a compilation of all of Pixar's movies in one bright and heart piercing beauty.",

It also has a really interesting idea and I like the little things like \"the train of the thought\" and \"long term memory\". Those were really nice touches. The humour was a lot better than the recent Pixar films, and the characters are really likable. Despite this, while the characters are likable, we don't feel sorry for them like we do in other Pixar films like \"Up\" and \"Finding Nemo\". Also the film is kind of similar ton a 90's sitcom- Herman's head, even though I haven't seen it. Inside out has brought a comeback to the Pixar movies and is up there with the greatest animated films.",

The girl also seems to young to be undergoing such a large shift into depression, and the fact that she is depressed is never actually highlighted in the movie.
