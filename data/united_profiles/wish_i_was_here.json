When I saw it, one contributing member of the audience stayed thru the credits to see her name\u2026alas, she was not one of the few selected from the 46K contributors. She was disappointed and so was I (for different reasons). Braff plays an unsuccessful actor, who's supported by wife Kate Hudson and trying to raise 2 kids. It has tastes of the quirky style he demonstrated in \"Garden State,\" but it's trying too hard to find that left-field charm. Then comes his father's death, which permeates the final act with tedious drama. While it's well enough directed and the performances are fine, his ambitious but unsuccessful script drags the whole thing down.",

      "text": "Plot/Story: \"Wish I Was Here\" in a few words is Cliche and Predictable. Every single thing that happens it's like \"Yup knew it\". There are absolutely zero surprises in this movie. A good film should be unpredictable and leave you with no clue on what is to happen next.  It is also very \"Cliche\". You will find very little here that has not already been done in many other films. These two points are big ones that take away from the whole movie. The comedy also was not that great. I feel like there was no in between. Either the jokes were hilarious or they flat lined. As the movie went on the jokes became less funny.  The beginning of the movie showed quite a lot of potential. All the comedy was nice, the plot looked like it would go in another direction, and it looked enjoyable. You don't really care for the characters at all because you have seen it all before. None of this is terrible...... It is just mediocre. 4/10",
