While it could be a perfect film, the director created a blemish by making the story Romeo and Juliet, when it is meant as Don Quixote. The almost cubist, many-sided Gatsby is more than a schmoozing opportunist because of his capacity for illusion  that's what makes him \"great\"  leaving him more than a little absurd in the emerging modernist world. He can't see that his earnest, midwestern, pioneering spirit now reaches for something fundamentally careless, insincere, and artificial, like Daisy Buchanan; this movie wrongly gives the impression of tragically unconsummated mutual devotion.

I found the story of the film to be pretty well written. It's very interesting, and with its fine acting, the film kept me off the edge of my seat, anticipating what will happen next. I have yet to read the book, so I have no idea how much it stays true to the source novel. The cast does a great job as their roles.  Leonardo and Toby kill it as their roles, as they are the best actors in the entire film. The rest does great as well, though I think that some actors had potential to do more in the film. My favorite aspect of the movie is the visuals and the music. The film is visually exciting, as there are colors all over the place. this is best evident during the party scenes. The music is very catchy, and I constantly find myself humming along to the tunes this film has to offer. Really my only problem with this film certain scenes. I felt that there were a few scenes that were trying to go for something emotional to happen, but it never really got there, let alone didn't try to. For example, the scene where Tom and Myrtle break up could have gone somewhere in the film, but the characters never speak any dialogue again. Aside from these select scenes, The Great Gatsby is visually charming, well acted, and musically catchy, making up for what I believe is the best film of the year so far.",

Also, Carey Mulligan and Isla Fisher should've switched their respective roles as Daisy and Myrtle: the casting choices there were not great. Each woman would've played the other character better, and the movie would've benefitted greatly.

It is as if Luhrmann reached into Fitzgerald's vision of the 20's, pulled out the heart of it and merged it with what society is today, over nine decades later. Alongside personal strife, we see social inequality, abuse of drugs and alcohol, political and moral corruption, and the failure of financial institutions and their responsibility to people. This film will make you feel that these issues will always be relevant, and that not much changes from generation to generation.",

I've not read the book and frankly the plot seems very generic. A man from humble beginnings rises through society for the sake of winning the girl he lost several years ago. Yet the book is hailed as 'The Great American Novel.' I don't know why that is, but the movie only shines because of Leo. That man knows the most intimate secrets of playing a character and bringing it to life. Of course one may argue that there was no electronic music and rap in the 1920s, and yet Moulin Rouge! didn't seem to have historical accuracy going against it when it received critical acclaim, as I don't think Nirvana existed in the nineteenth century.

The Great Gatsby is a very beautiful story and well told through miraculous cinematography, some visuals and fantastic acting. Hands down, Leonardo DiCaprio is the heart and soul of the movie. I mean, he's just such a tremendous actor. It may not be his biggest and best role, but he still gives one hell of a performance (just as usual). There were some even some other great actors such as Joel Edgerton, Carey Mulligan and even Tobey Maguire. I honestly wasn't sure if I would like him in this movie but he actual is really good. But his best role for me will always be in \"Brothers\". The cinematography is definitely one of the things that impressed me the most. Cinematographer Simon Duggan really knows how to not only get great shots, but take you through the world of Jay Gatsby himself. The one thing I really don't understand is this. Why is there a 3-D release for this movie? I mean, it has those good shots, but honestly it doesn't need to be shot in 3-D. That's like making \"The Notebook\" in 3-D. It just doesn't work. But don't let that distract you from watching an (Oscar worthy) type-movie. If your going to go watch it, watch it in 2-D. But overall, it's a beautifully crafted story of drama and romance.",

This film is pure eye candy, yet it does have some substance beneath it and I think it did a swell job capturing the essence of the novel and telling the fateful tale of Jay Gatsby. In addition, the acting, led by Tobey Maguire, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Carey Mulligan, was great as well.",

      "text": "With any  Baz Luhrmann film you expect  high camp anachronistic pyrotechnics, but  whereas Moulin Rouge worked extremely well, Gatsby doesn't. The main problem is that it's setting and story is less appropriate for this over the top kind of  approach. Moulin Rouge was set in a musical revue nightclub and therefore all the outrageous antics could be more readily embraced. The first half feels like Luhrmann wanted to make a musical and was taken with the ides of wild parties, decadence and lavish costumes only to discover halfway through that he had a story to finish telling. In fact it's only when Gatsby turns to 'straight' drama that it works at all. Generally it's a visually stunning mess, although even here everyone and every thing is so perfectly positioned and placed that the artifice in scene after scene wins the day. Performances are unexceptional although DiCaprio acquits himself well. There is less to be said for Tobey Maguire. His performance as neighbour and story narrator Nick Carraway, is bland and borders on the boring. The writing is trite and often undermines the visual style. For all the criticisms that have been levelled at the 1974 Redford/Farrow film, it must be said that the writing, acting and screenplay were all superior to this frenetic self indulgence. On the plus side the main musical theme is just beautiful.",

Unfortunately, not true to the flavor and depth of this great novel, Director and Co-writer Baz Luhrmann gives us a glitzy overdone film with no depth or intensity but, instead, the shallowness of a music video. First, a disclaimer. I am no fan of either Tobey maguire or of Mr. DiCaprio and with these precommitted feelings, it\u2019s difficult to enjoy any vehicle either of them are in, let alone both. Mr. maguire whines his way through this overdone narrative and Mr. DiCaprio continues to look like a teenager trying to play an adult. If he uttered the phrase \u201cold spoaht\u201d one more time in the film, I would\u2019ve thrown my 3D glasses at the screen. Speaking of that, this film has no dimension so the need to try to see it in 3D is useless. I at one point took off the glasses and could not honestly tell the difference. So visually and substantively, the film lacks so much except one thing\u2026..time. This lifeless seemingly never ending film lasts for 2 and  hours and screams for an editor\u2019s splicing machine. The special effects and scenery, as costly as they may have been, seems to be the impetus for the movie\u2019s length since it\u2019s hard to put so much set money on the floor of the editing room. The old \u201chow many times did I look at my watch\u201d test proved accurate for I recall no less than 6. This Gatsy is neither \u2018great\u2019 nor \u2018good\u2019 and, at best, is mediocre.  As bad as the 1974 version of the film with Robert Redford and Mia Farrow was, this is probably worse. I give the film a rating of 3.The viewers, F.

The cast is stunning all around, from Jason Clarke's unstable Wilson to DiCaprio's glowing Gatsby, the performances are A-list. Tobey Maguire was brilliant as Nick Carraway, capturing the dry wit that Fitzgerald frequently utilized in the original novel. Unfortunately, it is not until the final act of the film that Luhrmann's direction truly allows the cast to genuinely act. The movie's first two acts were more focused on the glitz and glamour of the Roarin' Twenties than effectively setting the scene. Nonetheless, the colors of this adaptation are a breathe of fresh air in comparison to previous efforts. Overall, despite having an excess of flash and a sometimes effective (\"Love is Blindness\" at the film's climax)-often inappropriate (Jay-Z's \"$100 Bill\" used literally whenever the director saw fit) inclusion of modern rock and hip-hop into what is supposed to be a classic Jazz Age story, Luhrmann's clear passion for the work and a perfect cast more than makes up for it. Definitely worth the $9.50",

The acting is superb, with Leonardo handing in a typical mesmerizing performance, while Toby Maguire stuns as Nick. Joel Edgerton and Carey Mulligan give the genuine nature of Tom and Daisy, while maintaining the vast carelessness of the two that's necessary for the magic. Lhurmann's masterpiece doesn't transport me back to the 20's, or to Gatsby's parties, but instead takes me into the heart of a man clung on hope, hope that tomorrow we WILL stretch our arms farther. That's where Lhurmann goes right, he captures the spirit of the novel, a feat that is worthy of praise.",

      "text": "I think that, ultimately, The Great Gatsby is a success for Baz, and especially for the actors. Personally, I feel that Baz's over-the-top style works for the source material, where major themes include materialism, greed, and flaunting of wealth. I think that the movie does an amazing job of commenting on all of the social aspects that are discussed in Fitzgerald's novel. The only reason I could see people being upset about this film is because of the soundtrack. Personally, I loved the integration of old and new music, I think it is a good way to bring Gatsby to a moder audience and it shows how relevant the novel still is, but I could see where people would not agree. Besides the directing and scenic design, I also think that the acting was superb. DiCaprio did an amazing job portraying the complicated character that is Gatsby. Edgerton and Mulligan did a great job portraying the Buchanans. I also liked how many of the lines in the script came *directly* from the novel, for instance \"Gatsby, What Gatsby?\" is one of the most famous lines in literature, and I was excited to see that it was kept in, along with many others. Only two things really bothered me about the film. 1, the insistant words that showed up on screen. It would have been fine for one or two scenes, but it became annoying after a while in my opinion. And 2, the fact that Nick Carraway has discussions with a doctor throughout the film to write a book about Gatsby, I dont understand why it could not have been narrated without an excuse of an explanation, which was not in the original novel.",

I enjoyed the movie, the story, and the characters, but there were a few sappy moments as well. I felt a bit torn between realism and fantasy and which one the director wanted me to be.  Leonardo and Toby \"made\" the movie and without them, it could have been a yawner.

Since the dark romantic edge of Romeo  Juliet and the goofy over the top musical of Moulin Rouge, The Great Gatsby takes the new wonderful  view of F. Scott Fitzgerald's greatest novel. In 1920's, Nick Carraway (Tobey Maguire) is a bond salesman who tells his story about Jay Gatsby (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a mysterious businessman who lives a rich mansion and he desperately fells in love with Daisy (Carey Mulligan) who still lives with her rich husband, Tom (Joel Edgerton). Carraway spends quality time with Gatsby at the huge party that has a terrific design sets and a good looking people. Gatsby and Daisy are fell in love for a long time and they both have a good chemistry to each other. The Great Gatsby is a nicely well done movie with great acting, great effects, and great characters. The visuals are very astounding, while watching in 3D. Tobey Maguire did really good job as Nick Carraway and finally return his acting career since the Spider-Man Trilogy. Leonardo DiCaprio did a fantastic job for portraying as Jay Gatsby in his good looks and acting like Orsen Welles. Even though I'm not a huge fan of Baz Luhrmann's work for his fast paced and his over the top performances, but I think the film did a really good job and Luhrmann has a great taste for making a huge poetic film. Much more better than Romeo  Juliet or Moulin Rouge, but at least it has flaws. Thumbs Up.",

Fortunately the movie eventually slows down and starts delivering a much more profound and interesting film. The scenes become longer and much more significant, and the performances from the great cast start to flourish. Leonardo DiCaprio is the highlight, delivering a very credible Gatsby that fits perfectly within the lines of the book. That is with Joel Edgerton also delivering an incredible performance as Tom. At the end. the movie then becomes a smooth combination of great story, acting and amazing cinematography, but never letting the latter outshine the former like it did in  the first 15 minutes or so.

      "text": "I wish \u201cThe Great Gatsby\u201d had opted to be either much more faithful or much less faithful to Fitzgerald's novel.  As it was, the film\u2019s fidelity, especially early on, made its ultimate departures dismaying--at least to this lover of both Fitzgerald's writing and Luhrmann's films.  It was as though the director was perfectly happy to party with the novelist but didn\u2019t want to endure the brutal clarity of his hangover.  The worst offenders, for me, were the kinder, gentler Daisy and Tom.  In the novel, though superficially charming, they are, at heart, cruel, greedy and self-obsessed; in the film, they are flawed but relatively sympathetic.  And, to make that work, Luhrman makes Gatsby less sympathetic--and he makes Nick\u2019s admiration for Gatsby deeply suspect.  During the final showdown at the Plaza Hotel, for example, Luhrmann's Gatsby becomes physically violent, alarming Daisy, who then decides to leave him.  In the novel, Gatsby's violence is limited to a fleeting facial expression, and Daisy's terror has multiple causes, not least the intrusion of real passions into her elaborate social game.  In the film, right after Myrtle is killed, Tom points her vengeful husband at Gatsby, as the driver of the \"death car.\"  Perfectly understandable: Gatsby normally drives the car, and Tom is distraught over the death of his lover.  In the novel, however, Tom fingers Gatsby the following day, AFTER learning that Gatsby is innocent and his own wife the killer.  That's a whole 'nother level of depravity, and, for me, it's much more interesting than \"he did it because he was grieving,\" a tired motive that appears on TV at least a hundred times per week.  So what does Luhrman achieve by making Fitzgerald's characters more familiar and formulaic while preserving so much of Fitzgerald's language and plot?  For one thing, he backs away from the idea that vast, unearned wealth can be corrupting, as can vast differences between the \u201chaves\u201d and the \u201chave nots.\u201d  Moreover, from the moment he introduces Nick as a mental patient, he decides for us that Gatsby was more deluded fool than idealist, whereas Fitzgerald was careful to keep the two possibilities balanced.  These, for me, are losses.  While I have no problem with plot or character changes, generally--I loved Luhrmann\u2019s tweaking of \u201cRomeo and Juliet,\u201d for instance--there has to be a payoff, and I don\u2019t see one here, unless you count instant recognition as a virtue, which, I suppose, billions of McDonald\u2019s customers do.  Finally, a word about the film's music.  When I heard Filter\u2019s \u201cHappy Together\u201d in a preview, I got excited.  After the mostly edgeless tunes and sappy baladeering of \u201cMoulin Rouge,\u201d I was ready for some thrilling music to accompany Luhrmann\u2019s thrilling visuals.  But thrills turned out to be in short supply.  I liked Jay Z\u2019s \u201c$100 Bill\u201d for the speakeasy scene, which was appropriately urban and decadent, but some of the other hip-hop tunes clashed badly with the anti-urban milieu of the Hamptons.  The most egregious misfire, however, was Lana Del Ray\u2019s \u201cYoung and Beautiful\u201d as the theme song of Gatsby and Daisy\u2019s renewed love.  \u201cWill you still love me when I\u2019m no longer young and beautiful?\u201d asks the song, over and over, a question utterly irrelevant to the reunion, after five years, of a man cherishing a beautiful illusion and a woman seeking diversion.  I can only conclude that Luhrmann and his music director, Anton Monsted, think audiences don\u2019t listen to song lyrics.  I also question Monsted\u2019s taste (he did \u201cMoulin Rouge,\u201d too), which I find too reliant on what is--or has been--at the top of the charts.  He strikes me as a man who listens to popular radio and little else, making most of his musical choices obvious, boring, and ill-suited to their dramatic contexts.  I\u2019ve heard much better music on TV shows such as \u201cThe Sopranos,\u201d \u201cLife,\u201d and \u201cSons of Anarchy,\u201d and I wish Luhrmann would hire one of their music supervisors (or me) for his next film.",

But later on in the film, the flaws of the first half begin to fade (though they reappear sometimes) and the film starts to feel more like a 1920s drama film rather than an over-the-top bizarre stage play music video. The film, to be honest, didn't need to be as visually impressive as it is and the 3D, though good at times, didn't need to be present. Besides a pretty robotic performance from Carey Mulligan, the acting was often solid, though every actor and actress had their fair-share of over-the-top and campy moments.

      "text": "Absolutely a beautifully shot movie. Each frame of the film looks almost like a painting. This film is drenched with color and has brilliant filming The largest problems in this film is that it features a soundtrack that is contemporary music mixed with music that is more to the time period of the film. Surprisingly the contemporary music works in most instances however there is one or two times where the much more modern contemporary music seems out of place. The other major flaw is that so much time was spent in this movie on it's stylistic looks which as i said earlier were flawless but so much time and effort was spent on these that it seems to have taken away from the character development side of the film. While there are many scenes that are pretty I wish they would have sacrificed some of those to develop characters other than Gatsby and Carraway.",

On the other hand the Beyonce and other Hip-Hop songs were well not well contrived. Good  the way the city is set up with the labor class supporting the upper class was done in an almost cartoonish way that was very beautiful. The acting was great and the actress playing Daisy steals every scene she is in. The omissions from the original story  Bad.

      "text": "E\u2019 il poco prolifico australiano Baz Luhrmann a prendersi il rischio di scrivere (assieme a Craig Pearce) e a filmare la terza versione per il grande schermo dell\u2019opera pi\u00f9 conosciuta di Francis Scott Fitzgerald, romanzo che ha dato parecchio filo da torcere ai propri adattamenti cinematografici. Per provare a vincerne la sfida, il regista d\u00e0 alla storia una confezione molto modernista, disegnando degli anni Venti davvero ruggenti, in cui dominano colori netti e brillanti che ben si inseriscono in un d\u00e9cor a dir poco sovrabbondante: ad amplificarne l\u2019effetto pensa poi una colonna sonora che unisce l\u2019arrembante musica dell\u2019et\u00e0 del charleston con inserti hip-hop  uno dei produttori esecutivi  Jay-Z  che sottolineano ancor di pi\u00f9 la frenesia del periodo (il che porta a infischiarsene maggiormente di altri anacronismi, tipo la \u2018Rapsodia in blue\u2019 che non era ancora stata scritta al momento in cui si svolge l\u2019azione). Con alcuni passaggi coreografati quasi come un balletto  la gestione delle finestre nella villa dei  Buchanan, l\u2019arredamento floreale della casa di Nick  la prima parte viene raccontata come una grande fiaba, con i due castelli che si fronteggiano dalle parti opposte della baia, quello sfavillante del principe biondo e quello in cui vive prigioniera la bella di cui lui  innamorato: il tutto raccontato dallo scudiero che serve da collegamento, almeno parziale, con una realt\u00e0 che pu\u00f2 essere molto lontana dalle feste organizzate da Gatsby. Quando la favola che il protagonista principale si era costruito si incrina, il contatto dei due mondi  quello di chi ha troppo e quello di chi ha troppo poco  apre le porte alla tragedia, rivelando s\u00ec la vera, controversa identit\u00e0 del personaggio, ma soprattutto la povert\u00e0 umana e morale di una classe benestante a cui anche Daisy aderisce alla perfezione, ben lontana dall\u2019immagine idealizzata da Gatsby. Purtroppo, per\u00f2, proprio nel momento in cui il pathos della storia dovrebbe raggiungere il culmine, il film comincia a perdere qualche colpo, quasi che, venuta a mancare la sovrastruttura luccicante, la scrittura smarrisca il giusto ritmo in una serie di situazioni trascinate troppo per le lunghe. Anche nell\u2019ultimo terzo di pellicola non mancano i momenti belli e le intuizioni efficaci  come quando le lettere che giocano sullo schermo finiscono per formare le intense parole di Fitzgerald lette dalla voce narrante di Nick oppure nel richiamo, attraverso le ultime inquadrature della piscina, dell\u2019incipit di \u2018Viale del tramonto\u2019  si finisce per sbirciare l\u2019orologio qualche volta di troppo, con la conseguenza di raffreddare l\u2019emotivit\u00e0. Fa capolino cos\u00ec il sospetto che, seppur in modo meno grave che altrove, la cura per la confezione abbia finito per essere prevalente rispetto a quella riservata al contenuto (il film  distribuito anche in un superfluo 3D): a soffrirne  il giudizio complessivo che, pur senza dubbio migliore rispetto agli adattamenti precedenti, finisce per essere inferiore all\u2019aspettativa creata dalla somma delle parti., Fra queste ultime, spicca la prova di un cast davvero affiatato: DiCaprio, che gi\u00e0 aveva lavorato con Luhrmann in \u2018Romeo e Giulietta\u2019, aggiunge un solido mattone alla costruzione della sua carriera vestendo alla meglio i panni di un altro personaggio pi\u00f9 grande della vita, mentre il suo amico (anche nella realt\u00e0) Maguire dimostra ancora una volta di avere la faccia giusta per interpretare chi si trova a osservare con stupore quel che di inatteso gli capita. Se poi Carey Mulligan disegna una Daisy dolce e indecifrabile (ma che meraviglia erano mai i tagli a caschetto?), in caso di scelta obbligata del migliore la preferenza cadrebbe forse su Joel Edgerton alle prese con lo scomodo ruolo di suo marito Tom. Azzeccati anche i ruoli di contorno  Jason Clarke fa ancora una volta il ruvido  fra i quali spunta, in una particina monobattuta da guidatore di taxi, Nick Tate: per i maniaci (come me) l\u2019indimenticato pilota di Aquile in \u2018Spazio 1999\u2019.",

Perhaps more a film of a 'Great Gatsby' fairy tale than the novel, struggling through slightly trippy 3D and an admittedly intelligent parallelism with between 20's and contemporary culture.  It omitted multiple areas of symbolism, the most exasperating of which being the infantile interpretation of Gatsby's love for Daisy, avoiding the true messages of delusion and futile aspiration. This could be tolerated if the dialogue wasn't selected with such a bias as to ignore other allegories and messages. This being said, Lurhrmann's interpretation, however devoid of substance, was perfectly carried out by an ever-charming DiCaprio, with a surprisingly intimate performance by still-faced Elizabeth Debicki. But this saw itself ever overshadowed by crude hyperbole regarding the Valley of Ashes, all exacerbated a simplified representation of Daisy.

The Great Gatsby was a decent film, there was a lot that I liked and a lot that I just flat out didn\u2019t like; all which stems back to the way it was directed. Like all Baz Luhrmann directed films, Baz Luhrman is the star of the show. His whimsical, almost animated, way of telling a story shines bright in this picture; from those wild camera angles, startling soundtrack, hasty editing, and flamboyant set designs and not to mention the eccentric performances he extracts from his cast. While much of his flare worked well for those party sequences, I felt the film itself was far too off-the-wall for its own good. I am hardly convinced that this was the direction he should have taken, but at no point in time did it leave me bored. Do not fret too much, the visuals did not get in the way of the romantic aspects of the story; as it was delivered to the screen in a respectable manner. What I was really bothered by was the way some of the intricacies of F. Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s exquisite story were taken away, in favor of style and visual intricacies. I believe this hindered the dark social commentary on the wealthy and the nature their moral detachment; which was quite disappointing. But, what can I say\u2026 such style! Catherine Martin\u2019s fantastic costumes and sets were characters of their own. Clearly my view on the film and the way it was made is very much mixed; but one thing I appreciated without a doubt was Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s performance as Gatsby. Gatsby\u2019s bold attempt to reach for that green light and regain his love, Daisy, is noble yet foolish. However, you can\u2019t help but relate to this character, as it\u2019s sometimes easier to hold on to hope than to let go completely. While not perfect, DiCaprio made a fine Gatsby in my opinion.",

The film simply doesn't hold together like an oscar contender. Having said that, the movie is worth checking out. #seeit",

Though the more accurate word is probably that I didn't comprehend all of what it was trying to say I still have yet to re-visit the novel since my sophomore year, but as I sat down to experience the latest film adaptation of the novel by the often flamboyant and always stylish director Baz Luhrman the parts of the story that I vaguely recalled seemed to escape me completely and I was then able to completely embrace the extravagant world in which Luhrman and his team had created for the audience to dig into and become all the better acquainted with the specific time period, the social climate, and the characters that it is necessary to care about before we become entranced with their melodramatic lives. It is to be understood that through the glitz and the glamour of the roaring twenties that this is essentially what F. Scott Fitzgerald's great American novel was if not a high form of it wrapped in commentary for the societal issues of the changing culture during that time. Though it would be easy to dismiss the film as a case of style over substance I was completely on board from the very beginning as the caliber of the cast here was able to elevate what might have been an otherwise overlooked aspect of the production. The depth each actor brings to his or her character lend an emphasis to the themes Fitzgerald touched upon and they are only embellished by Luhrman's preference to have everything as big and excessive as possible. It is a film that entices by the fantasy of the world it exists in and it holds our attention by being consistently stylish and letting it's cast bring their A-game that in turn creates a combination that captures the essence of everything I expected and wanted this film to be.",

However, it's long running time of nearly 21/2 hours and a near-constant bombardment of visual over-stimulation might make the film somewhat exhausting for some. Every bit as visually dazzling as one might expect with it's production, grand sets, scenery, and detailed costume designs. I personally feel that while this film doesn't necessarily belongs to the category of overblown, over-elaborate movies out there, it could have benefited from having a less dazzling tone.

The cast is selling it, we actually get to know these characters and do a good job. Luhrmann does screw up the realism but it's a fun ravishing movie with great clothing design and intoxicating breathless party scenes and brainy dialogue. Screenwriter Craig Pearce and Baz Luhrmann (whom Luhrmann wrote the script) do a pretty astonishing job writing 20's brainy dialogue and a having dreamlike quality to the film. DiCaprio and Carey Mulligan have some okay  \"Romeo and Juliet\" chemistry also Tobey Maguire was great too as the narrorator also a loyal friend to Gastby.

This aspect of the film bugged me at first, but I quickly got used to it, falling into the surreal fantasy of Gatsby's world. I found this movie very entertaining and fun, all while being clever. The film had a very exaggerated feel to it, like a play on broadway. At first it was distracting but the style grew on me as the movie progressed. So I have to say acting was pretty good, Leonardo DiCaprio knocked it out of the park as usual with a great performance. On more of the downside the film lacked a sense of reality and pushed characters past the point of being believable.

The novel was first adapted in 1926 as a silent film starring Warner Baxter and Lois Wilson, then again in 1949 with Alan Ladd and Betty Field in the lead roles. Then, once again in 1974 starring Robert Redford and Mia Farrow. But this one, in 2013 had something to deliver...it had Baz Luhrmann in the director's chair, the famous director best known for his more modern take on \"Romeo and Juliet\" in 1996, and he directed the elaborate and eccentric musical that is 'Moulin Rouge' (2001).",

That fact of the matter is that I will absolutely still love this film when its no longer young. Sure, some may criticize its lack of subtlety and tender pace that were characteristic of The Great Gatsby novel, but few can deny this film's masterful portrayal of key characters and the orgastic yet sickly vibe of the so-called \"Roaring Twenties.\" Heart-shattering the plot, amazing the visuals, and skilled are the cast in this ambitious interpretation of Fitzgerald's book. Make sure to read the book before seeing The Great Gatsby, as it does speed by some important ideas at the pace of a motion picture.",
