It does not feel like a television movie. What it does do successfully is force us to take seriously the water privatization issue. Why is it that so often in American cinema, when a film is actually about something that matters, and challenges the mainstream corporate-CIA narrative of good vs. evil, right vs. wrong, the critics or the public, or both, are reluctant to hear the message? The performances of Andy Garcia, Kim Coates and Deborah Kara Unger are noteworthy, though Forest Whitaker is somewhat lackluster in this role, as if he could not quite commit to the part. I give \"A Dark Truth\" high marks, as a capable thriller that is actually about something, and not just another shoot 'em up.",

You do understand after 5 years of Hope and Change Communism by the Democrats that today's US Labor force participation rate is LOWEST since 1979? You do understand that Communism has failed everywhere it's ever been tried on the face of the planet, don't you?

Most of the focus is on Andy Garcia & Forest Whitaker, and Deborah Kara Unger & Kim Coates (Kevin Durand is great in a supporting role). They play off of each other well, the plot has serious weight, and the single big action set-piece (near the end) has good tension and camera work (though the film is generally slow-moving until that point). Perhaps a little heavy-handed with its message, but still worth a watch because it highlights an issue (water rights) that I think not many people know or care about.",
