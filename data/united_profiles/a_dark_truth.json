It does not feel like a television movie. What it does do successfully is force us to take seriously the water privatization issue. Why is it that so often in American cinema, when a film is actually about something that matters, and challenges the mainstream corporate-CIA narrative of good vs. evil, right vs. wrong, the critics or the public, or both, are reluctant to hear the message? The performances of Andy Garcia, Kim Coates and Deborah Kara Unger are noteworthy, though Forest Whitaker is somewhat lackluster in this role, as if he could not quite commit to the part. I give \"A Dark Truth\" high marks, as a capable thriller that is actually about something, and not just another shoot 'em up.",
