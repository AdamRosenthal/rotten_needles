I couldn't wait to see this, and the first half of the movie met and went beyond my expectations. But this was just the first half, the second half contradicts the plot of the movie and makes the whole concept ridiculous.  The first half of the movie is an excellent movie about a haunting, whereas the second half is a paranormal search into the ghost's world.  Without giving anything away, I want to give you an example of how much this plot contradicts and stretches the movie's plot.  Imagine your watching 'The Notebook' and midway through the movie, it turns into 'Mortal Kombat,' pretty drastic change in pacing and plot right?? Well that's what Insidious felt like.  The Good:  The first half of the movie delivers scares and creeps, movie has a great spooky environment, decent enough acting (nothing to brag about).  The Bad:  Unnecessary plot twist which blew the simple but effective concept way out of proportion, and plot holes.  The first half of this film was amazing, a definite 10, but it just went on a downward's spiral from there",

Having beautiful cinematography and thrills and scares is not quite enough to have a very good film, though. There are some things in the film that just make no sense, and are definite loop-holes that the director and screenplay writers missed. The acting is not necessarily the best - the dialogue, especially, feels rather artificial at times, especially when the wife and husband talk.

The scares were effective but to my distaste were pretty much all jump scares, a technique that I feel is very overused and cliche.

      "text": "Overall, I thought this film was okay. I'm a fan of Rose Byrne, I think she's a hugely underrated actress and so I had high hopes for this film, but I was a little disappointed. Horror is my favourite and most watched genre and as such I didn't think that this film really offered up anything new. Firstly the good. Elements of this film were undoubtedly creepy. Certain aspects of the storyline were chilling and the overall concept was, I thought, quite original. In other words, it wasn't your typical 'haunted house' story where things go bump and people scream (but never seem to move house....), so for that I was grateful. Also, I think what ruins a lot of horror films is when someone does something that makes you think 'Well I wouldn't have done that' (like walking into a scary room without looking for a light, no one in the history of mankind has ever done that...) because that disconnects you from the action and makes you sit there with a slightly unimpressed look on your face at how stupid the person on screen seems to be. But this film didn't really have any of those moments, they all seemed to be fairly rational, sensible people making fairly rational, sensible decisions. That made the whole story better for me. !However! There came a point where that was no longer the case. What started off as a genuinely uncomfortable and creepy film turned into what I thought was a bit like a Michael Jackson 'Thriller' video out-take. I went from, 'well there goes any hope of me sleeping for the next ten years', to '....did that really just happen (insert appropriate unimpressed face here)' in the space of about 30 minutes. I felt like the plot got too ahead of itself and everyone went a bit CGI crazy. Elements were still scary, but I felt like the film started to rely too much on jump scares than actual, real terror moments. Anyone would jump if you made a loud noise and shoved a scary picture in their face, to me that isn't the same and just produces moments that are totally forgettable. So on the whole, I thought this film was okay. Parts were original, well thought out and outright creepy but the direction that the film went in let it down completely. A great film if you're with a friend and want to have a few scares but nothing I can see being remembered any time in the near future.",

      "text": "Insidious is a modern day portal of the Haunted House Movie. It's nothing we haven't seen before. Sprits linger around and everyone freaks out trying to save a young kid. It's really that simple. There are a few complex twists and turns but it's no wonder that the producer of Paranormal Activity would produce another film just like it. (Arn't the sequels enough to punish us with?) I will give credit where credit is due, but only where credit is due. Insidious did something that must horror films of today cannot, it made me jump. That's all it did though. For the first time sense The House of the Devil back in 2009 I felt scared watching a film. It surprised me at first and I was taken into the story line. However, the last forty minutes of this film were so random, out there and completely ridiculous that I could no longer enjoy the film. I sat through the last twenty minutes begging for it to just be over. James Wan the director of Saw has swam in the glory of the franchise ever since it launched his career in 2004, but after his last failed attempt with Dead Silence back in 2007 did any of us really expect anything more from James Wan with Insidious. Sure he successfully got Oren Peli to produce the film but after the success of Paranormal Activity this guy has been throwing himself at everything horror. The simple conclusion is that the names advertised with this film are a bunch of one hit wonders.  The film was as cheesy as they come with a dumb down completely ridiculous story line. I could hardly even bare watching the last twenty minutes. However, for the first time in almost two years I was scared. It made me jump and if that's the only reason that you watch horror movies then this film is for you. That's all it's going to do though, it will just make you jump. Insidious is a film for the hardcore horror fans the love films like poltergeist. Everyone else this film is TRASH",

      "text": "For God's sake! Get out! That's the tagline sprawled across the movie poster for Stuart Rosenberg's \"The Amityville Horror\", the 1979 shocker about the haunted goings-on at George and Kathy Lutz's Long Island residence, adapted from the supposed non-fiction bestseller by Jay Anson. The promotional admonition has the unintentional effect of drawing a bead on that most annoying of all haunted house movie tropes, which is the irrationally slow realization on the ghost-afflicted victims' part that they don't actually have to coexist with the growing menace. They can, in fact, leave, right after the first unexplained door slam. The Lutzs, in particular, are especially obstinate in their steadfast refusal to flee like normal people, holding down the fort as they do til the last possible moment, even though the daughter communicates with a dead girl. Also, George's demonic possession is confused for the flu, and the flies attack like piranhas. Best of all, nobody seems adequately fazed by the portal to hell that the family dog first sniffs out in the basement. The Dutch Colonial literally has to ooze blood before George and Kathy come to their senses and finally abdicate themselves from the supernatural plot of land. To be fair, if the characters in horror movies could take a hint, the film would be over in a matter of minutes. In a sense, characters in horror movies need to act as if they have brain damage. Characters like the Lutzs have to put themselves in harm's way for the sake of running time. But the best of the bunch, like Oren Peli's \"Paranormal Activity\" and Tobe Hooper's \"Poltergeist\", go through the trouble of providing the terrorized people with a bonafide reason to stay in the house, an incentive for the emotional violence that they'll have to endure during their long, drawn-out ordeal with the unexplained phenomena. As a result, their dealing with the malevolent presence feels more organic to the story, and not merely a screenwriter's contrivance. For instance, in \"Paranormal Activity\", the young couple puts up with the disturbances in their troubled home because Micah is shooting a documentary film. Differing from other like-minded genre fare, for the amateur filmmaker, it's a bad day if nothing out of the ordinary happens. It's in Micah's best interest to be scared. (Not so much, Katie's.) The Steven Spielberg-produced \"Poltergeist\", the movie that \"Insidious\" most resembles, initially anyway, comes equipped with a practical basis for keeping Steve and Diane Freeling(Craig T. Nelson & JoBeth Williams) in their suburban dwelling. The house eats their daughter. They're not going anywhere until their tract home regurgitates Carol Anne(Heather O'Rourke). Homologous in cause, Josh(Patrick Wilson) and Renai(Rose Byrne) aren't going anywhere either, since their son Dalton(Ty Simpkins) needs to find his way back to the body that he transcended through astral projection. Smarter than most genre films of its ilk, the Lamberts leave their thought-to-be haunted home(their first house) midway through the narrative, since Renai, having witnessed enough phantoms to last her a lifetime, doesn't wait for things to get worse. Even better, Josh believes her, foregoing the patented cliche of the skeptic telling the eyewitness that in no certain terms that the person who cries ghost is crazy. In the time-honored tradition of the haunted house movie, by the time the unconverted sees the menace for himself, it's too late, and both eyewitness and former skeptic run for their lives. In \"Insidious\", just like the Tobe Hooper film, a parent has to retrieve the child from the netherworld, a domestic-based interior universe. (In retrospect, the husband in \"Poltergeist\" is kind of a p*ssy for not insisting harder that he should be the one to go retrieve Carol Anne. The wife could have worked the rope.) Ironically, when Josh and Renai change addresses, they are unknowingly abandoning their son, since Dalton's floating self is on the \"further\" side of the house, similar to the Freeling girl's situation. Being smart becomes a wrong move. Being dumb would have kept them closer to their wandering son. On his own, Dalton would have never found the new house had Josh not gone looking for him, when \"Insidious\" visualizes what \"Poltergeist\" only suggests: a dark underworld, a purgatory-like crawl space that traps children. Mick Jones of The Clash once asked, \"Should I Stay or Should I Go,\" and in \"Insidious\", this reasonably scary exercise in genre proves that there's no right move in a horror movie, just like how a nightmare should be.",

      "text": "Insidious is the newest film from duo James Wan (director) and Leigh Whannell (writer/actor) who were made infamous by their first film, Saw. Except this time, instead of starting a sub-genre, they're paying homage to another: the Haunted House genre, which includes films such as The Amityville Horror and House on Haunted Hill. Now as much as I like campy little tribute pictures, like Brutal Massacre or Grindhouse, I usually don't consider them great movies. The reason? As fun as it is to revisit a genre that is otherwise dead and gone, these movies don't really bring anything new to the table. That being said, Insidious was a delightful surprise. It keeps its heart close to home with the classics, but is totally original in both its execution and plot. Now you may think you've seen this movie before - quick shots of people walking by doorways, turns out a brutal multiple-homicide took place there years before, blah blah blah - but I assure you, you're wrong. The film does have some aspects of familiarity to them, there's no denying that, but it also has a refreshing edge that most recent horror films don't have. One of these things is that Insidious EARNS its scares. Yes, it does have the quick shots of things appearing and disappearing, loud noises, and all that jazz, but it also has a shocking number of scenes that rely on build-up and legitimately creepy circumstances instead of the pop-out scares that we're all so familiar with. Unfortunately though, Insidious isn't consistent. For every brilliant scene that is beautifully done, there are at least 3-4 that either don't make a whole lot of sense or are the cheap pop-out style scares. Also, the big reveal into what's going on in this movie was good, but it also missed the mark slightly; other scenes were carried out a bit too long and got a bit too ridiculous. One can see where they were trying to go with it, but it just didn't come out that great. It is unfortunate that this movie wasn't better received; they came so close to being a notable force in the horror genre, which is so desperately needed right now in main stream cinema, and personally I think James and Leigh would fit the bill wonderfully because they have something that very few people don't: heart, and they've got a ton of it.

But I found that the main let down of Insidious was how far it strayed from both Paranormal Activity and Saw, the fact that it was filmed with crystal clear cameras and a lot of CGI, makes the fear we had from Paranormal Activity's CCTV footage and believable ghostly antics (paranormal activity) fade away. All in all the storyline started off well and then takes an outstanding DROP to a point where you think..... I actually think a 5 year old would have thought up a better ending!! (Soo predictable, everyone I know who has seen it said they knew the ending before it happened and so did I) Overall I think it is worth seeing if your in to your horror movies, but do not see it if you want something similar to Saw or Paranormal Activity, whatever you do, do not wait until the DVD is released as the cinema makes the scenes a hundred times better.",

These ghosts definitely make their presences known by running through hallways and wearing really creepy costumes. They're like a combination between the ghosts in \"Carnival of Souls\" and \"The Shining.\" Because of this, \"Insidious\" might not be for everyone. But if you dig old-school horror films, you're in for a treat. James Wan takes his haunted house style of horror and runs with it. His film never lets up on movie atmospherics, and at times, it is truly terrifying. But with that said, the movie does get a little too hokey at times, and the characters aren't all that compelling aside from Lin Shaye as the psychic. But if you want to see a horror film that offers something different, check out \"Insidious\". Whether you laugh the whole time or you're scare straight from it; \"Insidious\" delivers the goods.",

Here, however, I found all the ingredients needed for a  movie to be considered -in my opinion- outstanding. There were indeed, many ghosts, but their presence was used smartly. The only flaw I find is the part of 'comedy' they introduced when the two ghostbusters first appeared in scene. The  initial interactions of those two characters were silly; henceforth, their performances felt fake. In fact, It sort of changed the feeling of the movie, they just didn't fit there. Fortunately, the movie quickly recovered its obscure nature, and went back to its initial pace; this allowed the actors who played the ghostbusters to improve their performances. Still, is precisely that randomness what stops me from giving to this film a score of 10 - but, it is arguably a solid 9. I wish the director didn't make that mistake, so we would have had a formidable movie. Just want to add that to me, the ending was magnificent, however; I acknowledge that as some have already pointed out, it raises a few questions...which I would like to see answered in an Insidious 2 movie. Yet,  I sort of like the fact that the 'happy ending' was not quite there, I mean clear. Overall, this is one of the best horror movies I have watched even though it is not overly scary. Still, I adore it..and I am going to buy the dvd for sure!  What is the secret of this film? It has a clever plot, good performances and the movie as a whole has style! Watch it! Do not let the score or negative comments found here to stop you from doing that! I know if you see this movie you won't regret it!

Then I saw another one that went \"From the creators of Paranormal Activity and Saw\".  Thats my reaction I was like \"This better not have a bunch of random trash happening or uneseccary things happening\". That quickly changed I watched it thinking \"This was creepy and scary (even though I was scared but my girlfriend surly was) and I didn't see a drop of blood\" This was a good story. Now this is much better then the so-called American Horror Classic \"Psycho\". This INSIDIOUS should be the number one horror movie. If you think you can handle it watch it.",

The film had some dull scenes and not very creative shots but still introduced an interesting element to ghost films and left me wanting for more.

While the film borrows heavily from other films and resembles films such as Poltergeist (1982) and borrows from films like The Shining, Rosmary's Baby, ,  it holds it's own in many areas.  It does have aspects of the story that seem to be popping up a lot again in recent years, with films like The Babadook, The Orphanage, and Changeling, of Mothers losing their sanity and questioning their own Son.  But aside from these fashionable clich\u00e9s the film is constantly interesting and exciting, with good horror and suspense throughout.  The film is shot well and atmosphere is fantastic, the weakest part of the film is the low budget nature and over-simplicity of the second half, resembling a lower budget version of The Cell, just without the stunning visuals and other-worldly feel.  The biggest issues with the film is the fast that you already know what the enemies look like, there's absolute no shock factor of \"The Further\",  It's just darkness, and a room with rocking horses and puppets.  It's not very scary or interesting.  It doesn't feel particularly other-worldly, and the only interesting part of the whole experience is the 'lost souls' that move when you don't look at them, which has been done so many times before I've lost count.  They still look creepy and offer a few good jump scares, but the atmosphere is lacking.",

The cast, led by Patrick Wilson and Rose Byrne, is also really good. However, where Insidious falters is in the very far-fetched final act.

The scares consist of a long silence and then a CGI ghost or creature appearing (usually the very funny Darth Maul with a 60\u2019s haircut and Freddy Kreuger glove), that is not scary. In some places I jumped but as I have ranted about in many other reviews there is a large difference between a film making you jump and a film being scary.

This isn't unusual when it comes to films that include a \"reveal\"; even Jaws lost a share of its potency once the shark emerged as more than a shadowy underwater menace. For nearly an hour, Insidious is as unsettling a horror movie as I have seen in recent years - taut, atmospheric, creepy, and at times downright scary. Director James Wan keeps the viewer on edge, always expecting the next \"boo!\" moment. Every pixel of the digital print oozes dread. Around the mid-way point, we are provided with explanations and things that were mysterious become more concrete. After that, nothing is quite as intense. The final 45 minutes of Insidious get the job done - that is to say, they resolve the story (at least to the extent that any horror movie wraps things up) - but they are not the equal of what comes before them.",

Although I have to say it was actually a scary film in an unsettling way, which is what the film has going for it. My biggest problem is the characters, they don't bother talking about all of these crazy events that are happening. Even after they find their child's room ripped apart Patrick Wilson's character still doesn't believe what's going on is supernatural. Its a common problem where your absolutely frustrated with what the characters are doing, because their actions aren't realistic and there is also no depth to the characters. I didn't really care for the characters as there wasn't any character building moments, which more horror films need. If I care for the characters, then ultimately I would probably feel more scared and more into it. My other problem was the jump scares weren't scary at all because you could always predict when they were going to happen, it was probably the general idea around the film that made it scary. But the last act of the film made me more engaged with the story because it is a really interesting approach to a haunted house type story. So overall I would recommend it, but some of its really frustrating. I would have liked more depth to the characters, but its definitely above average for the genre.",
