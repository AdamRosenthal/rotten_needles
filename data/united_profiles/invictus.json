Morgan Freeman and Matt Damon were both impeccable as Mandela and Pienaar, respectively. A film that shows that genius behind Mandela's pushing of success in the 1995 Rugby World Cup for South Africa and how he used it to unite a long divided nation, this one serves as a very good history lesson for those who are unfamiliar with the story and serves as great entertainment as well. Overall, Invictus is a very good historical sports film with fantastic performances that really make the film. You can really feel the tension throughout and it all culminates beautifully at the end.

I understand that there was more to the story than the rugby team. But none of that emerged. It was simply mentioned while we watched Matt Damon and company go through the ups and downs of winning and losing games. The strong acting saves Invictus from being a huge and total disappointment.",

But in this film  Freeman is at the top his game in playing nelson mandela a role that he was born to play an order to  honor Mandela. All though i never thought that Eastwood's soccer film is not not over ratted its a crowd pleaser. the fact that it is based on a true story its touching ,epic , powerful. the acting is good , the cast is good whats not to like.
