This adaptation keeps the events happening with a modern pace with lovely locations and beautiful cinematography that add to the richness of the story. It's undeniably a romantic period chick flick, but one that director Thomas Vinterberg creates with muted passion and rich storytelling skills.",

That sums it up nicely. Though there are technically more men in the lead roles, Bathshuba Everdeen Mall cop effectively overshadows the rest from the get go.

The only thing holding this one back from being better is that it feels a touch drawn out at two hours. Though not necessarily slow, the pay-off and ultimate conclusion do seem obvious, but gets pushed back further and further. It could be shorter and get to the point quicker. However, as it stands, Far from the Madding Crowd is a ravishingly gorgeous film with fantastic cinematography, production design, and costume design. Additionally, Carey Mulligan is phenomenal in the lead role and her male counterparts certainly match her performance, especially Matthias Schoenarts. Far from the Madding Crowd is everything I want from a British period piece, even if it is not the best one ever made thanks to the great direction from Thomas Vinterberg.

      "text": "Engrossing update of Thomas Hardy\u2019s classic book, this pared down version by director Thomas Vinterberg is nearly three quarters of an hour shorter than Schlesinger\u2019s flawed epic made in 1967. Comparisons to the earlier film are inevitable, but the good news is that there is room for both. The 1967 version spent much time evoking period and place, whereas here for much of the time Vinterberg keeps his camera in close on the people creating a more intimate and, it could be argued, less ambitious film. Gone are the longeurs of the previous version. This screenplay adaptation is lean and economical in the telling, propelling what is essentially a very good story forward with the minimum of fuss, but to maximum effect. The acting in both films is very good. Carey Mulligan aces Julie Christie\u2019s more flirtatious and frivolous Bathsheba by playing the part in a more level headed manner. However, when her head is turned by the unsuitable young soldier her subsequent actions seem be more in keeping with Christie\u2019s playing of the character than Mulligan\u2019s. Of the men there is not much to choose between Peter Finch and Michael Sheen, respectively as farmer Boldwood, the desperate and obsessed middle aged neighbour and suitor. Likewise Terence Stamp and Tom Sturridge as the aforementioned soldier Troy, who finally weds Bathsheba whilst being the least suitable suitor for her. Only Mathias Schoenaerts as the shepherd Gabriel doesn\u2019t bear comparison to the earlier incarnation of the character then played by Alan Bates. Whilst looking every inch the part Schoenaerts comes over as one dimensional, strangely lacking any of the screen charisma that he has brought in abundance to his foreign language roles.",
