I ended up going anyways with a friend, and I must say- I take back all former remarks about this new Annie movie, as it was phenomenal.

Unfortunately, the movie stinks. Cameron Diaz. Why is that blonde bimbo in this movie, anyway? She did her worse in Sex Tape, now this. In the original, Hannigan is one of the greatest villains of all time where she was a drunken caretaker and punish many orphanage girls like doing chores, scrubbing the bathroom, and allowing her butler, Rooster, to kill Annie. Dude, Carol Burnett was in the original. A true legendary classic. This is what musical movies is all about. But this Hannigan by Diaz, just complete rubbish. If any movie that should be in the worst movies of 2014 is Annie. Don't even bother seeing it this Christmas because once the Razzies coming up, Worst Remake, Prequel, Reboot, or Sequel, Worst Actress (Diaz), Worst Director, and Worst Picture should do the trick.",

They were not overdone, but the sounds and transitions were updated to sound modern. The new Annie is even cuter than the first and Jamie does an outstanding job playing cold and jaded businessman.

This new variation is so reworked by Hollywood hacks that it bears little resemblance to the original (it's even been moved to present day NYC). The handful of songs that remain are supplemented with some new updated ones and they're all overproduced and flat. Quvenzhan\u00e9 Wallis in the title role is cute. The other leads (Jamie Foxx and Cameron Diaz) are woefully unfunny and the staging is uninventive. Overall, the film has energy but no heart or charm. For a cast that features black actors in the leads, this is sadly soulless.",

At the last minute I tought the dog was going to sing to be honest. The presence of stars like Cameron Diaz, Rihanna and Sia (with awkward cameos) brings some points to watch this film. But when you make a movie you need to show that, a movie, not a musical even thought it was based on the original musical, the central theme of the story disappears when you are watching it and being interrupted by a random moment when a starring role is singing. I admit that the soundtrack is good and renovated, but the soundtrack it's the soundtrack, you can't put the whole thing in a movie and lose the story that way.
