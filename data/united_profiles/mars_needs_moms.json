The problem is that it actually works against the film in two very bad ways. The first is simple: The film is unpleasant to look at. This is uncanny valley territory. Everything looks so real, but at the same time clearly false, that it gets very, very creepy. I think this is the main factor in driving kids away. If I were five years old, this would have freaked me out. The other reason is a point I've been trying to get at for a while. Making animated films look realistic is inherently a bad idea. Leaving the uncanny factor out, this is always a bad idea. Why is it that animated films are made? So we can do things that can't be done in real life. Look to the film with the best 3D animation I've ever seen: Tangled. Tangled's animation was detailed down to the shiniest fiber of hair. Even then, it never looked like anyone was really there. If no one will believe it, then do whatever you can with it. Mars Needs Moms, you fail.",

      "text": "No broccoli, no TV. That's the edict handed down from a mother to her son, so the motion capture boy tries to fool his motion capture mom by feeding the offending vegetable to the motion capture cat. The ruse works, until the cat barfs, and Milo(Seth Green) is sent to bed without his zombie fix. Feeling burned, Milo wishes that he never had a mom, making the woman who sounds suspiciously like Joan Cusack cry, and before he can take it back, she becomes the victim of an alien abduction, in a style that strongly recalls \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\". In the 1977 Steven Spielberg film, the moviegoer feels the anguish of being left behind as Melinda Dillon watches the otherworldly aircraft whisk her baby away beyond the lit-up sky to heaven knows where. \"Mars Needs Moms\" is not quite so harsh(if it was, you'd have a theater full of traumatized little kids), since Milo sneaks on board the departing spaceship. True, Milo's mother may be lobotomized by a faintly Asian-sounding alien who looks a little like E.T.(MIndy Sterling), but \"Mars Needs Moms\" makes sure that the boy has some fun on this dystopian planet, where girls are more prized than boys. With mother and son always being relatively close together, there's not much in the way of drama, as it would've had Milo needed to find his own passage to the red planet. The boy never realizes the full extent of regret for uttering those hurtful words against his mom because he's too cognizant of her whereabouts. The mission, as a result, doesn't have a whole lot of urgency to it, and yet, we do see what could happen to the captured woman(through another character's mother) which is considerably more frightening than anything in \"Bambi\".",

I would say it is up their with Avatar.  I could not take my eyes off the screen!!! The story was well thought out and made me compelled to see more. My daughter loved the aliens, and the character Key was very deep for a children s movie. Before reading the bad reviews and not giving this a watch, just give it a try! You will not be dissapointed!!!",

      "text": "No broccoli, no TV. That's the edict handed down from a mother to her son, so the motion capture boy tries to fool his motion capture mom by feeding the offending vegetable to the motion capture cat. The ruse works, until the cat barfs, and Milo(Seth Green) is sent to bed without his zombie fix. Feeling burned, Milo wishes that he never had a mom, making the woman who sounds suspiciously like Joan Cusack cry, and before he can take it back, she becomes the victim of an alien abduction, in a style that strongly recalls \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\". In the 1977 Steven Spielberg film, the moviegoer feels the anguish of being left behind as Melinda Dillon watches the otherworldly aircraft whisk her baby away beyond the lit-up sky to heaven knows where. \"Mars Needs Moms\" is not quite so harsh(if it was, you'd have a theater full of traumatized little kids), since Milo sneaks on board the departing spaceship. True, Milo's mother may be lobotomized by a faintly Asian-sounding alien who looks a little like E.T.(MIndy Sterling), but \"Mars Needs Moms\" makes sure that the boy has some fun on this dystopian planet, where girls are more prized than boys. With mother and son always being relatively close together, there's not much in the way of drama, as it would've had Milo needed to find his own passage to the red planet. The boy never realizes the full extent of regret for uttering those hurtful words against his mom because he's too cognizant of her whereabouts. The mission, as a result, doesn't have a whole lot of urgency to it, and yet, we do see what could happen to the captured woman(through another character's mother) which is considerably more frightening than anything in \"Bambi\".",
