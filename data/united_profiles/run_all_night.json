Their sons have an inadvertent encounter that leaves one of them dead, which means Neeson has to bring out his gun to protect his son (Joel Kinnaman). If this sounds familiar, it is. Although it's moderately interesting to watch how they evade and defeat the bad guys, there's almost nothing original here. To make matters even more mediocre, the chases and fights are downright dull. The three lead actors bring a certain gravitas to the proceedings. Still, this is one of many quickly forgettable revenge/action films.",

The movie has a fairly strong cast composed of Neeson, Ed Harris, Joel Kinnaman and several other strong actors in the supporting cast like Vincent D'Onofrio and Common. Run All Night is a action film that is as classic as they come. Neeson is a character you generally care about and he is vulnerable at points in the movie where in the last installments in the Taken series it seemed as if he was invincible. Ed Harris also has a strong performance in the film and its nice to see him as the evil one as it seems like he is normally a good guy in most cases. However, one of may problems with the film is that there are two many important players in the film. You get the  Mafia, the police, and an assassin all at once and although that's pretty cool there are points where it seems like it too much. Still its well worth checking out and its a rare March theatre gem. If you are a fan of action movies this movie is a safe bet.",
