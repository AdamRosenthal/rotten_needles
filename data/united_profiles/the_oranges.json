Sure the premise is a little disconcerting at first, but I was really won over by the genuine nature of the central relationship, and the lack of understanding from the rest of the cast felt immensely real. Every time I felt myself becoming frustrated with a character I was able to step back and see the real genuine places they were coming from. Phenomenal writing, passable direction, A+ cast, and while the music made things a little corny here and there I feel sure in saying this is my one of my top movies to come out this year. More people should watch this film!",

I was almost rooting for this film to take off, but it just sat there and got a little boring. Leighton Meester was just unlikeable enough, Hugh Laurie was just passive enough, and Oliver Platt lacked the razor-sharp wit that writers from his other films and tv shows typically supply him with. And the Catherine Keener role??  The goats?  I wish they had taken another run at her story.",
