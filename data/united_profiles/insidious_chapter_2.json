I feel like they made things up mid story just to make the story tie in and work. The acting on Rose Byrne's part was good, and for a lot of the part I thought Patrick Wilson was decent as a possessed guy... until the end it got kind of cheesy. I've seen this film twice now, and the first time I thought it was scary, the second time not so much, which just goes to show that a lot of the scares are because of the unexpected, rather than because of the unknown and wonder. The horror flicks that mess with your mind are the best kinds, like the Blair Witch Project, Paranormal Activity, etc. This was watchable, for a horror sequel it actually wasn't bad... the music volume has GOT to be lowered though.

It seems that all horror comes down to nowadays  is around 2 scares out of it. Nothing felt original in this movie and more or less felt like a remake with scares from the first one. Even the order of events were the same, \"scares\", arguments, \"more scares\", arguments, get professionals, more and more \"scares\", into dream, and more \"scares\", end. And these scares we've seen way too many times in horror movies and it's time to grow up and think of something new. People around me and my friends were jumping out of their seats and I'm sitting leaning on my hand like \"Really?\" If you scare easily and are a novice to horror movies, I guess you'll get the experience more than I did. But if you're not scared from dark corners and jump scares, which was basically what this movie was like, then I suggest giving it a miss. People will disagree and say the build up in music tenses you. Sure for the first time it happened, not for the 10th time in a row. This feature felt as though it was getting shoved down my throat and I'm getting bored of it. This movie did have a few chuckle moments in it even though they were quite funny. I was honestly hoping it to be a good scare and not be able to sleep last night, but I slept absolutely no bother. Also, at the beginning it shows Elise when she was younger and they dubbed her voice in with the actress that plays her. It was a really lame part of the movie in my opinion. Although, the good things I can say about the movie was that the ending was good and the acting was very believing.",

All of the thrill and scares that the movie tries to bring in come from cheap scares that come from overly loud sounds and somewhat disturbing visuals. The plot makes no sense; even after seeing the first one when it came out, I was left wondering what I was watching. The characters are flat; it's almost as if the director and writer didn't even try to come up with something original. The climax to the film is a weird mixture between The Sixth Sense and The Shining that left me bored and slightly shocked that someone could be so unoriginal. Patrick Wilson plays the only redeemable character in the film, but James Wan's directing is so bad, that Mr. Wilson comes off as a second rate Jack Nicholson from The Shining... only without everything that made The Shining so good.",

James Wan is fantastic at building suspense and using it at the right times to scare the audience. The performances are great in the film as well, especially from Patrick Wilson . His performance in certain parts of the movie reminded me of Jack Nicholson in The Shining. Rose Byrne was also pretty decent but this was Patrick Wilson's movie.

      "text": "I should start by saying that I was not the hugest fan of Insidious to begin with although I did find it better than average and decent, just not great. The sequel however is the epitome of why most sequels do not work, Insidious 2 is just a mess. First strike is that this movie cannot stand on its own, viewing of the first Insidious is absolutely required if you are to understand the plot or care about any of the characters. Insidious 2 starts where the first left off only the characters are not familiar in the sense that this franchise is beloved or well known so that when we start here, even if you have seen the first, you just do not care about anyone in this film...child, women or otherwise. I think the creator is banking on fanboy success in that you are already familiar with all of the characters and thus interested in their progression. Even then, the characters here are wire thin as far as development goes...I will say that the actors portraying the young versions of the primary cast in flashback scenes were marvellous. It is obvious there is a lot of love here, as far as the making of, but it is too much to ask of the audience to be equally enthusiastic about this franchise as the creators are.",

I enjoyed The Conjuring and its sequel, Annabelle, but missed the first installment of the Insidious series. I decided to take the leap and just watch Chapter 2 with no prior engagement, and I sorely wish I hadn't. After blithely sitting through the first 45 minutes, I began to nod off. By the end of the movie I was more bored than I have been watching a movie in years. Films like this give the horror genre not just a bad name, but are an absolute mockery of everything good horror should be. A tragic, tragic failing.",
