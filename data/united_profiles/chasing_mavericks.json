Fully knowing that this one would not be a potential Oscar contender in a any category what-so-ever, and that the family-friendly film would likely have a routine, formulaic dramatic arc to it, with few (if any) surprises, didn't matter at all. If its got gigantic, ocean waves in it, with pro surfers taking them on like bareback bronco riders in a wild west show, The Hawk would be there. This true story of a young 16 yr-old surfing prodigy and his courage to face one of the largest waves ever recorded on film was a thrillingly inspirational experience. However,...if you're looking for a flick that fits the definition of film as art that will remain in your mind for years to come for its originality and creativity,... one will need to look elsewhere.",
