A unique take on the whole Westboro Baptist Church nonsense, except if they were heavily armed domestic terrorists, Red State is a compelling film. There are certainly moments of pure terror to be found here and it is most certainly well-directed by Smith in that regard. However, he abandons all of these into a sea of bullets and ends it in truly anti-climactic fashion. These are both major negatives, but this really combine with the bad acting from most of our young leads (the older folks do pretty well, especially John Goodman). The comedic aspects here are oddly placed and while some do hit, most are just truly awkward and miss the mark. Incredibly inspired by the 70's/80's teenage slasher flicks before it, Red State is classic Kevin Smith fare, especially in the fact that something about it feels oddly unsatisfying.",

Smith not only directed and wrote this film, but he also produced it independently, keeping it out of theaters, but how come? The answer is simple, it's Smith's unique personality and ability to show a film in a context that is as real as possible. Red State is a fictional type story that resembles and mocks the events in Waco. Three High School kids, from a small town, decide to use the internet to find a prostitute. They think they found a bargain, but when they arrived they quickly discovered that all their lives are now in danger. The woman who placed the add, belongs to a religious cult, who owns a compound, where they execute sinners. Michael Parks plays the leader of this group, Abin Copper, and in ever sense of the word he is nothing but brillient! As the pastor with two personalities, a public and private persona, Parks is able to really give us an inside look at what is really going on inside the minds of these people, it really was a great performance. The other standout from this cast is John Goodman, who plays the lead FBI agent in charge, who has to battle his conscious at the same time he's battling Cooper. Red State is a dark and extremely graphic depiction of what life is like in an ultra religious, super conservative environment. Some of the graphic speeches and violence can be hard to watch, but the acting is off the charts good, and you can't ask for a more creative or innovative writer than Kevin Smith. As usual, this film isn't for everyone, but I really loved it.",

Kevin Smith moves away from comedy in a daring and frighteningly realistic social commentary that serves as a vehement strike against the current domestic policy in America. With the events following 9/11 and the Westboro Baptist Church fresh in mind, Smith not only attacks the fanaticism of mindless religious zealots, but also the media's role in perpetuating their actions and our government's questionable response to domestic terrorism that is taken under martial law. Michael Parks plays the part of the Reverend Abin Cooper with all of the charm and charisma of a narcissistic psychopath and cult leader, making it easy to see how his simpleminded followers could easily be drawn to violence \"in the name of the Lord.\" John Goodman is in fine form as well as Joseph Keenan, the leader of the military task force that descends upon Cooper's secluded farmhouse. He stands as the voice of reason against an uncaring government bureaucracy that is only concerned with eliminating the social threat with no care towards collateral damage. The rough filming and raw violence create a sense of ultra-realism on screen, while Smith's cynical sense of humor comes through brilliantly in the script (particularly in Keenan's final debriefing).
