I got to admit that I had  little more faith going into this one given that more characters were going to be introduced, a whole group of pirate animals to be exact. This could have opened this Ice Age into fresher territory with more character development, but the truth is that no pirate really develops. One opportunity for example relies on the fact that the two saber tigers, Diego and the girl, were falling in love, but any tease of what the animals may be feeling is left just like that, a tease. They end up together but is hard to tell in what disposition because there relationship is developed in a matter of roughly 5 minutes. So what does Continental Drift means? It means more of the same. A new entry that once again relies on the like-able trio of Mammoth, tiger, and sloth, and off course the lonely squirrel.

There are potential plot lines for the movie such as Sid dealing with his family or Manny dealing with his daughter Peaches and her having to fit in. However, these plot lines are either ignored or poorly written providing a lot of stuff that has been done before. There are new characters but none of them are likeable or interesting. Plus, the film tries to be hip with teenage mammoths who have crazy hairstyles and has a bad musical number. All of these elements come together to form a meh film that is the worst of the franchise. Unless you are a little kid or a fan of the films, then this is a definite skip.",

I didn\u2019t enjoy this one as much as the other \u2018Ice Age\u2019 films, probably because it has lost all the charm the characters had in the earlier films. On the plus side, Peter Dinklage did make for a very intimidating and threatening advocacy.

It tells a familiar story with familiar life lessons that have been tossed into tons of other kids movies.

There are celebrities that play the roll of animal teenagers with actual expressions. The bad guys are boring, not interesting at all an they are just an excuse of a villain. Scrat turned into a very cartoony character, it isnt funny any more and when he gets to \"Scratlantis\" he just gets nuts for nuts. Sids granny isnt funny either, shes just too annoying. Diego an Shiras relationship is also boring, the only thing i see there is a relationship between Denis Larry and Jenifer Lopez. Also the script is the worst one. Ice Age 4 is a shame compared with the beloved 1st one and its sequel.",
