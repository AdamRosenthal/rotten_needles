This sends another fugitive (Robert Redford) on the run, while a plucky journalist (Shai LaBeouf) tracks the case. This is not a taught chase, but a thoughtful pursuit. It's interesting to watch the solution comes together, but could have been a tighter. The cast is full of accomplished actors (Julie Chistie, Nick Nolte,) who all do a good job. While political messages creep in too often, the pursuit of the man and the truth makes for an absorbing journey.",

Of the performances Shia Lebouf comes off best as a young reporter who unmasks the identity of a suspected killer involved in a politically motivated incident that took place some 30 years before. Story wise the film reminds one of Sidney Lumet's 1988 film 'Running on Empty', but it in no way emulates that film's quality. Both Redford ann Julie Christie have been seen to better advantage.",
