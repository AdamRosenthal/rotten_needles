This is definitely one of those movies you instantly see and know it could have been better if not for its restrictions with its pg-13 rating. In the obnoxious current vampire craze, this takes a different direction and its welcomed in my opinion. Being based on a graphic novel helps, no twilight influences here. The beginning doesn't drag on, it spends just enough time on the character development and gets going. Parts are cheesy and some dialogue is corny, but the most part, it's worth seeing. I didn't care for the way it ended, its not terrible, but it could have been done a lot better. If your on edge, probably see it in a budget theater or rent it, you won't be missing too much.",

      "text": "All is not quiet at the Catholic Holy Cross Cemetery. Somebody get a priest. On second thought, don't. That's what has John Ford rolling in his grave to begin with. It's the breach in the fine line between homage and ripoff. The sacreligiousity at work here is two-fold. The filmmaker manages to upset both Christians and cineastes in equal proportions. The \"Legion\" director, whose funny idea of the holy spirit in his 2009 debut was that God would send down a battalion of homicidal angels to zombify the masses with an ecclesiastical opiate, has moved on from ripping off a B-movie classic like George Romero's \"Night of the Living Dead\". Now, in his not-so-infinite wisdom, he's raiding the film canon for ideas. In \"Priest\", the filmmakers takes \"The Searchers\" template and replaces the cowboys and Indians with clergymen and vampires, then sets their ongoing hostilities toward each other in a dystopian world where the Catholic church functions as a totalitarian regime. The all-powerful monsignors, a group of theological autocrats, who preside over the God-fearing masses in these walled-up cities, use Orwellian-like methods of mind control to neutralize the priests, whom the church disbanded after the vampire menace was deemed to be over. Taking a cue from Sam Peckinpah's \"Ride the High Country\", the priest(Paul Bettany), no longer a useful member of society(the marginalized vampires are tucked away on reservations), is reduced to shoveling coal for a living, a humiliating job, similar to the cowboy Westrum in the 1962 film, who runs a rigged carnival game out of desperation. (Alas, Peckinpah was cremated and had his ashes scattered at sea.) Unlike Ethan Edwards(John Wayne), the priest never returns home to be among the kinfolk. That's probably because he still covets his brother's wife, Shannon. The child they bore together prior to his leaving for the clergy is a dead giveaway; the child whom Hicks and the priest with no name are now searching for. Fate. You can't run away from it. By roaming the city all those years like a vagabond, the priest avoids the sexual tension that Ethan faces when he finally succumbs to love and returns home to see Martha Edwards, still married to his brother Aaron. In the film's iconic first shot, when Martha opens the door, framing the outback in its opening, you notice her hands, first the left, then the right, gripping the house itself to steady herself as she makes her way outside. In that instant, she's not a mother and wife; she's a woman in love, struggling to remember her vows. While Ethan approaches the homestead, Martha does something very subtle with her hand that hints at the desire which belies her blue dress and white apron get-up. Before she straightens her fingers to block out the glare of the sun, they're arranged at the forehead in such a way that suggests she's about to faint. It's not the heat; this conservative frontier woman is swooning. When Ethan chastely kisses her forehead, she closes her eyes. Meanwhile, the Confederate Army hero isn't thinking straight either. The cowboy mistakes Debbie for Lucy, despite the girls being at least ten years apart in age. That's anguish. He wants to turn back the years. Because of \"Priest\", with its similar but different relationship dynamic between Ethan/Priest and Martha/Shannon, perhaps, a shared sexual past, and not unrequited love, is the correct interpretation for Ethan's stolen glances and the way Martha gently smooths her brother-in-law's military coat. Maybe, just maybe, the identically named Lucy is Ethan's daughter. Now the scene where Ethan and Martha's hands briefly touch as they both reach for a lantern becomes more ambiguous. Aaron, who is storing money away while this display of subtle intimacy takes place, rather than being oblivious to his wife's slight marital indiscretion, may possibly know, and accepts their muted flirtation, but chooses to look the other way. In \"Priest\", Owen knows that the child isn't his. Evidence of a sexual past can be gleaned from the scene in which Ethan stabs the soil(vagina) with his knife(penis), a metaphorical remembrance, perhaps, of the night he and Martha conceived Lucy, whose denuded lifeless body the war hero discovers in the cave. \"Don't ever ask me MORE,\" Ethan tells Brad, later on, when Lucy's boyfriend mistakes a squaw for his betrothed. \"More\", filtered through \"Priest\", suddenly becomes a loaded word. Whereas Ethan's love for Martha outweighs his hatred for the Indians as the determining deterrent against killing Debbie, a converted Comanche, in \"Priest\", Hicks(the stand-in for Martin), Lucy's protector, probably knows that vampire infection isn't the sole reason for the potentiality of the father committing fratricide. He broke his vow of celibacy. The timeline is a mere technicality. Now he must atone, murderously. Does the priest love God more than his daughter? Thankfully, no.",

Karl Urban plays the villain and I have to say he did an absolute horrible job. His acting was terrible, I don't know if it was the writing or what but he was bad, his lines were so dumb.

      "text": "\"Priest\" is exactly what you'd expect it to be - a blood-infested, action-packed, testosterone-charged action fest. That does not necessarily mean it's bad, it's just typical. It follows a rather linear story, with bad dialogue (very machoist, many a times) and some bad visual effects. For a change, however, it does show vampires as not the over-sexualised, highly intelligent beings, but as brute alien like monsters, which was somewhat refreshing. The film is also surprisingly short with only 1 hour and 20 minutes - definitely could have been longer. Well, if it had been better, it could have been longer. The way it is now, though, 1:20 is perfectly fine. I don't even know what to say. Yes, it's entertaining, but it won't leave you with wanting any more than what you've been given. The ending does provide for a perfect (intentionally so) setup for a sequel, that due to horrible reviews and box office will never be made. The films biggest flaw is its poor screenplay, but that might be a fault of the original comic book too, which I have never read before. In general, the film was overly predictable and not very exciting, though reasonably entertaining. Going into it you won't find anything that you haven't seen in films like this before, but you won't be completely disappointed either. If you are looking for what I've described in the first sentence, you'll definitely get that. If you are looking for some genre changer, you will be severely disappointed.",

A skinny little white guy with a cross  on his face is going to save the world from a vampire threat? Ewwww not going to fly. Plus, lets also add in that his fight seens really weren't to immaculate. Yes, he did kill vampires in various ways which was pretty cool, but then at the end when he had to fight the main bad guy he just got **** up. He really got **** up. Now im aware that he is only a vampire killer and he should only do well against vampires, that in and of itself destroys the badass thing that the movie was going for. Yeah he's pretty cool fighting **** that he knows how to kill and that he can kill easily, but when it comes something a little bit stronger he just gets destroyed. There was no improv from his part he justs get beaten up and then saved by the girl priest. Not very badass......at all. So the writing for the main character could have been much better and then they definately needed a new actor, I'd say vin diesel, or \"The Rock\" or maybe Jason Statham or someone along those lines.",

Story-line beats special effects, in my opinion, and of course above all, a decent acting performance, even though I don't have much to complain about Paul Bettany, except the fact that he chooses his movies a little unwisely.",

      "text": "I think the most shocking thing about this film is that I didn't hate it. I actually quite enjoyed it despite the fact its obviously lacking in the same power as other graphic novel adaptations (Sin City). Priest doesn't try to push itself beyond the boundaries of its source material and that is why it works. It stays true to the world created in the novel while adding its own qualities, such as some of the beautiful landscapes. The film embraces western conventions such as costumes, locations and mannerisms giving this action film more to it than just a run, slice and kill experience. However the fact it has to embrace multiple genres also holds the film back with equal time being spent indulging in Blade Runner-esque dystopia which seems to overpower the film. If only there were subtle references to the futuristic aspect of the world but the film unfortunately spends a decent chunk of the beginning in the dark and dreary cityscapes instead of where the film belongs. The film is overburdened by the multiple genres but still manages to entertain. It even provides a new take on the vampire which I found very welcome, not because of Twilight or True Bloods over sexualized take on them but because it showed them as monsters, not redeemable creatures, not things that possess emotion but feral beasts, ready to rip you apart. I won't spend much time critiquing acting because this is not the kind of film where stellar work is required. The actors get the story from A to B just fine and Maggie Q even manages to tap into a well of emotion in comparison to Bettany's sullen portrayal of Priest (sometimes not giving a character a name is clever but in this case it just seems lazy). A fun little film packed with great landscapes and some terrifying monsters (No Karl Urban, you do not count) that entertains if only because it doesn't try to be fine art.",

The CGI could have been from the '90s, the slow-motion is irritating, and the 3D effects are obtrusive and gratuitous. The story is practically 'good guy fights bad guy' - then it ends. The acting, particularly from Gigandet, is laughably wooden. In fact, no one seems committed to their role, but it's not hard to see why; the make-up effects consist of a painted cross on the head -- everything else is CGI. When the actors are given NOTHING to work with, then it becomes difficult to put together a meaningful performance. It's interesting to note the amount of times the word 'priest' and its plural are said; often characters will just yell it out for no reason, making for what would be an interesting drinking game. That's just it, though; with all of its amateurishness, you could have a lot of fun with this movie in the right mood; it's lame, it's stupid, and it's most certainly terrible; but it's a hell of a way to kill 80 minutes.",
