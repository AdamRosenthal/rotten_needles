Actors Teller and Simmons, who played the roles of Andrew and Fletcher respectively, have shown quality performances as their strong jazz chemistry really left an impression; Simmons's oscar-winning performance as Fletcher is straight out deserved, as he performs his role with utter power and absolute dominance. The plot is packed with tension and drama as the pace consistently gains momentum until it all explodes with a refreshing bang at the movie's satisfying grand final act.

Written and directed by Damien Chazille, this is a film that will appeal to lovers of jazz as it represents some of the best musical renditions ever seen on the movie screen. It is also a film that raises the question as to how far a teacher should go to \"bring out the best\" in his or her student. Messrs. Simmons and Teller are superb in the roles they play as they participate in some of the most intense student/teacher scenes one will ever see. Adding to their credibilty, we find out that in real life Mr. Teller studied drums from age 15 and Mr. Simmons holds degrees in voice, conducting and music from the University of Montana. As a result it\u2019s easy to understand the believability of their respective performances. Having myself played in studio bands under the stewardship of a number of quality professors, the film had a special meaning for me. But, alas, this is what may make this really good film a commercial mishap since it is not for everyone and, by its very subject matter, may exclude a significant part of the viewing public. I give the film a 9.0 because, seen out of context and apart from other films, it stands out as a true work of art. The caveat here, though, is that if intense musicology, training and signficant jazz performances are not the viewer\u2019s \"thing\", then this film will not be appreciated by him or her to the same extent as it was by me.",

      "text": "Wow. That was so intense, yet so simplistic. Whiplash follows the story of a drum player played by Miles Teller. He's extremely relatable as he wants this as his career, and is working so hard to get there; a situation we've all been in. We also see that he is not handling the pressure that well. He's in debt, he's barely paying the rent and is verging insanity. From this we want him to succeed, as we see that he is a good guy, but his incredibly bad luck is just bringing him down; again another situation we've all been in. The humanisation of this character is so engaging that even if there was no plot or dialogue at all in the movie, it would still keep audiences in their seats. But that's not the case. The plot presented before us may be simple, but it's execution is stellar in every possible respect - from acting to cinematography to music; it simply is a masterpiece. The story comes into play when our main character is at the end of his rope and is a mer millimetre away from giving up. However, he gains hope again when he has the opportunity to study in a class taught by this legendary music teacher played by J.J Simons. He gets in, but gets way more than he bargains for. Simons teaching methods are extremely cruel and some what sadistic, using physical, verbal and psychological torture to motivate his students. In addition to this, Simons's performance is absolutely and utterly impeccable. At every given moment some sort of malice is shown by him, making you actually fear what he might put Teller through next. It's easily the best performance of the year and Simons definitely needs to win an oscar. The film also makes you continuously have conflicting opinions on this character. For example, Simons will often say utterly evil yet hilarious things, that makes you question your own morality by finding it funny. But the best thing about this character is how real he really is. We've all had some sort of intelligent, charismatic yet malevolent boss or teacher that we've hated with every morsel of our beings. However, the greatest part of this film is at the end. After around a month of all of this, Simons deems Teller ready to preform, but also warns him that if he messes this up, he will suffer beyond anything he's ever felt. Mix that with excellent camera work and thematic music, and you have one of the most tension filled scenes in the whole of film history. It takes you through the scene at such a methodical, slow pace that just builds an extreme level of suspense. Without a doubt Whiplash is one of the best, if not the best film of 2014.",

Moreover how did he get a job as the conductor of a pro band despite the fact that he's been accused of emotionally torturing a boy to the point where he committed suicide? Shouldn't Fletcher be in jail? How is he walking free. Moreover some of his actions don't even make sense. He expels a student from the band who is in tune because he didn't know whether he was off tune but doesn't even take action against the one who's out of tune, even though he's completely oblivious to that fact as well? I'm sorry is it just me or is that a contradiction. Car accidents don't seem to bother our protagonist too much. That's the least of his problems. He just couldn't afford any scars at that time so he didn't get any. \"There's no to words more harmful than Good Job\"? Really? That's not dark, that's not bleak, that's just stupid and simplistic. Whiplash is a film about the pain that accompanies passion, and the blood that's shed on the road to perfection. But sadly, it doesn't execute well. The movie has some tense scenes but the overall result is contrived and unsatisfying. It has a few twists but ultimately it's the same conventional story about the tough love shared by the arrogant apprentice and the abusive master.",

Further imagine a teacher who uses your deepest and darkest secrets such as the abandonment from your own mother to repeatedly scream at you \"That she left you and your father because you are worthless pieces of s**t\". Chazelle seriously subjects the audience to his belief that this deeply scarring rage and abuse is required to create a great musician.

Very superficial though and get bored when you watch a movie that does exactly what thousands of movies have done before, don't bother watching. One point to Simmons and one point to the music though.",

So, worth seeing for all this. The plot itself is extremely unrealistic, however.

I was in the mood for a test-your-dream story set in the music world, and Whiplash delivered. The basic story arc of an ambitious musician finding what he's made of in the New York performing arts world is delivered in workmanlike fashion. Ultimately, however, I did not fear Simmons as the instructor, and thought too much of his dialogue was re-worked from the drill instructor in \"Full Metal Jacket.\" Here, I may have been the victim of high expectations, given the Academy Awards. The drumming performances were quite compelling, at least to a non-expert such as myself, and drew me in to the history of jazz, with Buddy Rich and Charlie Parker key icons of the shared values of the main characters. I thought the final act was a little contrived to arrive at a Hollywood climax, resulting in the pacing of the story becoming more uneven. Ultimately, if this movie rates universal acclaim, then \"The Paper Chase\" would as well, and I don't think most critics would put the latter in cinema's top echelon.",

The work with the cameras really helped to create this figure, staying with details and looking up, at him, or down, at the rest. The problems with this film starts when you look around at the other things on screen; the plot is almost nonexistent, leading to a chaos of nonsense; the protagonist is not well defined, making impossible for the viewer to understand his actions and decisions; and the camera's work that was magnificent at the beginning is lost along the way.

There are really only two actors in this film that matter and they are Miles Teller and JK Simmons. Miles Teller is a young man who will be a force to be reckoned with in the years to come (especially with his involvement in the reboot of the Fantastic Four). Teller can act, and he could have been nominated for an Oscar for this role. Teller is a veteran drummer so this story was something that he was certainly passionate about and that passion is apparent throughout the film. I'm glad they didn't stick a rookie behind the kit. JK Simmons, who has already won a Golden Globe for this performance, was so amazing. This guy came out of no where. The biggest role Simmons had was playing J Jonah Jameson in the original Spiderman trilogy and he played him beautifully, but Whiplash will be the film he is remembered for. He is up for an Oscar for this film and I think the odds are likely in his favor considering the competition. I think that anyone can enjoy Whiplash because of its intensity.",

That's really all I have to say on the matter The only reason it isn't a 10/10 is because it did'n't quite have everything I would like in a movie, but it is phenomenal none the less.. If you have a free hour and forty minutes and want to spend it in the best way humanly possible (comfort of your living room wise, this doesn't quite beat doing blow off of the small of Woody Harrelson's back while skydiving, but damn is it close) then this movie is a must see. It's all about a 19 year old (Miles Teller) wanting to be one of the greats at the drums, so he turns to a teacher (J.K. Simmons) with less than orthodox teaching style that does get its results. This movie perfected suspense for me, I was alert the whole time, I could barely take my eyes off the screen each time I've watched it, I was to busy waiting for the next scene to happen. Its been a while since a movie has drawn me in so much, I became invested in the main characters journey and in the acting of J.K. Simmons. Whiplash is all about being pushed beyond what is expected of normal people, to reach the extraordinary results, just from one viewing of this inspirational film even the most useless of procrastinators would get up off their ass to try something. I know I had that feeling. Alright, I've probably said to much already, this is great, go watch it, and that's that. If you watch this and don't agree, we can either settle this with a long winded internet argument, or like men in the streets with bars of soap in soccer socks. Yeah, I'm that serious about this movie. But whats not to like, some good ol' intense acting, a very colorful pallet of swears (this movie is a learning experience in the field of vulgarity, and some incredible music numbers, specifically the drums, it is amazing.",

      "text": "Martin Scorsese used to say something along the lines that \"Raging Bull\" was a great film in spite of being about boxing, which only serves as a \"black box\" to contain the drama and shots.Even though the black box in this film is jazz, mainly it's about ABUSE. WHIPLASH also deserves the category of great and original films, and is really an anachronism, like the jazz age of old, to the world and mainstream films of today. The surrealism here , along with other notables like \"Black Swan\" that also has unconventional montage sequences, underscores the horrible abuse by Fletcher's character; obviously present in the real musical world, but makes it into hyperbole. I've had music teachers and mentors in my life that have been emotionally abusive, although the physical abuse in this film seems a bit far fetched and a bit removed from reality. Needless to say, it's all very bad in that abuse is abuse, and planned public humiliation is abuse. JK Simmons is truly and after this feat, one of the most gifted character actors of our day, and his passive aggressive maniacal performance will be remembered for years to come. Also,the bipolar nature of this character is more TRUE to actual drill sergeants I encountered years ago in the Air Force, in that they did yell and berate you, etc. and try to mess with your mind by giving you compliments or letting you relax right before they chewed you a new one! This is Machiavellian and more psychologically intense than the full on physical assault of Lee Ermey in Full Metal Jacket. There are more nuances here. I'll finalize this by saying to those of you out there who've been humiliated or suffered emotional abuse in the music field, you are not alone. But please also, take a Xanax or Valium and don't chug coffee before the film, or you might find yourself wanting to punch someone before you leave the theater. Yes, the film is THAT INTENSE, adrenaline charged, and deserving of many awards!!!",

Every aspect of this film is geared towards heightening the anxiety levels, from its cinematography, rapid drum playing scenes and teaching methods. There is abuse and pain, suffering and depth. A truly wonderful film that takes viewers on an emotional thrill ride and leaves them with an extremely memorable closing score.",
