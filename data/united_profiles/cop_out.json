All elements clearly and intentionally paid homage (as Tracy Morgan humorously mispronounces at the beginning of the movie).  It was Kevin's not-so-subtle message (along with the cheap synthesizer and Fletch song at the ending fade) that he was about to show a film that had not one ounce of originality, but was meant to be an enjoyable popcorn film for fans of his, fans like him and those who just wanted to be entertained.  I had NO expectations coming into this movie as critics and viewers alike ripped it apart.  From a critical perspective, it's only slightly above average.  However, from the INTENT of the film, it was perfect.  The movie was fun, enjoyable and made me happy to see the genre revisited.  Thanks Kevin!",
