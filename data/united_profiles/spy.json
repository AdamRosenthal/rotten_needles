Mcarthy is brilliant, and Statham displays a hitherto unseen sense of comic timing that was utilised to great effect. A surprising script peppered with every expletive you can think of, and probably some you can't, and some rather visceral violence ensures that Mcarthy will be thought of alongside other famous on-screen spies. The action sequences were excellent and the dialogue was absolutely superb, with so many memorable lines. In the same league as Kingsmen, though not quite as polished, this was a thoroughly enjoyable film. 8.79/10",

It seemed as though the screenwriter opened that spigot in the last quarter of the movie, and those bombs soon felt contrived and utterly gratuitous.

Rose Byrne is great with her constant put downs and a scene with her and McCarthy on a plane is hysterical. Miranda Hart is also terrific even though I initially thought her out of place but once she moved out into the field in the second half of the film I could not take my eyes off her and found that she stole scenes with great one liners or even just funny mannerisms. Jason Statham was perhaps not as funny as I was expecting but he was still great delivering his lines in a comically dead pan voice.The most plaudits must however go to Paul Feig for managing to create a film that was hilarious yet also riveting through its many plot twists and action sequences. His writing was so brilliantly specific to each character, something that only heightened the comedy.

Thanks heaven SPY has arrived, a third collaboration with Paul Feig, and unites her with the criminally under-appreciated her BRIDESMAIDS (2011) co-star Rose Byrne, and under Feig\u2019s helm, together they concoct up a thoroughly hilarious spin-off of James Bond\u2019s spy trademark, with an overhaul of a female lead and in passing, finally fulfils Jude Law\u2019s yearning as a suited-up top agent after he lost the battle to Daniel Craig almost 10 years ago, and gives Jason Statham a rare opportunity to tease his own action hero stereotype.",

There hasn't been a comedy this good and this consistently funny since maybe The Lego Movie, but I would argue that Spy is even better than that. Spy is about a CIA analyst, played by Melissa McCarthy, who has to go undercover after her partner falls off the grid to prevent a global disaster. I love Melissa McCarthy, but this is by far her best role I've seen her in. She's an extremely versatile actress, who can make pretty much every type of joke a hit. They're all perfectly timed and delivered so that, even if the jokes themselves aren't all that funny, the timing and delivery made them so much better than they should have been. The plot itself is a little thin, but there are some good twists towards the end. It almost doesn't matter because of how much you'll be laughing throughout the movie. You definitely won't want to pass this up when it gets into theaters in June. It'll be one of the best times you've had at a theater in a while.",

Smaller cast members; Miranda Hart, Peter Serafinowicz, and Allison Janney all contributed greatly to the movie. Melissa McCarthy has played many roles similar to this one, so if you want to see a different character from her, you will have to wait for her next film. McCarthy still delivers when she turns into filthy-mouthed intelligent badass after she has to become a spy for the CIA, because the entire group of spies have been discovered by the extremely ignorant villain, played by the beautiful Rose Byrne. McCarthy has to save the world from a nuclear bomb, and along the way she keeps you laughing and wondering what might come out of her mouth next, and of course if she will succeed in finding the bomb.",
