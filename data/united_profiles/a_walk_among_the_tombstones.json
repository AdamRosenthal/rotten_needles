Since Taken he has been involved in several action films like the A-team, Non-Stop and now two sequels to Taken. This role displays his serious side where he portrays a deep character that doesn't have to kill everyone he comes in to contact with in order to entertain the audience. These are the movies that Neeson should be doing now that he is well over 60 years old. Brian Astro Bradley also showed off some acting chops as Neesons young \"associate\". Astro made a name for himself being a contestant on the X factor but it looks like he may have a promising career in acting. A Walk Among the Tombstones is a great crime film. It really doesn't make you think too hard but it still has some shock value. This movie is certainly one of the underrated 2014 films.",

When Liam's character is asked to track down two demented killers who make drug dealers widowers he steps into more than he bargained for. The cast was well picked and well defined. The plot was not terribly complicated and coupling that with so many different characters and moving pieces sort of mashed it up a bit. There was a lot of weight put on the horrible killers but even to the end it is not all that clear why they did what they did and where they came from in the first place and why it is so important that they be stopped as opposed to other criminals Liam could be being paid to chase. Kind of trivializes things. Overall a cruel bloody tale of bad guys and who ever is not quite bad enough to be a bad guy. Liam Neeson carried dignity and grit as he always does. But I think this movie overextended its relevance in certain scenes, and didn't glaze it with enough action and/or pretty women to make you not notice.
