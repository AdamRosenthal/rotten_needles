The film had some good scenes which broke up the boredom throughout but overall left me wanting more, one of the flaws being that they reveal who is behind the murders around half way through, so it loses all appeal to those wanting a murder mystery movie such as myself.

My biggest issue that makes me like other crime dramas like prisioners more than this is there really isn't any big villain reveal. It might seem like it when their identities are hidden in scenes but  half way in they just are like screw it show who they are, killing the suspense and mystery.

      "text": "I must say I was worried that Liam Neeson was becoming a typecast actor. Since Taken he has been involved in several action films like the A-team, Non-Stop and now two sequels to Taken. This role displays his serious side where he portrays a deep character that doesn't have to kill everyone he comes in to contact with in order to entertain the audience. These are the movies that Neeson should be doing now that he is well over 60 years old. Brian Astro Bradley also showed off some acting chops as Neesons young \"associate\". Astro made a name for himself being a contestant on the X factor but it looks like he may have a promising career in acting. A Walk Among the Tombstones is a great crime film. It really doesn't make you think too hard but it still has some shock value. This movie is certainly one of the underrated 2014 films.",

      "text": "This movie was a bit slow and thriller-like considering Liam Neeson is the main character playing a retired cop now private detective. He is a skilled and occasionally dynamic actor so this did not step out of his abilities. There was less hard nosed punch and shoot action than I expected. When Liam's character is asked to track down two demented killers who make drug dealers widowers he steps into more than he bargained for. The cast was well picked and well defined. The plot was not terribly complicated and coupling that with so many different characters and moving pieces sort of mashed it up a bit. There was a lot of weight put on the horrible killers but even to the end it is not all that clear why they did what they did and where they came from in the first place and why it is so important that they be stopped as opposed to other criminals Liam could be being paid to chase. Kind of trivializes things. Overall a cruel bloody tale of bad guys and who ever is not quite bad enough to be a bad guy. Liam Neeson carried dignity and grit as he always does. But I think this movie overextended its relevance in certain scenes, and didn't glaze it with enough action and/or pretty women to make you not notice. If you're a Liam fan like me, give it a try, if not, maybe worth a watch for free at the most.",

From there I thought the movie could only get better however, I must say TAKEN will be what he stays known for.

This will make a good rental for later , I would not pay a prime movie ticket price for this performance.",
