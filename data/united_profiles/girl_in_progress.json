Those were Stupendous films who's heights few movies can attain, but had Girl In Progress had a little more of the focus and inspiration of the sort that drove two films then it would have gone a long way to convincing me that this was an 8 or a 9 instead of a 6.  There was also some bad jokes of extremely poor taste.  To wit:  \"Your husband beats you\", said to a waitress as though that was a judgement on her character and not on her husband's.  Again, regarding the same waitress, \"She had a fight with a flight of stairs.\"  Ha ha.  These two jokes alone are enough to merit a Zero out of Ten in anybody's book, so it is lucky I am giving it a 6.",
