Everyone else in the film is supposed to be his straight man while he runs around acting like a lunatic. I cannot understand why this film was made or why $60 million was spent on its production.  It absolutely deserves a 0 out of 10 - there's not a laugh in it.  What does exist is a conceit to make a '60s caper comedy without a semblance of a plot, wit, or momentum - Johnny Depp in full gesticulation is supposed to make up for all of that.  Embarrassed for all involved except for Johnny Depp, who clearly knew what he was doing - and did it anyway.  Haven't seen a movie this poor, this miscalculated in many years.

The only other movies I have never finished watching before were 'Catwoman' (2004) and 'The Human Centipede 2 (Full Sequence)' (2011). Already, this is not a good sign for 'Mortdecai'.",

      "text": "Finally, i watched Mortdecai and i agree that is a low point to Deep's career, however i don't think it's that bad and it's probably my \"guily pleasure\", but The Lone Ranger or Transcendence were even worse...it reminds me of a british spy movie and somehow Deep quickly reminded me of Rowan Atkinson. This movie is a little strange but i really have fun with some jokes, but another just simply were flat and obvious...I think the biggest problem with it is that the sequences were much longer and they just put some scenes unecessary that makes the story go slowly. I think people are only making this movie a disaster because of Deep, who as always and no matter the movie, is great  but i want to see him as a real actor and not a caricature or a simple copy of Jack Sparrow, and the supporting actors like Paltrow, McGregor and especially Bettany are good additions...At the end, is not a disaster that many say, but i can understand because it has some fun but was stupid like that \"balls scene\" and even boring. All i can say is, it's forgettable but still enjoyable enough...",

It was not great from a technical aspect, but I found myself laughing in many parts, and even busting out laughing in some. I liked Paul Bettany and Jeff Goldblum, but everyone else was annoying. So check this out despite what critics say.",
