It seems like they're setting up the film so Hesher will become an unlikely champion for the young kid who is the butt of a bully's ire, but he does nothing but add to the kid's nightmare.  Even Natale Portman's character, who initially defends the kid, lets him down.

It's just as easy to like Hesher as it is to hate him, and the movie is better for it.  There were moments of the movie where you think he may make some sort of cliche turnaround to become a better person, and then he goes right back to his sociopathic ways.  There are some genuinely funny moments in this movie, and they're well-timed.  However, this is a drama, so don't go into it expecting a comedy.

Sort of wish the main character hadn't been so young in this movie because he almost seemed so young that he would be looked at as not understanding anything.",
