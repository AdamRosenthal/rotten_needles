You certainly never feel like you can root for Hesher (the character played by JGL). But the titles, the sountrack, a few of the set pieces (seeing Hesher climb up the telephone pole to turn on the porno channels for the house he's squatting in; watching him light a diving board on fire so he can act our Metallica's \"Jump in the Fire\", etc.) are interesting.  It seems like they're setting up the film so Hesher will become an unlikely champion for the young kid who is the butt of a bully's ire, but he does nothing but add to the kid's nightmare.  Even Natale Portman's character, who initially defends the kid, lets him down.  I suppose if you feel a little sadistic, you'll have fun with this one, but it's nothing like The Stoned Age or other \"fun\" movies it's reminiscent of.",

That's what we were told, but I didn't see Hesher as anything more than a nuisance to the them. It's unbelievable that no one would have called the cops on this guy! Anyway, ignoring the weak story and obvious plot holes, this movie was good because of its cast, plain and simple. JGL continues to be the most under-appreciated talent in Hollywood. I guess that's what happens when you start out on a sitcom. Newcomer Devin Brochu in his first major role was amazing as TJ, he's gonna be a big star one day. Even Natalie Portman, who I don't usually like, was great! Hesher isn't the best story ever written, at times it's slow, at others it just doesn't click, but the amazingly talented cast manages to keep your interest and makes this one worth seeing.",

Joseph Gordon Levitt does an amazing job in this role, and fits Hesher perfectly.  Obviously when a movie is called Hesher, the entire movie hinges on that character, and Levitt is great.  It's just as easy to like Hesher as it is to hate him, and the movie is better for it.  There were moments of the movie where you think he may make some sort of cliche turnaround to become a better person, and then he goes right back to his sociopathic ways.  There are some genuinely funny moments in this movie, and they're well-timed.  However, this is a drama, so don't go into it expecting a comedy.  All in all, this is a very unique, strange, and oddball movie.  It's well worth seeing it just for the experience of Hesher.",
