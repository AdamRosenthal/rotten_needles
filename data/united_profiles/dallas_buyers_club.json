Suddenly an outcast among his heterosexual friends, Woodroof reluctantly warms to a new community  particularly a drug-addicted transsexual named Rayon who becomes his business partner. Rayon is played by an earnestly committed Jared Leto who nevertheless comes off as a theatrical drag queen cliche. They run the buyers club together out of a cheap motel, the unlikeliest pair of Bonnie and Clyde renegades yet. Quebec filmmaker Jean-Marc Vallee (\"The Young Victoria\") directs \"Dallas Buyers Club\" with a loose naturalism, seedy environs and lively humour that prevents the film from becoming over-sentimentalized. It's a true story long in the making (screenplay by Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack) based on Woodroof's remarkable late life. But what \"Dallas Buyers Club\" is, ultimately, is the apotheosis of another transformation: McConaughey's great U-turn. A few years after sinking into rote romantic comedies, \"Dallas Buyers Club\" tops an astonishing streak for the 43-year-old that has included \"Mud,\"  Bernie\". He lost more than 40 pounds for the role (Leto, too, is startlingly thin), and appears so gaunt as to wipe away any memory of his rosier, more superficial performances. Extreme weight loss, too, can be a superficial ploy, but McConaughey inhabits the clamouring, clawing Woodroof, whose zest for life (which McConaughey has always exuded) flourishes with the meaning of a moral cause. He stomps down hospital hallways in cowboy boots, a foul-mouthed champion against the system, spouting obscenities in a Texas drawl. In one late scene that could be either Woodroof or McConaughey, he looks in the mirror, and smiles.",

A wall and a hammer reflect how she truly feels.  This movie depicts the Aids crises with enough sensitivity and honesty that make it a classic forever.

In this film, he portrays Ron Woodruff, a bull rider and electrician who tests positively for HIV. The film is loosely based on the true story of his buyers club that he starts for several other HIV patients with the use of illegal drugs. The film boasts a solid and talented cast. McConaughey gives what is, in my opinion, his best performance yet by far! Jennifer Garner also gives an honest performance as a headstrong doctor. Jared Leto returns to the big screen after his four-year absence from filmmaking as a transvestite named Rayon. His performance, along with McConaughey's is what really propels the film's conflict. Overall, the pacing is slow in some spots, but manages all the while to remain entertaining, thanks to the Oscarworthy performances from McConaughey and Leto. Definitely check this one out for an interesting take on a great true story!",

Its a movie about tolerance, acceptance, and the fact that our FDA is more concerned with profit than helping people recover.  McConaughey lost a lot of weight for the role and gives a great performance.  Jared Leto is also in top form as a transsexual who partners with Ron to sell the drugs to the gay community.

      "text": "\u2018Dallas Buyers Club\u2019 was a wonderful film about AIDS stricken activist Ron Woodroof, and his heroic attempts to work around the system to help other AIDS patients get the medication they need. Its set the 1980\u2019s, the early days of the AIDS epidemic; which was a time when the ignorant public shunned those with the disease, the US was divided over how to combat the virus and the FDA made selfish decisions on the way the  drugs were administered. In its truest form, this film was more of a character study about Woodroof, a homophobic, red-neck, electrician; who teams up with Rayon, a transgendered AIDS patient, to help others in the same predicament as him. Though initially for monetary gains, Woodroof, moved by his newfound friend, Rayon, and the plight of the sufferers, eventually puts a side the money and seek to help those with the disease, first-and-foremost. Matthew McConaughey gives the performance of a life time Woodroof; he not only loses an immense amount of weight for the role,, but he gives a truly powerfully performance about a man enlightened after realizing how short life is. Great work. With recent talks about the socialization of health care in America, this topic still somehow feels relevant to our time, and in no way out-dated. With such a smart screenplay, and directed with a strong balance of sincere emotion and witty humor, \u2018Dallas Buyers Club\u2019 easily evades the \u201cmovie-of-the-month\u201d feel that it could have become. Sometimes heartbreaking, \u2018Dallas Buyers Club\u2019 was a largely entertaining movie that moves at a clip, and manages to make you feel-good by its end.",

In ospedale gli danno trenta giorni e una medicina che lo fa stare peggio: Ron decide di reagire, va in Messico alla ricerca di una cura alternativa e, quando la trova, mette su un\u2019importazione parallela (nonch\u00e9 illegale) per distribuirla ad altri nelle sue condizioni attraverso il club di cui al titolo, ingegnosa trovata per aggirare il divieto di vendita diretta. Ad aiutarlo c\u2019\u00e8 soprattutto il travestito Rayon, che gli allarga a dismisura la clientela, ma presto arriva il contrasto con la rigidit\u00e0 della medicina ufficiale e con le case farmaceutiche: una battaglia persa, ma, prima di morire ben sette anni dopo rispetto a quando gli era stato pronosticato, Ron riuscir\u00e0 a ottenere, almeno in parte, ragione. E\u2019 curioso che, anche adesso che la malattia \u00e8 stata culturalmente metabolizzata, i film sull\u2019AIDS continuino a essere assai rari: l\u2019argomento sembra restare tab\u00f9 e anche questa sceneggiatura di Craig Borten e Melisa Wallack ha fatto una gran fatica a venire alla luce. Il progetto, nato quando Woodroof era ancora vivo, \u00e8 passato per tante mani ed \u00e8 stato finalmente realizzato solo grazie al contributo di McConaughey e al contenimento dei costi: solo venticinque giorni di riprese (se non altro, i due protagonisti hanno cos\u00ec evitato di morire d\u2019inedia) e attrezzature ridotte al minimo. Con queste ultime, il canadese Vall\u00e9e firma un dramma classico in cui si narra la parabola di redenzione di un uomo ignobile che ha il coraggio di sfidare il destino e i mulini a vento (ovvero Big Pharma), superando al contempo i propri pregiudizi mentre mette in mostra un fino a quel momento sopito spirito imprenditoriale. Come si nota, tutta una serie di classici temi del cinema statunitense che vengono per\u00f2 raccontati con il piede ben piantato sul pedale del freno: i patetismi sono banditi in favore di uno sguardo molto naturalistico (magari un po\u2019 aiutato dalla carenza di mezzi) che sembra ispirarsi a certe opere di Cassavetes. Il Texas che ne esce \u00e8 un postaccio, dove lo squallore degli ambienti si somma alle ristrettezze mentali di chi ci vive senza alcun desiderio di allargare l\u2019orizzonte: solo la malattia arriva a portare un sconvolgimento tale da far cadere le barriere, ma il prezzo \u00e8 venire esclusi senza piet\u00e0 dal proprio ambiente. Proprio per la capacit\u00e0 di narrare tale sconvolgimento, la prima parte del film si rivela pi\u00f9 interessante della seconda, dove hanno il sopravvento le disavventure del protagonista con la DEA e con la giustizia del suo Paese diminuendo in qualche modo l\u2019intensit\u00e0 della pellicola anche se l\u2019impostazione visiva rimane coerente: si veda il tristissimo ristorante in cui Ron cena con la dottoressa Saks (Jennifer Garner), l\u2019unica esponente della medicina \u2018ufficiale\u2019 che si degni di dargli ascolto. E\u2019 probabile che gli dia ascolto anche perch\u00e9, sotto i baffoni e dietro l\u2019aspetto pelle e ossa ottenuto perdendo circa venti chili, c\u2019\u00e8 il fascino di Matthew McConaughey, la cui prova d\u2019attore, con incluso tour de force fisico, \u00e8 il vero valore aggiunto di \u2018Dallas buyers club\u2019 che, grazie a lui, passa da lavoro discreto a pellicola da vedere: l\u2019immedesimazione \u00e8 sia fisica sia psicologica per una recitazione che, come il film, riesce a trasmettere la carica emotiva pur sforzandosi di non mostrarla in modo palese. Accanto a lui, gli altri attori danno vita a onesti ruoli di supporto (anche Garner risulta sacrificata e non \u00e8 particolarmente incisiva) con la sola eccezione di Jared Leto che \u2013 dopo una pausa di cinque anni \u2013 si toglie una decina di chili per incarnare un/una Rayon molto femminile: una bella prova solo messa un po\u2019 in ombra da quella di McConaughey che magari fa un po\u2019 la figura di quei chitarristi abbonati all\u2019assolo che mettono in secondo piano il resto della band ma, tutto sommato, meriterebbe proprio l\u2019Oscar.",

      "text": "Dallas Buyers Club is a performance movie. If you don\u2019t know what that is it means a movie relies on its actors and actresses to carry the plot. Usually this is because the plot is terrible and has no depth whatsoever, but the plot is one of the best things about Dallas Buyers Club. You probably know that it is based on true events and some of the stuff Ron Woodroof got away with is almost unbelievable. And it makes brilliant entertainment. But as I have mentioned this is a performance movie and the strongest thing about it are the performances. Matthew McConaughey is amazing and I think the reason behind it is he has just had what some are calling a McConnaissance, he has had a career change and is now planning to do more serious roles and less crappy rom-coms. Jared Leto I think is just as good, he plays a transvestite. And is not a transvestite in real life. That is a hard thing to pull off. But he does it extremely well and the hair and makeup artists perfectly show his descent into extreme illness. All of the supporting cast are brilliant aswell and compliment the lead cast while staying Oscar worthy, of course they haven\u2019t even been nominated that\u2019s how the Academy works. The only things about Dallas Buyers Club which I didn\u2019t like were that I had no idea who some characters were, they just sort of turned up. And the last shot was slightly clich\u00e9d, not the whole ending that was almost perfect. It was just the last shot felt a bit overly philosophical when it wasn\u2019t actually philosophical in any way. However Dallas Buyers Club is a hugely enjoyable and very intelligent movie overall, mainly due to the two leads Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto who practically carry the whole movie.",

However, both were great here and deserved their Oscars, if not just for this film, but for their body of work. Jennifer Garner is also good here, though she somehow managed to fly under the radar for many. The biographical elements here are solid and the film itself is a alright, but certainly not anything great. What really makes this one click is the aforementioned acting from McConaughey and Leto.

There is a tragic aspect to the film, because we as the viewers know that there is no cure and the Woodroof is desperately scrambling to find something that at most will let him live a little longer, and do something that will give him back a little human dignity.",

      "text": "Dallas Buyers Club uses the human drama of Ron Woodroof to explore moral and ethical dilemmas. How do we deal with death? The morals between one\u2019s own well being and the government coporations. These questions are explored through Woodroofs dilemma. Through Ron\u2019s arc from average cowboy porking to active treater to a fighter against the system it is all nicely conveyed. Matthew McConaughey gives a great performance immersing himself in the character and Jared Leto is unrecognizable. While I am lacking familiarity with the events the film was based off of on its own it\u2019s a well made film that deserves a watch.",

But the ones who shine the most are Matthew McConaughey who plays a broke rodeo cowboy named Ron who is suffering from AIDS and Jared Leto who plays a transgender named Rayon who is also suffering from AIDS. Together they start a club in which people can join and get special drugs that can help slow down AIDS and other issues that people have. This club is called the Dallas Buyers Club, hence the name of this movie. This movie tells the true story of Ron Woodroof and the club that he starts. This movie is fantastic! I give it a 9/10",

Particularly when in comes to a subject as heavy as the AIDS epidemic, there are going to be strong emotions, but Dallas Buyers Club is nothing but forthright and honest about telling it's story. Mcconaughey and Leto make a believer out of me. The script was so good that they simply needed to support it, instead both knocked it out of the park. Just a very enjoyable, poignant movie experience. Even if you believed that the creators of the film were trying to steer you falsely in a direction, at least they got the skeptics thinking about it.",
