Despite some jokes being either too flat, one dimensional, or too sadistic to arouse a serious laugh, most of the humor in this film works. You'll definitely laugh a lot as you watch it. As the film progresses, it loses it's comedic quality and, once raw emotion and pity are forced onto the characters, degrades into something like oil and water.

      "text": "Bachelorette was just not a good movie at all. There was very little humor involved, which was surprising considering that I thought Rebel Wilson had a large role and she's typically hilarious but that was not the case at all. Honestly, the only two reasons this movie was worth watching was Kirsten Dunst's character was actually pretty amusing, mainly because of the chaos that surrounded her. The main reason I was able to sit through this film was Lizzy Caplan though. Obviously I'm a huge fan of hers and she and Isla Fisher were the only reasons I even bothered watching it but Lizzy's character was great. She had one of the only funny roles and there's just something about her that is just awesome. She's got a type of darker hotness that is appealing and makes her different from most other actresses. If you're a Lizzy Caplan fan then watch this movie but I don't think most people would enjoy it at all.",

Based on Leslye Headland's play which she adapted, Headland has comic smarts and she can do better than this, she focuses more on the dark humor than the characters. Bridesmaids a control-freak Regan (Kirsten Dunst), slutty Gena (Lizzy Caplan) and a drunken airhead Katie (Isla Fisher) are apart of  their friend Becky's  (Rebel Wilson) wedding who they used to tease in high school. The film makes excuses to try to like the characters and it has a **** feel good ending. Kirsten Dunst and Caplan try to make this mediocre stereotypical comedy good but fail, Fisher tries and yet she can barely act. There are some enjoyable parts to this comedy, go watch this film drunk and you'll have a blast! But this comedy is racist, sexist. Grade C-",
