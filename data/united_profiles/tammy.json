While it is funny it is also unfortunately bogged down by some lackluster and overly-familiar dramatic elements. It's very been there done that, and often that will apply to some of the movies jokes as well. There are some times when the jokes just fall flat, but thankfully the overall movie does pack plenty of laugh-worthy moments even if it does play things safe at times by not straying too far from what is expected of R-rated comedies nowadays. It's a good comedy, and while it's emotional moments fail to deliver, Melissa McCarthy is still funny enough to make it worth a watch.

I don't want to flat out say that the movie was outright horrible, but for something meant to be a comedy movie, it doesn't deliver. The movie has it's funny lines sprinkled in, but the rest of the movie is just unfunny filler material. Overall, the movie comes off as cheesy.",

What shocking is it is co-written by Melissa McCarthy who was in two funny comedies \"Bridesmaid\" and \"The Heat,\" clearly she has comic smarts and talented, but her and her husband Ben Falcone wrote the script telling us that even funny people sometimes can't be funny. It's not funny, but it's heartwarming at times that's only credit I'm going to give this film. Melissa McCarthy is Tammy (the film's title) she is down on her luck, she is fired from her job from a burger-joint, her husband cheated on her, so she leaves and goes on a trip with her alcoholic grandmother (Susan Sarandon). Falcone is some good films such as \"Bridesmaids\" or \"Enough Said\" but as a director is it just lazy. 2/4 stars",

Such a great cast is totally wasted, why they would do a movie like this is beyond me!  I only chuckled once when she told the cops she had a bee in her hair and was running.
