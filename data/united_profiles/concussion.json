Concussion paints a great picture of the problems players are experiencing, and those that we as fans cheer for: big hits (which mean big problems down the road).  Will Smith turns in a solid performance, maybe Oscar-worthy perhaps, and helps anchor this journey.  While the learning of the horrific turbulence that is a concussion makes for a very engaging bit of film.   However, it's the life stories that hold the movie back.  Not that they aren't interesting, they just aren't portrayed very well compared to the bigger issues at hand.  If you're a fan of football, or you're out for some engaging drama, Concussion is worth a watch.",

Just a few years ago a large group of retired football players sued the NFL because they all had concussion-related issues, Concussion is about the beginning of that. Concussion is well acted, tells a well-timed story, albeit it being a little generic. The best thing about this movie is Will Smith, especially his performance as Dr. Bennet Omalu.",

Unfortunately, despite tackling some great source material, the standard presentation makes for a slow film that despite having a unique story is by the numbers and forgettable. Smith fans and history buffs may enjoy it but at the end of the day watching this movie is about as stimulating as playing football.",

Its a very engrossing film, that does a fine job showing how the NFL, glossed over CTE despite the harm it caused to their players and how it manipulated the public to protect their own interests to the detriment of others. The only negative I had with this film was how it washed over how WWE wrestler Chris Benoit was the first known case of CTE that went public, if it wasn't for Benoit being one of the first known cases of CTE going public then along with numerous other pro wrestlers dying then CTE would not be the boogeyman it would be known as today.",
