      "text": "Concussion offers an interesting premise that the world has been waiting to be taken to light for years. The film is a great story of the relatively unknown man who discovered the consequences of concussions in football. Will Smith is outstanding in this movie. I think this is one of the best performances that he has had to date. Dr. Bennet Omalu is simply good for the sake of good and he is easy to root for. Then you have a great supporting cast in Alec Baldwin, Albert Brooks and David Morse as Mike Webster. The downside to this very interesting story is the third act which derails the train a little bit and takes away from the story that we were really interested in. Concussion could also be considered a little biased or overdramatised but overall its a good watch, even if you are not a football fan.",
