Some people believe that all Christians think all films about God are great, but I think being a Christian actually makes me more critical of Biblical movies.  Son of God has some real emotion in it, and it's actually less preachy than many other faith based films.  That's not to say that the movie is sinless in cinematic terms.  The visual effects showing ancient Jerusalem couldn't get any cheesier in my opinion.  Even 14 year old Gladiator completely destroys the film on this front.  Of course, Gladiator had over 100 million in its budget, but I've seen free software create more believable visuals than seen in Son of God.  There are also a few clumsy moments in terms of storytelling, and it's really nothing new, but I think the film is good enough in terms of acting and directing to give a little boost to your faith if you're running low.  And you'd have to be a stone to not be in danger of crying at the crucifixion scenes.",

I was hesitant to see it when it debuted in our Regal Theater here after reading such a mess of NON religious types putting it down and I was amazed to tears on that Tuesday after it opened on  the Friday before. My love for religion is specifically centered in the AngloCatholic wing of the Episcopalian/Anglican communion my lifestyle is one of a straight-in-appearance,gay catholic Christian so this movie covered all the basics without plugging anything offensive to ME but if those who don't believe in His divinity or even his Trinitarian claim, that part might set you OFF.

I am a Christian and wanted a good movie about Christ and can not believe I would even write this. It is that bad. A plea to Mel Gibson please direct another movie just make it about Christ whole life this time.

Obviously Christian audiences are going to enjoy it the most, even if it has some inconsistencies here and there that aren't entirely factual. Once again those who have something against God, Jesus, and religion and general are going to hate it. That's sort of my main problem with the movie. Even though it does a good job of telling the tale it does nothing to give those outside of the Christian faith a reason to care. It won't give them any reason to doubt themselves or make them wonder, which is something I believe a truly great telling of the story of Jesus (and religion in general) should do.",

However, it was interesting to see another's vision of the life of Jesus-clothes, casting of disciples, etc. Most importantly, I think everyone in the movie theater was touched by the film.
