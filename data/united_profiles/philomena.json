La storia vera di Philomena Lee potrebbe essere perfetta per un settimanale scandalistico (come subito intuisce la cinica Sally) o per un filmone strappalacrime che colpisca basso. Giovane ragazza madre durante gli anni Cinquanta in un\u2019Irlanda bigotta oltre ogni dire, Philomena paga un giorno di gioia alla fiera venendo rinchiusa in un convitto di suore dove  prima costretta a partorire con dolore (figlio podalico e niente anestetico) e poi a vedersi portare via il piccolo Anthony, dato in adozione negli Stati Uniti. Cinquant\u2019anni dopo, la sua strada si incrocia con quella di Martin Sixsmith, giornalista politico rimasto senza lavoro, che si interessa a lei sperando di ricavarne una storia da cui ripartire, ma che ben presto si lascia coinvolgere aiutando la donna nella ricerca del figlio perduto. Ricerca che riserver\u00e0 piccole gioie e grandi delusioni, oltre a una bella arrabbiatura che scuote Martin al confronto di una pacificata Philomena. Pronti i fazzoletti? Neanche per idea: Stephen Frears tiene con sicurezza le redini alternando il dramma a delicati tocchi di commedia che scaturiscono dall\u2019incontro fra due persone diversissime  il laureato a \u2018Oxbridge\u2019 che ha girato il mondo e la donna del popolo, infermiera per una vita, che si entusiasma per i romanzi rosa e le banalit\u00e0 da piccolo schermo  lavorando su una sceneggiatura di Steve Coogan e Jeff Pope, tratta dal libro del vero Sixsmith, tanto efficace da venir premiata a Venezia e costellata di battute da ricordare (tra le pi\u00f9 belle dell\u2019anno quella sul suonare l\u2019arpa e i gay, forse non correttissima, ma va ricordato che si tratta di una madre che parla del proprio figlio). Del resto, Coogan, attore e autore comico per la televisione britannica, ha preso talmente a cuore il progetto da esserne anche produttore e interprete: il suo ruolo, per\u00f2, non pu\u00f2 e non vuole essere che quello del comprimario, perch\u00e9 al di l\u00e0 dei meriti di tutti quanti, il vero pilastro su cui il film si regge  l\u2019interpretazione di Judi Dench. La sua Philomena  una donna addolorata ma forte che, quando riesce infine a dare una risposta agli interrogativi della sua vita, trova l\u2019energia per chiudere i conti con il passato e guardare avanti. Nei momenti pi\u00f9 intensi, Frears stringe il primo piano e la signora, incurante delle rughe, sa restituire un\u2019emozione (o un mondo di emozioni) con la profondit\u00e0 dello sguardo per poi regalare altrettanta classe a un duetto brillante con Coogan nei momenti pi\u00f9 leggeri. I due personaggi principali sono il fulcro della narrazione, il che spinge inevitabilmente gli altri sullo sfondo con la sola eccezione di Sophie Kennedy Clark che interpreta la giovane Philomena: discorso ben diverso, invece, per quanto riguarda una natura che si erge quasi a co-protagonista. Tutta la pellicola si svolge tra l\u2019autunno e l\u2019inverno, ma mentre c\u2019\u00e8 il gelo nelle immagini che narrano l\u2019adolescenza reclusa di una ragazza sottoposta a regole che, pur solo a pochi decenni di distanza, ci paiono impossibili, sono le pi\u00f9 calde tonalit\u00e0 autunnali ad accompagnare gran parte dell\u2019azione nel presente: si passa cos\u00ec dai paesaggi ancora verdeggianti di un\u2019Irlanda umida ma fascinosa al coloratissimo foliage che fa da sfondo alla trasferta negli Stati Uniti raggiungendo il massimo del suo splendore durante la decisiva visita a Pete Olsson. E\u2019 qui che, dopo aver vinto le resistenze dell\u2019uomo, il cerchio si chiude con lo svelarsi di un\u2019ulteriore cattiveria che tira in ballo ancora una volta le colpe della chiesa cattolica in Irlanda, la cui spietatezza controriformistica ha raggiunto livelli abnormi anche a confronto di un Paese cattolicissimo come il nostro. Da quando \u2018Magdalene\u2019 ha squarciato il silenzio, si  saputo di tutto e \u2018Philomena\u2019 aggiunge un altro mattone: a parte qualche lodevole eccezione, come la levatrice suor Anunciata, il sistema (incarnato da suor Hildegard) era strutturato per ottundere e reprimere perch\u00e9 il peccato va espiato nel dolore (una delle prime battute) e il piacere altrui non  ammesso (una delle ultime).",

While this film is often dark, there is plenty of levity as well, and we both left the theatre thought-provoked, entertained and satisfied at an hour and a half well-spent. Indeed, when I got home I wanted to Tweet Steve Coogan, whom I had only known as a comedic actor, to congratulate him on his choice of role and his work as the film's producer (turns out while he has an account, Coogan is not yet active).
