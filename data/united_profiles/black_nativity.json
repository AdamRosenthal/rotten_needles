Some guys down in the front row began to openly mock her which caused other movie goers to let out a few chuckles they had been holding in.  The kids I took with me were enjoying it so I stayed for the whole movie but wanted to leave.  I was curious how they would weave Langston Hughes's Black Nativity story into the movie itself but it was barely spoken about except for a brief showing mid movie.  Overall I got the impression that this movie was merely a vehicle for Jacob Latimore who sang his parts very well.  I found it hard to empathise with his character though.  I kept hoping that he'd get caught, shot or arrested so that we could finally get past his dredged up problems to the Nativity.",
