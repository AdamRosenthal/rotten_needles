      "text": "RED and Flightplan director Robert Schwentke's paranormal action flick R.I.P.D. is based on a comic book of the same name by Peter M. Lenkov. For everyone else involved, it's a Men in Black sequel that swaps ghosts in for aliens. That's OK  the MIB franchise rests on chemistry and that's what makes R.I.P.D. halfway tolerable. Ryan Reynolds, the perfect leading man who can't catch a break in Hollywood, stars as Nick, a Boston cop trying to carve out a life with his French lovely, Julia (Stephanie Szostak). Nick has made on major mistake in that genial plan: At his most recent drug bust, he helped his parter Hayes (Kevin Bacon) steal some ancient gold he thinks can be pawned for serious dollars. Why was there ancient gold stashed away in the crates that carried illegal drugs into Boston? This is one of the many blanks R.I.P.D. asks you to fill in. \"You have seen enough movies, it should be easy,\" the script silently says to us as it speeds along to make its 90-minute runtime. When Nick decides he's out of the corrupt gold smuggling plot, Hayes shoots him in the face. That would be the end of most Boston cops, but it turns out",

Everything about RIPD is reused and fashioned out of spare parts other movies didn't want. It's a poor man's Men in Black as it follows the same formula (two partners, one old, one young, one recently recruited, the other a seasoned pro who still has things to learn.) It's vapid film making that only really stands out thanks to its comic book action sequences and stellar CGI action that MIB didn't have back when the originals came out. Everything else is unfortunate mimicry that is just plain painful to watch.",

Honestly, aside from the slightly different story, this movie is like Men In Black. Good CGI, but just a horrible movie all around. Its movies like this that make me mad because this is a recycled idea and a horrible one, at that, but the fact Universal Pictures would green light this over, say an original idea from an up-and-coming screenwriter, is quite frankly embarrassing.

Kevin Bacon is also very believable. The only thing i take issue with are the special effects. They're very disappointing. All in all, its a nice movie, not without charm and should not be judged solely on the fact that MiB came out first.",

This review is not going to be very long because I haven't got a lot to say. The acting is terrible, yes even Kevin Bacon. The plot is impossible to understand, not that it made much of a difference, and (quite obviously) stolen from Men In Black. The CGI reminds me of a 1980's Doctor Who episode. The action is straightforward, without brains and easily forgettable. The ending is such an anti climax that it brings the movie down by a whole point. The only aspect of R.I.P.D which is done well, is the mildly entertaining humor which made me laugh a few times. Simple sentences used to simply describe a dumb and simple Men In Black rip off which was made solely to entertain under 18's. And it doesn't even do that!",
