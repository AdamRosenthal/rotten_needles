Nick has made on major mistake in that genial plan: At his most recent drug bust, he helped his parter Hayes (Kevin Bacon) steal some ancient gold he thinks can be pawned for serious dollars. Why was there ancient gold stashed away in the crates that carried illegal drugs into Boston? This is one of the many blanks R.I.P.D. asks you to fill in. \"You have seen enough movies, it should be easy,\" the script silently says to us as it speeds along to make its 90-minute runtime. When Nick decides he's out of the corrupt gold smuggling plot, Hayes shoots him in the face. That would be the end of most Boston cops, but it turns out",

When NIck (Ryan Reynolds) is murdered hi is enlisted by the RIPD, the Rest In Peace Department, a group of undead officers including Nick's new partner Roy (Jeff Bridges) that hunt deados, undead that refuse to just die and cling to life until Roy and Nick and the rest of the RIPD can bring them in or destroy them. Everything about RIPD is reused and fashioned out of spare parts other movies didn't want. It's a poor man's Men in Black as it follows the same formula (two partners, one old, one young, one recently recruited, the other a seasoned pro who still has things to learn.) It's vapid film making that only really stands out thanks to its comic book action sequences and stellar CGI action that MIB didn't have back when the originals came out. Everything else is unfortunate mimicry that is just plain painful to watch.",

Hardly a good actor, why do we care? Anyway, the whole time I was watching this movie, I kept thinking one thing: Men In Black. Honestly, aside from the slightly different story, this movie is like Men In Black. Good CGI, but just a horrible movie all around. Its movies like this that make me mad because this is a recycled idea and a horrible one, at that, but the fact Universal Pictures would green light this over, say an original idea from an up-and-coming screenwriter, is quite frankly embarrassing. But then again, Universal is hot off the heels from all that money Fast & Furious 6 just made them. They can afford to create and release a horrible movie.",

Jeff Bridges is just fantastically amusing and clearly doesn't care how over-the-top he is or how much scenery he eats in every scene and Ryan Reynolds is decent as his partner.  The special effects on the villains is really hard to digest as they just look absolutely terrible but the film has its fair share of funny moments, has a decent story and some fun, popcorn action going for it that makes it a very passable comic book adaptation.",

Ryan Reynolds and Jeff bridges have some good chemistry and the whole idea of them having a different idea because they are dead made for a few laugh out load moments. The story is also surprisingly action packed and the action scenes are quite exciting i must admit. however this movie suffers from a horrible, predictable, and cliche story. I could almost predict everything that was going to happen like in the movie San Andreas and that is never a good thing. Haven't the director ever had an original though before?
