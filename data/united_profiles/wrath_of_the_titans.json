No one went to this movie because they cared about what happened to Perseus. Everyone who went, went because they saw that this film is jam packed with monsters, some of the best CGI that rivals that of Avatar, and lots of action. The best part? The crew who made this movie acknowledges that. The previews show lots of action and lots of monsters. They had a series of short youtube videos talking about the monsters. Because that's why they made this movie, and let me tell you this, they did it almost to perfection. The monsters look amazing (especially Kronos) and the action with them is intense and fun to watch. This is a movie to see in theaters with your friends (that's exactly what I did). It's a great action film and it delivers it with a constant sense of danger that keeps you almost at the edge of your seat unless it's the scene with the Makhai (the two torso creatures with four arms towards the end) that makes you fall back in your seat and your jaw drop. Just like with Clash of the Titans, it's advertised as exactly what it is. I give it a 9 for doing so and because it is so awesome.",

Characterization was almost non-existant - Oh, don't misunderstand me, there was of course we all the formulaic characters; The reluctant hero, the family traitor, the flawed but ultimately redeemed father.  The dialogue was appalling - several lines seemed ripped straight out of Star Wars (\"I know there's still good in you.) And of course when it comes to historical accuracy, well, Hollywood is notorious for being weak in that department. The greatest delight of this film was it's visual effects, which were thrilling to the eye and I quite enjoyed the architecture of the labyrinth.

What audiences see, even in 3-D, are multi-limbed and headed CGI creatures, \"unanimated\" and lifeless, being rigidly juxtaposed to real-life people who take swing after swing to their unhuman counterparts, and miss time after time; apparently, as long as a computer image has the appearance of falling and dying onto the ground, the need for the same animated creature looking as if he had \"been hit\" is not important. Much like a Rocky-Creed bout (only without the use of computers), the punches here don't connect. Essentially, what the audience sees in 'Wrath' is an exhausted use of expensive, yet poor quality, effects that fills the entire length of the film; in the past such effects were used on occassions to \"add to\" scenes, not to \"fill\" runtimes. But, don't feel bad because your inexorable sense of exhaustion was surely shared by the actors of the film; you think watching this is bad, what about the actors who had to wave swords against air?

Overall I feel the pacing was much better than Clash and more intense. The mythology aspect was improved upon as well (although not following much to real mythos), but the involvement of the super natural was a lot heavier. The only real complaints are there wasn't much explanation for the basis of the story or reviving Cronos... It kind of just is happening. The characters weren't too deep, but honestly I wasn't expecting that anyway. Sam Worthington is improved but still so-so. Either way, I was entertained and so was the group I went with.

The biggest drawbacks are the accents that some of the actors have, particularly Sam Worthington.  I can't understand half the things he says, and he is the main character.  Another problem is the HORRIBLE \"Shaky Cam\" throughout the movie.  Better take a motion sickness pill before this one.  You can't see what is going on in any of the major fight scenes.

Although i am a huge fan of him, Sam Worthington is not the best actor in the world either. On to the positives, the biggest improvement was the 3d. The 3d was very good for this film. I saw this with my cousin and it was funny because multiple times he tried to dodge what was coming at him in the film. This comes as a bit of a surprise to me because this along with Clash were both converted into 3d which means they are filmed in 2d but converted to 3d afterwards which usually comes up with very poor results such as what happened with Clash, but Wrath of the titans was very good 3d wise, and action wise. The action was fun and very entertaining, and there was some surprising comedic relief as well. Good action film, great 3d film, but poor plot-wise and the majority of the acting as well.

D'une part que cette suite se montre bien plus rythm\u00c3\u00a9e (gr\u00c3\u00a2ce \u00c3\u00a0 une plus faible dur\u00c3\u00a9e : 1h27) et ne se prend que trop rarement au s\u00c3\u00a9rieux. Apr\u00c3\u00a8s, lors des moments justement plus s\u00c3\u00a9rieux, on s'enfonce dans une niaiserie rarement atteinte, l'ensemble manquant encore plus de sc\u00c3\u00a9nario que le film pr\u00c3\u00a9c\u00c3\u00a9dent et un casting toujours aussi in\u00c3\u00a9gal. De m\u00c3\u00aame, La Col\u00c3\u00a8re des Titans est tr\u00c3\u00a8s efficace, mais on a tout de m\u00c3\u00aame l'impression qu'il manque ne serait-ce qu'une once de spectaculaire... On sent la volont\u00c3\u00a9 de bien faire pour livrer un divertissement de bonne facture mais on sent \u00c3\u00a9galement que le tout est b\u00c3\u00a2cl\u00c3\u00a9. Alors que dire? Finalement, je pense qu'il faut trancher ainsi : La Col\u00c3\u00a8re des Titans n'est qu'un blockbuster am\u00c3\u00a9ricain de plus, qui ne cherche qu'\u00c3\u00a0 divertir les spectateurs avides de ce genre de spectacles, sans pour autant casser la baraque. En somme, m\u00c3\u00aame s'il se montre diff\u00c3\u00a9rent du premier sur quelques points, La Col\u00c3\u00a8re des Titans ne vaut gu\u00c3\u00a8re mieux que son pr\u00c3\u00a9d\u00c3\u00a9cesseur, sans \u00c3\u00aatre pire non plus.",

It was stupid, a terrible ending to an otherwise decent movie. This was about the opposite, the movie itself wasn't as good but the ending did hit hard. Chronos destoryed a few villages and got some heavy hits on main charaters before he died. Also his two sided warriors were cool. The movie got the action the only thing it's missing is any resemblence of a story line! Everything seems broken and disjointed, I really didn't care or have any feelings for anyone that died, including Hephaestus and he was more or less a main character. I don't understand why most of the Gods died, and it did a poor job at explaining why they did that. All in all, the action was great, but the movie was terrible. I think that warrants and even 5.",

More monsters and action than the first one, with the as-expected excellent special effects, and that makes me give it about the same score as the first, otherwise this would've gotten a 4. As one reviewer said the fight choreography was subpar  and that same reviewer pointed out that it was extremely similar plot to Immortals (and he's right!). I'd say the acting is actually better in this one. Standard reluctant hero and family betrayal/drama/redemption plot so nothing new there. Not terrible, but I wouldn't say it's good either.",

Why? Because this movie is just TOO short! 90 minutes is not nearly enough to squeeze in all of the excellent things this film has to offer. This movie feels a lot like Lord of the Rings, the soundtrack, the creatures, a lot of moments almost felt like the same ones from LotR, but it's Lord of the Rings if the entire trilogy was squished into 90 minutes! I would love to see another film or remake that takes this and extends it to a good couple of hours.",

The one time I got a chance to see \"Clash of the Titans\" was when I was 12 and I went to Universal Studios in Orlando and was so tired from spending the day out and walking around and whatnot that I ended up falling asleep while the movie was on. That said, I still wanted to see what \"Wrath of the Titans\" was capable of. I figured that, even if I didn't understand the story too much, I probably wouldn't care because neither film was made to tell a beautiful story. And all in all, I was right: \"Wrath of the Titans\" is pure, brainless fun. The story is forgettable, the characters are uninteresting and the acting is nothing special, but the visuals are gorgeous, the action is pretty exciting and, should you choose to watch it in 3D, you'll find it to be a lot more fun (if a bit too exhilarating because they throw everything and the kitchen sink at you during the film). Don't walk into \"Wrath of the Titans\" expecting a brilliant cinematic masterpiece, but expect it to be a nice, brainless diversion.",
