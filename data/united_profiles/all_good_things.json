But in \"All good things\" not every reasons are explained because the director is telling a real story(the names of the characters in the movie were changed)that is still a mystery and the leading actor of this drama is an enigma. David Marks(Ryan Gosling)son of a powerful real estate man(Frank Langella)tries to establish a perfect and peaceful life with his wife Kathie(Kirsten Dunst)by avoiding his duties in the family business(legal and illegal).But it won't be easy for him to resist at the pressure by his strong father and he will be forced to take part of the ominous projects of his persuasive father.Besides,his increasing psychological problems will destroy his life with his wife.The second part of the movie is a shocking and bizarre look at the last years of the disturbed man and the homicides of his two friends.And the movie becomes a sort of \"Psycho\". What we see is the results of murder investigations. I liked the mixture of themes such love,corruption,madness,mystery and murder and Andrew Jarecki did very well in showing the growth and reasons of the characters,although David remains an enigma in many of his actions.I really liked the details he offered and I was drawn from the beginning to the end.The movie is predictable in some parts but in the last one is a real unexpected turn.Ryan Gosling was great in playing a troubled man and I was moved by the portrayal of this poor soul that had no chance to live in peace with himself.Also he shows some sinister sign of madness that are really overwhelming. Kirsten Dunst was simply terrific in portraying a victim of the husband and his powerful family but also an ambitious woman who tried to get advantages by the the whole situation in terms of the prospect of a wealthy life.For her amazing acting she should have been nominated for an Oscar.Frank Langella was really good in the role of the cold and manipulative father.The three characters are really complex and not easily categorized.\"All good things\"is probably one of the most appealing and interesting movie of the year.It has real great and original moments and although it doesn't provide an easy solution to the case it is not a distracting thing in my opinion(since it's still an open case).",

Not once while sitting through this did my attention drift off, I was glued to the tension and incredible atmosphere. Once finished and the creepiness had subsided, the faults with the story began to surface and thats where the problem lies!! The Story is fragmented and skips from decade to decade with no regard for the time between. The story says based on actual events and 'intense' research, but feels speculative and contrived. The acting however is brilliant and the direction, if patchy is slick and attention grabbing. This movie is a bit half and half, but I feel that for a movie with such big faults to hold my attention for so long and honestly make me think, deserves a little more than a pass!!",

This one is stranger than fiction and the fact that Durst still trots around free with Daddy's millions has to gall all those who value justice. The story really needs a four part series. We never get to see the detective work done and why Durst walked away from his wife's (presumed) murder. We never see much of the trial for the murder of his lodger and have to wonder if folks in Galveston are rubes. Gosling is good as Durst, who was diagnosed as having Asperger's but seems way more competent than that. Frank Langella gets to do his customary \"heavy\" role as Durst Sr. In the end it;s such a mish mash of fact and supposition that I was left irritated by the conceit of the Director's presumptions",

The direction and pacing are solid, but my main drawback here is the flashback storytelling that comes and goes. I think it was an interesting approach, but I am mixed on how effective it truly was.
