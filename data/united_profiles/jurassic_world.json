So much of the script however feels like it was written by ten year olds that you're consistently taken out of the experience.  (The raptors for the military sub-plot is absolutely ridiculous.)  There's no sort of dramatic depth to be found anywhere and the actors are all playing pretty flat characters.  This movie has the assembly line produced feel to its core.  The original Jurassic Park felt like something that craft went into, a movie designed to leave an impression.  It also seemed to take place in a more realistic, less goofy cinematic universe.

The movie is bigger than the original: More dinosaurs escape, more people are in the park when it happens, and CG is overused with reckless abandon. Obvious nods to the first JP are milestones separated by groan-worthy story arcs (the two boys with the unhappy parents could have just not been in the movie and nothing would have changed, yet we're forced through awkward minutes of them discussing their parents' impending divorce) and are shoehorned in with such frequency that one could easily believe this movie is nothing more than a cash-in. Moments like these lead to one which took me out of the movie entirely, like one where the jeeps from the first park are made to run using twenty year old gasoline, oil, and batteries. Sorry, Jurassic World, not in this or any reality. The movie culminates in a grand climax that is ruined when a t-rex and a velociraptor give each other a 's'up bro' nod afterward instead of attempting to kill one another as they should have.

The characters are so dim that they easily would have tried to run the park after three previous disasters. No doubt the film had great scenes of dinosaurs wreaking havoc but the human stupidity was beyond unacceptable. Who designs a ride that allows guests to have complete freedom to roam wherever they please unsupervised? Why did the owner of the park blame his lead scientist for doing exactly what he was told to do? Why are carnivorous dinosaurs all of the sudden not attacking humans? Why did they tell us that the T-Rex was coming back and not include it more? After watching for 45-60 mins you basically guess the purpose of the original monster if you haven't done so before even watching. Why is the T-Rex not destroying everything? Once again, I loved all the dinosaur scenes just not so much the look at the cute little velociraptor scenes (entirely too many of them) I wasn't looking for a smart movie, just one with maybe the most basic common sense.

Seeing Claire's sister unnecessarily  burst in to tears for Claire not personally giving her nephews a tour of Isla Nublar which has ,by the way,became a fully functional Dinosaur zoo and theme park(man,isn't this exactly what each of the other three movies professed people NOT TO DO) seemed  artificial and downright pathetic. The first movie scored big with the two kids that irritated and ultimately won over Dr.Grant,but the Director's mission to win over the audience with the same formula falls flat this time around. Chris Pratt as the raptor trainer(ya, believe it, Velociraptors have accepted him as their alpha - gosh!!!!) brings some solace to an otherwise mediocre and horribly miscast movie which feature a clueless  theme park owner and  a pot bellied head of security,to name a few. Even though the story about a genetically modified   'Indominus Rex' (cool fake name)  terrorizing the visitors and the other dinosaurs had a great appeal, the execution leaves a lot to be desired. The best chance for the movie to salvage something was in its climax where an inter dinosaur battle ensues between the mutated beast, the raptors and the park's resident super hero,the T-Rex. Even though die hard fans of the franchise might distinguish a T-Rex from other big carnivorous dinosaurs,most of the audience aren't  paleontology experts and not mentioning that the beast attacking the villainous I-Rex(??) was indeed  the  Tyrannosaur  seems a bit lazy on the director's part and adds to the lack of attention to detail displayed throughout the film. The Mosasaurus' spot at the end could have been the perfect finale to the film,if it had a competent director at the helm.",

I went into this with extremely low expectations and I won't claim its unwatchable or the worst thing ever but this movie is seriously in the running for the worst JP movie and that says alot, considering how badly the 2nd and 3rd movies were picked apart I fully expect this one to be torn apart piece by piece by more thorough reviewers in the months to come. I know many reviews have already said this but the acting, the plot and the character development are all awful. there is no other way to put it, all the characters are walking stereotypes and there is nothing in the way of a Grant/Malcolm to try to salvage this with their banter, it's just good guys/bad guys and a bunch of rehashing of previous ideas with even less to hold it all together. The best way I can describe this movie is that it's not a story but it's spectacle on par with a circus act. A huge chunk of the movie is just showing off the park with its cgi crap and then a SUPER dino gets loose and causes chaos, that's basically the entire movie. I found myself rolling my eyes several times at both the 'story' going on here and the literally cringeworthy product placement. I kid you not there's a scene where the 2 brothers have just witnessed a dino exhibit and one of them says \"wanna see something really cool?\" and the scene immediately cuts to a close up shot of a mercedes benz(this close up panning outward shot of the mercedes logo happens at least 2-3 more times throughout the movie) and this is not the only example going on here. What's incredibly ironic is that the movie actually takes a shot at product placement in the first 30 minutes, using one of the minor secondary characters to mock the idea of corporations naming dinos and sponsoring the park exhibits. But even beyond the nitpicking, the real problem with this movie is the total lack of character development and the poor directing/acting which leads to a total lack of suspense in a movie that in theory is suppose to be suspenseful and frightening. By the time the last 20 minutes were rolling around I was thinking \"this is almost over and absolutely nothing of substance has happened\" right before you get blitzed by a big stupid dino brawl and an unsatisfying ending that is basically a copy of the previous endings but 'BIGGER'. Unless you're just looking for some Michael Bayesque mindless tripe to spend 2 hours on I highly suggest saving your money and go find something better to do. This is just another cash grab using an established franchise and doesn't deserve the money it already has and will continue to rake in.",

Why sit through a retread when you can watch this same story with superior characters, story, effects and action. Jurassic World isn\u2019t terrible it just doesn\u2019t become anything more than brilliant. Its better than the sequels but it isn\u2019t saying much.

If you can do both you can enjoy this film, which as is the tradition contains meaningless 3D. If you\u2019ve seen Jurassic Park you\u2019ve seen this movie done better. If you are ok with more of the same you\u2019ll have fun with it but if you want something no and creative this film won\u2019t do anything for you.",

The problem is, they are just moments of greatness, in what is otherwise a mediocre film. Part of the film feels like a do-over of something that has been done before. Which wouldn't be so bad if they'd committed to it. The characters are all less likable than previous installments. The dinosaurs are less scary too somehow. I know they obscured most of the gore for the rating. But its more than that. They can make a CG dinosaur more accurate and dynamic than anything 15 years ago. And then they move wrong. Too fluid, not enough like the animals they are based on or the established dinosaurs of previous films. There is this whole dinosaur behavior thing which didn't really work. They were too human in some instances, and then too \"dumb animal\" in other instances. They didn't show any \"battle damage\" either Sometimes the CG use breaks immersion too.",

      "text": "Jurassic World was a great way to reinvigorate this film franchise. The first two were incredible but the third film left a sour taste in most people's mouths so this movie had a lot on its plate. If it flopped it would've certainly been the end to this franchise for a long time until years down the road Hollywood gave it the inevitable remake treatment. However, if it succeeded in delivering a quality product that fans would enjoy, the sky was the limit. Well, lucky for us fans, it delivered a really good film. With regards to the cast, Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard do a great job as the male and female lead counterparts; Vincent D'Onofrio once again takes the role of the villain and he does so masterfully; Jake Johnson provides great comedic relief throughout the film (maybe too frequently to be honest); to be frank, the only weak part of the cast were the two child leads. In what has become an unfortunate cliche in this franchise, children were given too large of a role and they couldn't deliver the necessary emotions. The first film got lucky there... more often than not, banking a large portion of your film on the capabilities of child actors is a mistake. Thankfully this was not a movie entirely reliant on acting so it wasn't a grave error but trying to emulate the magic of the first definitely hurt the movie a bit. The film also failed to deliver quite the same edge-of-your-seat thriller experience that the first two did. A lot of that had to do with any sense of unknown being eliminated almost immediately. In the first movies, you rarely caught a glimpse of the \"villains\" (T-Rex or the Raptors) during the build-up of the suspense. This helped create a certain tension that really captured you. This movie doesn't manage to do that at all. Instead, Jurassic World is an action movie that has dinosaurs, humor, and solid acting. Essentially it felt like a 21st century superhero movie but instead of Iron-Man or Captain America it had Velociraptors and an Indominus Rex. The problem is, it shouldn't be that type of movie at all. Nonetheless, the action, the nods to the original film (which was probably my favorite part of the movie), and the dinosaurs devouring people makes this worth the price of entry. Just don't go in expecting it to building on the originals.",

Jurassic World is a thrill ride. It's a roller coaster, pure and simple. It's made by newbie Trevorrow, and his love for the material quickly shines through. Watch out for this guy..he's talented. A lot of the critics seemed to be jaded by this film. Maybe they expect more character development? Well, the original didn't have it as well. But what we have here are younger, more attractive casts, including new A-liter Chris Pratt.

      "text": "Like Alan Grant in Jurassic Park, I would ask Director Colin Trevorrow 'How did you do this?'. Firstly Jurassic Park is one of my all time favourite movies. I saw it when I was 11 and loved it ever since. As for the sequels, The Lost World is watch-able and Jurassic Park III does not even deserve the JP title. The series lost its way and you would have been forgiven for thinking, as I did, that any more sequels would have no chance of being halfway decent. It defies reason then that Trevorrow can come to this franchise with only one film under his belt and produce the best sequel to Jurassic Park. Not only that but Trevorrow set out to recreate the feeling of what it was like to watch the first film back in 1993 and for me he damn near succeeded. The only thing that stopped it feeling like a full 1993 nostagia package was that I had seen the dinosaurs before. Everything I had been concerned with in the trailers just works. Chris Pratt and the Raptors - its great! The I-Rex is genuinely the scariest creature since JP's T-Rex. And as for the T-Rex, his reappearance later in the movie was entirely predictable, highly anticipated and awesome. The whole film feels like a breath of fresh air with a promising future that entirely ignores parts two and three. I can't wait to see it again . . . it can't be as good as I remember can it?",

Having screenwriters from Rise of the Planet of the Apes' franchise, the engineering field of genetic modification works efficiently on the historic extincted animals and at the same time allows the plot to stress on the greediness of human nature, the ethical and morality behind as well as the dire consequences. Scores from Michael Giacchino mostly remain the original theme composed by John Williams, creating a sense of revisiting the old park while performance of Chris Pratt sparks with his serious characteristic throughout the entire film. The story is further well balanced with intense action sequences, fury battle between the dinosaurs and splendid visual effects although there's a few scenes of obvious CGI flaws. Overall, director Colin Trevorrow has transformed this mid-range Spielberg efforts into a satisfying adventure much better than the previous two sequels - The Lost World: Jurassic Park and Jurassic Park III.",

I thought that it could go the wrong way or in a good way.Fortunately, for me, it went the right direction. The Indomitus, the most proeminent aspect of that new approach isn't an aberration. Instead, he is clever, dangerous and use several natures best hunting tactics and, foremost, he hunts for sport! It's a unstoppable killing machine and impose a lot of fear. Speaking of which, i saw i different kind of terror/fear in this movie and i liked it! The deaths are pretty scary, mostly because the directors decisions about camera angles. But not only that, the soundtrack and the situations cause a large sensation of fear, it captured the fear of death right before people got caugth by their nemesis. It deviates from previous movies, which, for me, were much more cartooned-like. It's a psicologycal terror, the fear before death that really added to the more dark atmosphere of the movie. In this movie, i felt the wheight of the deaths, the effects on people and it impacted me a lot. Another point that i feared that could go the wrong way was the raptors  training. I expected that they did that in a silly form, you know, like, \"hey rex, go get that bone\". But it wasn't like that at all. Instead, that aspect is very intriguing, and the spectator stays apprehensive all the time, because you never know if the raptors will attack or if they will act accordingly. Its very unpredictable and sounds very much like how it would be if that really happened, so is another point of the movie that overlapped my  expectations.  The plot is acceptable and so the carachters. A bonus and praise for Crhis Pratt, wich, for me made a solid carachter and conducted is role very well. His caracther is cool, without loose that sense of responsability. For  those who says he could be more funny like his previous roles, like Guardians of The Galaxy, i disagree. That role need a strong and responsibility man and a funny guy wouldn't fit in the genre.The dinos are fine e vast and the (spoiler) King is back, so i couldn't asked for more. They are everything i wanted to see. No feathers and others stuffs. Just the old and gold reptiliam gore!!!!!! I think that compare it to the first movie is a sin. Is like compare Alien with Aliens, both have their own merits and are good in their peculiar aspects, because they have diferent goals. That is the way i see Jurassic World, no need for comparisons. Ultimately, i think the movie pay respect for the previous movies and is very nostalgic at times, but without disconnecting from its own reality, and that is definitely what this movie is about! We are not in 1993. We have technology, people got tired of the same dinos and the movie brought all that new stuff without losing its soul. For all that said i consider this a very very good movie and i loved every moment of it.",

If you were a fan on the original you will be pleased and if you were not a fan then might not like it. References are the best especially if they are not canon. Bringing back things no matter how small make you look back on your childhood after watching this. But in every now and then action movie there has to be a child actor for the kids.

      "text": "Director Colin Trevorrow\u2019s \u201cJurassic World\u201d ushers in the next stage of summer blockbusters for 2015 this week. Starring Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard the film plays as a direct sequel to the original \u201cJurassic Park\u201d released 22 years ago this week. Both \u201cThe Lost World: Jurassic Park\u201d & \u201cJurassic Park III\u201d are still considered a part of the shared universe but neither of the latter films are referenced. Instead \u201cJurassic World\u201d plays up the nostalgia of the first film and has many included references. The film is definitely a must see of the summer and does play better than both of the previous sequels. Unfortunately it cannot compete with the awe and wonder one felt watching the first film in the series back in 1993. A simple formula is followed in this film which should surprise no one. Man creates dinosaurs, dinosaurs eat man, man brings Chris Pratt in to fight dinosaurs, and scene. As simple as it sounds though it still works. Pratt is the real deal and the whole time I was watching the film I felt like I was watching an audition tape for a new Indiana Jones movie. The man is fun to watch and believable in his role. Bryce Dallas Howard flies under the radar early in the film but then really starts to shine as the film goes on. Her character was also the most unbelievable element in a film full of dinosaurs though by being in high heels the entire time. The supporting cast was good with Vincent D\u2019Onofrio, Irrfan Khan, Jake Johnson, Omar Sy, Judy Greer, Lauren Lapkus, and \u201cJurassic Park\u201d alum BD Wong. I especially liked Khan\u2019s role as Simon Masrani. D\u2019Onofrio\u2019s character was interesting before turning into a walking clich\u00e9 by the third act. Now onto my only real gripe with the film, the kids. The performances were fine but I found neither actor, Ty Simpkins or Nick Robinson, to be charismatic or enthralling in any way. I didn\u2019t care what was happening to them or what was going on in their lives. It is another pointless child inclusion storyline that Hollywood includes in their films because I guess they think it appeals to a broader audience. I must say though when I was a kid I didn\u2019t care about if there were kids in the movie in a significant role. I just wanted to see whatever the heroes were doing against the dinosaurs, monsters, aliens, etc. This brings me to the thing we all want to see, the dinosaurs. They were thrilling and wonderful to see as always. I felt the rush of excitement from my 8-year old self finally getting to see an Ankylosaurus, one of my favorite dinosaurs growing up, in action on the big screen. By the end of the film everything culminates into a fantastic dino-action scene; high heels and all. So go to the theater, grab that rail seat, and kick up your feet for an enjoyable dinosaur experience. Don\u2019t blink or you\u2019ll miss Jeff Goldblum and Jimmy Buffet\u2019s small inclusions. Buffet\u2019s was especially humorous.",

Jurassic World takes place 20 years after the original \"accident\" with Hammond's park thriving with attendance and focus groups, everything we've come to expect from Corporate America (wink wink). To help boost attendance, or perhaps wallets, a new hybrid will be debuting. The problem is the hybrid has been kept in isolation and soon figures out, I don't deserve to be in a cage I deserve to create havoc. While much of the plot seems unoriginal, credit must be given to the filmmakers for paying homage to Spielberg. As Spielberg continues to make movies, his style of filmmaking becomes quite present and in return, if one follows the blueprint, you have an homage.

      "text": "Being a 90s kid I grew up on these movies. Being born in 1993 and the Jurassic Park movie releasing in 1993 these movies were always my favorite. Not just for the thrill but for the love of dinosaurs in general. I went and saw Jurassic World the day of release. There's honestly not a negative thing I can say about this movie. Taking a movie that came out over a decade ago and revolutionizing it to fit a modern appeal was not an easy thing to do. Going from the original Park being a private opening, and going to a Park open to the public there is a lot of things that would have needed to be done to make it the way it should be. the only negative thing I can say about this movie is it should not have been released in 3D. It's kind of a cheesy way to present this movie. But that's my opinion only. If you are a big jurassic park fan and love all of the books and movies, then you should not be disappointed with this movie. I saw it on  the 12th and am already wanting for it to come out on Blueray. Comparing this movie to the original is like comparing a 1920 car to a 2015 car, there's no reason for it, the originality of the first Jurassic Park is great, but this is a sequel not a \"original movie\". I would love to see this series booted back up into more movies or possibly even a TV show to see how Ingen rebuilds.",

Jurassic World was everything John Hammond wanted this place to be, but since the dinosaurs were lose in Jurassic Park (1993) and the park was at risk it was obvious that it was not to be released in the public\u2019s eye. Jurassic world is fully operational and the lab created a hybrid dinosaur that will attract more visitors once this thing gets out it will eat people, (okay this film does copy the first one). Jurassic World is astonishing; I was waiting for the moments in the trailer to be showed in the film and once they were showed it was awesome, it was better than the third one, this film is two hours filled with dinosaurs chasing people and eating them, people running for their lives it\u2019s groundbreaking but it\u2019s not even close as being good as the first one. So Bryce Dallas Howard plays Claire, she is an executive at Jurassic World she tries too hard to make Jurassic World perfect all she cares about is what the public wants. After \u201cGuardians of the galaxy\u201d Chris Pratt shows that he can act and he is good in this movie; so he plays Owen, a former navy man who is a Velociraptor whisper (think of him as the trainer or something), so Claire wants him to take a look at this hybrid dinosaur but he tells Claire and the lab that is a bad idea (yep this film is filled with idiots!). So Claire\u2019s nephews Mr. Lady\u2019s man (Nick Robinson) and his perky little brother (Ty Simpkins) come to have fun at Jurassic World, they ran away from Claire\u2019s British assistant and have fun together at the wrong moment then the hybrid dinosaur is on the lose trying to kill for sport (what is with the script it copies off the first one). We can tell co-writer/director Colin Trevorrow loves Spielberg\u2019s Jurassic Park franchise, the way he is behind the camera. And he tries to bring to the \u201cJaws\u201d formula and collages them together I am not sure if it\u2019s a good idea. Trevorrow and his team create new special effects that are good but it\u2019s not fresh like Winston\u2019s team did back in 1993. Pratt as the hero was awesome the way he brings the charisma to the project he\u2019s like Dr. Grant\u2019s intelligence mixed in with Ian Malcom\u2019s humor. Bryce Dallas Howard was a great heroine in this film she is like Ellie\u2019s charisma mixed in with John Hammond. The problem with the film is the script it has too much backstory and it tries to copy off the first one back in 1993, it does not have intense anxiety like the first one.",

However this movie was not without flaws but let's start with the positives: Chris Pratt was by far the best character in the movie and this role cements him, in my opinion, as a young star. The action was well directed and there was good comedy relief throughout the movie. The new dinosaur worked as well. The negatives are that the cgi was not convincing in some shots and I feel like directors can't just rely on cgi these days. Spielberg understood that you need to have machine dinosaurs that look perfect in close up shots. There are also two boys in this movie that didn't really add anything and kinda dragged the movie down when I wanted the movie to focus on chris and killing the dinosaurs. Also, the opening shot of the park where the  iconic music starts was just embarrasingly underwhelming. I mean the song was playing when it shows the park and the inside of a hotel! Whoopdi Doo! I didn't watch the movie to see real estate! Another thing, I mean the movie doesn't address, at all, how the hell the lawyers and the government allowed this park to be reopened after the catastrophes of the past. With all that said I highly recommend you watch the movie. It's a great time.",

I felt like a kid again watching this! Though it doesn't have the same punch or as many awe-inspiring moments as the first Jurassic Park, this was a refreshing change of pace for the franchise. And even though The Lost World: Jurassic Park in my opinion is a very underrated film, Jurassic World is very worthy successor to the first movie and is a much needed improvement over the last two sequels, even The Lost World. I really enjoyed the fact that a lot of elements in the first movie make a comeback in this film. Chris Pratt's character is also the best the part of this movie and makes a lot of elements in this film that could have been super cheesy into cool and badass instead. My two major complaints though are that some of the supporting characters are not very well developed, and there are times where the movie gets very predictable. Other than that, have fun! It's a fun roller coaster ride with dinosaurs and is also the best Jurassic Park sequel to date.",

Jurrasic World puts to the table, John Hammond's vision of the Park redisgined, boy does it look spectacular. Isla Nubar is the Disneyland for kids of the generation. It was very cool to give it a theme park vibe and that surpasses the original theme park a million times. Technology has advanced and Jurassic Park has aged with grainy picture shots and laughable technology gizmos, but it worked. World features stuff that is attracting to our generation. I remember watching it on VHS and just loving every single moment, well acted and directed movie, Jurassic Park.

No not even close because back then we had never seen dinosaurs come back to life so realistically.  So basically coming in we knew what to expect as far as the story goes.  Kids sent to a relative in Jurassic World, this time an Aunt as opposed to Grandfather John Hammond.  Every precaution is taken to protect the guests but as we all know the guests are food for the nothing can go wrong dinosaur theme park.  Chris Pratt as the hero recreates the same character as in the blockbuster hit Guardian's Of The Galaxy, a modern day Harrison Ford if you will.  Whatever can go wrong does go wrong.  And Chris Pratt's character comes to the rescue for the kids and falls in love with the ice cold Aunt who happens to be the director of the park.  It's just a great popcorn flick for the entire family.  The special affects are absolutely outstanding.  Look for this movie to take in over $100 million dollars this opening weekend.  Fun movie everyone should enjoy as long as you know going in it's feeding time for the dinosaurs.",

I'm not saying that I want it to be exactly the same... but what made Jurassic Park movies so great was the, \"Oh crap, a dinosaur is hunting me\" feel. Because there was just chaos everywhere... and we kept getting thrown around the park without it building any suspense for certain situations. I really felt disappointed that I went and spent money on 3D movie tickets, popcorn and soda for me and family... Maybe that's because I download most movies and rarely go to the theater... and I expected my first theater visit in a while to really WOW me... but it didn't. I'm not saying it was horrible.

I loved Jurassic Park and felt that both sequels didn't do justice to the original, so when they announced that this film would go on the premise that the two sequels never happened, I was extremely excited. Like everyone else, I rushed to the theaters to see, the exact same film I saw twenty years earlier. The tech is better, the effects are better, but the story is almost identical, to the point where each character has an equivalent in the original film. In Jurassic Park, the T-Rex escapes while the kids are in a car, touring the park. In Jurassic World, the Adominus-Rex escapes while the kids are in a sphere, touring the park. This is just one example of literally dozens of parallels to the original film. The only real difference is Chris Pratt, as he is a hell of a lot more believable than Sam Neill was, and his infectious personality makes him the type of guy that everyone wants to be friends with. From his simple start on the WB's Everwood to becoming a Guardian of The Galaxy, Chris Pratt has established himself as one of Hollywood's brightest future stars, but aside from his performance, this is the same film! The Jurassic franchise has the benefit of being created by one of the greatest science fiction writers of all time. It is produced by perhaps the greatest Director of all time, and once again it introduces moviegoers to some amazing new special effects, but none of it matters when the story just isn't there. With this film people were hoping for something new and exciting from the franchise, a turn in a whole other direction, instead they got a film that is little more than a remake of the original, and a disappointing one at that.",

But instead, they have to play out the worst-case-scenario and that's when all the implausibility happens and everyone goes, \"gimme a break\", like when the two kids outrun I-Rex at first, and then every time after that. When leads Owen and Claire go all \"Romancing the Stone\" on us running through the jungle with no training and in street clothes, and when all the flying dinos get loose in the park mall, everyone's just running around in the open getting picked off one by one like Hitchcock's \"The Birds\" on steroids.  Then the final dino fight scene could've been superiorly epic but the director had to keep weaving the leads in which just added more and more stupid. The film's SFX were fabulous but forcing the integration of humans with them was this film's primary failing, as it is in so many other films.

(I saw it in 3d with a significant number of other people, but not at an IMAX, or other particularly impressive screen, and the sound setup was merely decent there. ) This is the kind of movie that is all about the spectacle, and has a very mediocre script. That said, the acting is actually pretty good, especially Chris Pratt, but including the others, which makes it all the more unfortunate they didn't spend a tiny portion of their budget to  make sure they could get a good script. I'm sure that for a few million they could have easily hired a few great writers to bang out a script that would have had it rise above this mediocrity.  Obviously they didn't need to, seeing its success, but I think it hurts the brand long term, as people tire of pure spectacle in the same universe.",

It can? Wow! Jurassic World is an absolute thrill ride from start to finish, with a great script, great performances, great music, great visuals, this is certainly a worthy entry to the Jurassic Park franchise. The Script is great, very tense but also very funny at points, although the focus is slightly cloudy at points I can overlook this, the performances by, yeah everyone are great, Chris Pratt and Bryce Dallas Howard give strong tense performances, Vincent D'Onofrio is great as the film's primary antagonist, Irrfan Khan and B.D Wong shine throughout the film, and even Jake M. Johnson and Judy Greer give stunning performances in their rather limiting roles, but I think it's Nick Robinson and Ty Simpkins who really shine here, their roles are simply the run away from the big dinosaur roles, but they turn them into something deeper and more interesting, this is without a doubt the best cast in Jurassic Park history (just a shame there's no Sam Neill). As for direction, it's great, Colin Trevorrow did a great job in recapturing the feeling of amazement of watching Jurassic Park for the first time, although personally I prefer Spielberg's direction in Jurassic Park and The Lost World, and even Johnston's direction in Jurassic Park III, but it's still first class direction. Summing up (finally), Jurassic World is a worthy addition to the franchise, hell I'd say it can compete with the 1993 original, but for me, that film will always reign supreme. Fast, Fun, and Epic, the cast and crew have really captured a certain type of awesome that hasn't been seen for about 22 years, nice one guys!",

So when this movie was finally released i was one of the first people in line to see it. And for the most part i really enjoyed this movie the acting was good for the most part particularly by Chris Pratt and even the two younger siblings i thought did a good job. I thought that the love story was a little forced but to be honest it was such a small part of the actual movie it didn't matter to me. And the dinosaurs were awesome. The cgi has come such long way that they looked real. And it was amazing to see the park finally open in all its glory. Which brings us to a very important part of the movie. The Indominous Rex I thought that the Indominous Rex was awesome and added a new and interesting twist to the Jurassic Park franchise. Some people complained that they thought this was more of a monster movie than a Jurassic movie however i have to disagree i thing that this movie was a good ending note the the Jurassic franchise and i am glad that the position this movie holds no longer belongs to Jurassic Park 3",

Filled with WOW moments and callbacks to the 1993 Spielberg directed film (Dr. Wu is back, the night vision goggles, the same jeeps), as to say \"move over JJ Abrams there is a new Spielbergian in town and he ain't Gareth Edwards !\". This should be the sequel we've been waiting for right ? well that just depends on YOUR expectations. For me though personally the B-Movie story and the pseudo science behind the new (not really a) dinosaur is terribly ludicrous making Jurassic World another casualty to the phrase \"Leave your brain at the door\". But that doesn't mean it's not \"fun\" at least in some parts, Chris Pratt plays Raptor wrangler Owen Grady who (along with his raptors) acted as the glue that held this monster of a movie together since the other characters (with the exception of Masrani and Dr. Wu) were badly written. Even Bryce Dallas Howard couldn't make her part believable because her character was the typical \"i'm a stuck up business person that tries to suppress my human emotions\" then toward the end becomes \"i'm no longer stuck up because my emotions were brought out by the plot happening and now i'm in love with Owen even though there was almost no buildup to the relationship\". I will reluctantly give a pass to the child actors in this movie even if their reactions to some situations were questionable and the out of nowhere \"our parents are getting divorced\" conversation that didn't go anywhere was random like most of their dialogue. But we can't pay attention to that because obviously the 4 writers of this movie didn't because the kids were created so that the audience could go with them and see the attractions of  Jurassic World and that's a somewhat justification. The not too shabby 3D and the D-box seat I was in made the film more enjoyable amplifying the experience of it's strengths, the sound and the effects. Overall, It wasn't as great as the hype machine made it out but it's not as dreadful as the last 2 sequels making this movie a brass knuckled gut-puncher with the inscribed words \"It's Alright\" embedded into your stomach like so many summer blockbusters before it.",

I'm not going to say that this film is better than the original because there is so much material that is inspired by the first film. Many characters resemble the classic characters in the original film and there are several shout outs to the 1993 classic throughout the film. Chris Pratt said that this film was a film made by a Jurassic Park fan for Jurassic Park fans and that could not be anymore true. The dinosaurs look great, and the action is so outstanding that I had my popcorn finished before the movie was halfway done. Chris Pratt offers a bit more star power than this franchise is used to and he proves that 2014 was not a fluke for him. He does not show the level of humour that he had in Guardians of the Galaxy but he is still very funny and he grabs your attention in his scenes. Bryce Dallas Howard was also amazing and I really enjoyed her performance. There are also great supporting cast characters like Vincent D'Onofrio and the comedic relief Jake Johnson. What prevents a perfect score for me is the overuse of the original films magic and I found that the two young boys in the film take up a little too much of the screen time and although by the ending you can tolerate them, they are kind of irritating for the first few minutes. If you get an opportunity to see Jurassic World in theatres take advantage of it because it could be the blockbuster of the summer.",

Better plot, better acting, better direction. The characters were believable, the kids were as likeable as Lex and Timmy were in the original. It is what you expect from Steven Spielberg. I was wondering if they were going to include a cameo by any of the characters from the original, and they did, although it was a minor character. Remember the smug Asian scientist in the lab in the first one, who said, \"Are you implying that a group composed entirely of females will...breed?\" He is in this one also, 22 years older, still working in the lab. Lots of references to the original movie that felt nostalgic. I also noticed that some scenes must have been filmed at Universal Studios (This was a Universal movie) - we just returned from vacation during Spring Break where we visited Universal Studios, and we immediately recognized the long, steep escalator that takes you from the lower level where the JP ride is, to the upper level where the rest of the park is.",

It's the the same T-rex from the 1st film. CGI: could of been better for Rexy but, production already had more pratical affects, then JP1. Also, CGI is not everything / just as video game graphics. Ex: OG mario vs The order 1886. Also, how a *stage* would be set up, racing games are graphically superior with room need compared to something like Eso or skyrim that have a huge size but lowered graphics / / as compared to Godzilla being that racing game and Jurassic World being skyrim.",

I found these two mysterious kids as a left over that I don't even think I'll remember them, although it's confirmed that there will be another one. Chris Pratt felt kinda flat and to me he was really boring character, which I don't consider him a badass in my awesome mind. And Bryce Dallas Howard gives nothing special throughout the whole film. Now let's just move on to the action sequences. It gives it all, and it's more violent than the last three films which it did a great job in that. And the last fight, it felt real and gives you the suspense face. I'm just going to leave this review here and hopefully it doesn't cause hate.",

However like all Jurassic park sequels it doesn't live up to the original. I think the last scene was a bit cheesy and was just there to please fan boys of the t-rex. It also builds up all this hype for dinosaurs and we hardly get to see any. The Jurassic world scene annoyed me slightly as the camera just pans across buildings and not dinosaurs.

The special effects themselves looked good and most times it felt like they represented the dinosaurs accordingly but sadly it feels like most of the movie takes place in a studio full of green screens with hardly any on location filming. Acting from the Movies main star Chris Pratt is quite good as usual, Chris himself dose fall into that generic action hero role and doesn't stand out in this role as much as his others. Everyone else kind of just blends together and wont make much of an impression on you. The most enjoyable part of this movie is obviously just watching Dinos fight each other and kill people, witch is at some points is very bloody and gorey witch is nice to see they didn't try to hide the violence.

      "text": "Finally, we get a Jurassic Park sequel that isn't completely idiotic and mind-numbingly boring. Jurassic World ignores the events of The Lost World and Jurassic Part III and introduces a new theme park 22 years after the first park closed where dinosaurs roam free, although it's more similar to something similar to Disney World than the original park. In order to spike attendance again, the park has created a new, bigger and scarier hybrid dinosaur, the Idominus rex, but the big guy escapes his enclosure, and it becomes a hunt for the dino before it makes its way to the resort. Jurassic World does take its time until the action really begins. The first act is completely dedicated to showing the park in its normal operational design, and while it is slow, it does try to capture the sense of wonder that the original Jurassic Park had. The dinosaurs in Jurassic World do look fantastic. It's great to just be able to marvel at them for the first 30 minutes. But this is a Jurassic Park movie; we want to see some dinosaur action. Luckily, the movie knows that point when to crank up the action, and it's actually quite jarring. It goes zero to a hundred really quickly. One moment I was watching the dinosaurs, a bit bored by this point, and the next I'm bracing my seat because of the sheer intensity of the film. Jurassic World is a seriously violent and visceral film. It's probably one of the most violent PG-13 movies I've seen since The Dark Knight, but the violence is about on par with the other three films, so you should know what to expect. The slow opening act makes the rest of the movie extremely effective and thrilling, and while Jurassic World didn't have anything as terrifying as the kitchen scene in the original film, there are plenty of scenes that will melt your face off. If you have the chance, go see it in IMAX 3D. It's definitely a movie you need to be completely immersed in to get the full effect. If you're a fan of the original Jurassic Park or you like newer monster movies like Cloverfield and Godzilla, Jurassic World is the movie to see this summer.",

The movie was a bit predictable at times and the movie is only 2 hours and 4 minutes but so much happens that movie feels 20 minutes longer than it actually is. The begining was really cool where the doors swing open and it's like Christmas came early. The kids didnt annoy me as much as I thought they would. The ending fight was a great part, better than the 20 second fight in Jurassic Park 3. The Indominus Rex was a really good feature and Mossarasus Dinosaur got a really cool kill on a very minor character. My main problem is the dialouge sometimes isn't the greatest and the comic relief didnt always hit. If they do another sequel like there planning on doing I hope they do get another directer, Colin Treverrow did do a good job but I ended up getting to hyped up and I was disappointed but the movie was enjoyable for what it was, A Jurassic Park movie where the main dinosaur antagonist is a monster not an actual dinosaur.",

As a whole, it is a worthy sequel to the original, although it lacks some of the heart and the overall feeling of awe and wonder.",

It was clever, action packed and pretty revolutionary for the time that it came out. The two that came after... well... the first one was watchable, and I did kind of enjoy it, but the third? Well. I guess not  having Spielberg on board didn't help. Alas, Spielberg was the executive producer for this film, and needless to say, the third probably would've been much more enjoyable had he worked on it. This film was GREAT! It was the type of film that they made movie theaters for. It was loud, terrifying and fast-paced, which will help keep your grandpa awake as the film progresses. Although the story is pretty predictable, the cinematography and action scenes make up for it. The two kids in the movie don't really help the story progress in any way, they did set up one of the coolest scenes in the movie. I won't spoil it for you though. Well, here are my final thoughts on the movie:",
