      "text": "The Equalizer was one of the most underrated shows of the 1980s, it was a great show, but it always lacked a certain intensity that the lead character needed. In this 2014 film adaptation of the series, Director, Antoine Fuqua, made sure that didn't happen again. Denzel Washington stars and can play anyone, but I find he's at his best when he's playing a dark loner like Robert McCall. McCall, a former CIA operative has retired and is attempting to live a normal life. Everything is going as planned, until he sees a young girl being abused, and decides to take action. McCall believe he's just going up against a local pimp, but discovers it's a lot more complicated than that. Washington continues to be at the top of his game, as the ageless wonder is once again spectacular. This film is everything I loved about the series, with a whole lot more action and intensity. Director, Antoine Fuqua, has been on a role after films like Training Day, Shooter, and Olympus Has Fallen, and he has become THE guy when it comes to action films. Playing off an established franchise and paired with Denzel Washington, The Equalizer has come back to life and is one of the most refreshing action films I've seen in a long time. Sometimes with a different team, what was once old, can become new again, and I was practically jumping out of my seat with excitement. As far as the continuation of the series goes, Fuqua is in the early stages of a sequel. It may not be a new TV series, but it's still something exciting for the fans, and I for one can't wait to see more.",

If there\u2019s a line, The Equalizer walks on it like an acrobat on a tightrope. Antoine Fuqua\u2019s most recent work establishes itself as a crowd-pleaser, leaving spectators in awe, but every fluctuation between nonsense and coherency creates uneasiness and raises eyebrows. One might think: I hope this guy knows what he\u2019s doing. Fuqua\u2019s previous feature, Olympus Has Fallen (2013), felt like that too: an action packed thriller, forgoing all plot consistency, continuity and common sense for the sake of staging uncontrollable mayhem inside the White House. Since his deservedly acclaimed Training Day (2001), the American director has seemingly found it difficult to keep up with expectations. He has, nonetheless, always had good eye for action scenes, managing to build remarkable and gripping sequences. Much like some of his past works (King Arthur and Brooklyn\u2019s Finest to name but a few), The Equalizer suffers the pains of lacklustre direction. The tasteless use of alarm clock shots to set temporal continuity, or the abundance of dull and redundant digressions, are only a couple of examples. Nevertheless, the film also offers great action, riveting exchanges, and a likeable, cathartic anti-hero.",

This isn't the first time director Antoine Fuqua and actor Denzel Washington have worked together. Training Day was a film that produced a Best Actor for Denzel, so I was particularly excited for the two reuniting in an action film. However, this ain't your average action film. Fuqua really knows how to direct compelling action with an artistic framework. He's not like other directors who feel the need to unnecessarily shake the camera to hide the atrocious fight choreography and create cheap adrenaline, he actually uses the action to tell the character's story. You learn more about Washington's character through his fighting than you do through his dialogue. The film also had a strong antagonist, played by Marton Csokas, who had as much screen presence as the protagonist himself, which most action films lack, however, like I said before, this ain't your average action film. All that and a riveting action sequence that takes place in a hardware store should be enough to get your blood pumping for days on end.",

It just becomes tedious to watch when no matter what injury is suggested, you know that the hero will simply get up, shrug his shoulders, and then continue on to dispatch everyone else - usually without any consequences. It appears all heroes are now automatically assumed have absorbed Wolverine's self-healing capacity. For example, at one stage here, the Equalizer gets shot (and blown up), is apparently seriously disabled, and even has to be dragged to safety by an onlooker . But one minutes late, he is back, dealing death through the judicious and malevolent manipulation of domestic hardware.  It all becomes a bit silly after a while.

Denzel Washington did a good job of playing the Black Ops badass in this movie, and I enjoyed when the Russian scumbags pushed his buttons and forced him to act. This movie was entertaining, which is why I go to the movies. If I wanted a cerebral movie about a broken black ops operator, I would watch Man on Fire. This was basically a sequel to Man on Fire with a different character and story. In the end, the girl causes him to snap and do bad things to people who deserve it.

This is also because(SPOILER ALERT) I feel like this was all about that 1 girl that Bob was trying to save and that it wasn't about The Equalizer or him trying to equally save everyone like the movie title suggests or hints to. They tried to show that he was Indeed  an \"equalizer\" but it wasn't enough for me the theme of the movie should have been explored more. However if they make a 2nd Movie where the theme of Equalizer is demonstrated and explored in a better fashion the score goes up to a 10 or 9.75 to be critical. Other than that the movie is amazing if you don't like gore and extreme violence this movie is not for you.",

Martin as the villain was phenomenal, he was smart and he definitely pulled no punches. I would like to say that this film is very well constructed.

      "text": "The Bad: This movie, much like its reviews, is very clustered and unsure of its intention and goal, starting and finishing stories with no real conclusion to anything. On the action side we have long periods between each action scene making it a put off for those who were hoping for a straight action flick. Those were the bad things about this movie. The Good: The first thing to mention is Denzel Washington's ability to make nearly all of his characters relate-able and likable, even when playing a murderous killer who violently dispatches his enemies. Which brings me to my next good point, although the action is few and far between, the parts we did get to see were brilliant. Avoiding a straight shootout whenever possible and going or more creative fight scenes made this movie a more watchable experience for all audiences, making you crave the action that little bit more. Another point i would like to mention is that the villain played by Marton Csokas was very creepy and intense, making him an enjoyable villain to watch, although a bit more character development for him would have been nice, they do start some, but it never really goes anywhere. All in all i give this movie a 7 as it was enjoyable to watch, with great action scenes and acting, but the story itself was not all that linear or clear, it just seemed to be about a guy who helps people because he can, but never explains why he does or should, and a villain who kills for the same reason.",

But that is only a one-off bait for his Oscar consummation. As one of the most consistently bankable actor in Hollywood (at least in the domestic market), Washington\u2019s good-man card never fail his audience, bar his sortie in portraying an ambiguous character as a drunken pilot garners him another Oscar-nomination in Robert Zemeckis\u2019 FLIGHT (2012, 7/10). So this reunion is more or less commercial-oriented than an ambitious art-house attempt as  Fuqua has established his status as the Hollywood go-to action journeyman after producing profitable outputs like SHOOTER (2007) and OLYMPUS HAS FALLEN (2013).",

Bout the only thing this movie has going for it is that it's easy to sit down and enjoy. How much you enjoy it really depends on your love of action and/or Denzel movies honestly but it's very easy to follow and it clearly does not want you thinking about the various plot holes too much.

For one, Antoine Fuqua did a mediocre job with the directing role. It almost felt like he had never directed a film in his entire life, found a list of all the cool camera tricks, angles, and cinematic effects, and felt compelled to include each and every one of them. How did this impact the movie? It made it seem as though it lacked any identity whatsoever. Secondly, there is a critical moment in the final major conflict resolution that is just terrible. To avoid spoilers, let's just say that the protagonist that had been established throughout the film makes a decision that he would never make. That, combined with the plot getting a little out of hand, made the last quarter or so of the movie hard to swallow. It wasn't all bad, however, as the rating should reflect. The acting was great and fighting sequences were done incredibly well. The build up and initial character and plot development were fantastic too. Unfortunately this film suffered from having a director who wanted to do everything instead of making a great movie.",
