      "text": "God bless America is easily, in my opinion, one of the best combinations of Dark Comedy and Drama I have seen in Years. Watching this film was a great Experience, and it was easily one of the best independent films I have ever seen. The Plot is a dark spiral of Hilarious Insanity and Turmoil, filled with some of the best Social and Political Commentary, Exquisitely handled Themes, and Ridiculously dark (And Funny) Shock Humor, a good example being in a fantasy scene where the Protagonist imagines killing his neighbors, and shoots their baby with a 12 Gauge shotgun when The Mother tries to use it as a Human Shield. In my opinion, there are two major selling points to this film. One is the Social Commentary, and overarching theme. Which portrays a man seeking to rid the world of Stupidity and, seeing how he thinks he is dying, develops a sort of Jigsaw Complex, which drives him to make a difference by eradicating the source of it, albeit in a very Morally Ambiguous way. While i don't Condone the actions, it is something that could be debated if this sort of action could be considered something that could be a step in the right direction or not, which is one of the highlights of the Film. The other reason why this Movie is worth watching is the Female Protagonist. This is easily one of the best Characters I have ever seen, which is also eloquently portrayed by the Actress's skill to emote, and convey with subtlety. She's Independent, Insane, and wants to see idiocy destroyed, and she's the best Driving Force to help Frank find the strength to stand up for his cause. The Ending is exquisite, being reminiscent of Bonnie and Clyde, combining with them going out in an absolute blaze of glory, being the rebels against stupidity. Also, the plot has a great way of connecting all the events in a relatively seamless way, and does a great job at keeping everything coherent for a Comedy. Naturally, though, there are a few problems. The Dialogue can be a little stilted, some of the jokes don't hit bulls-eyes, and the Social Commentary, to some, will be offensive, but honestly, it needs to be. This is a great statement about where we are headed, and how we need someone to stand up for intelligence and decency, albeit in a more...... diplomatic way. But honestly, if Frank and Rory came through, and asked me to join with them, I would. It might not be the most ethical thing, but at least someone would be trying. Over all, this Film is exquisite, and honestly, I love every second of it, and easily gets my Seal of Approval.",

I think his intention was to express frustration and discontent with the malaise that is our current American culture, albeit in an exaggerated manner. Nonetheless, I can empathize with said frustration of the film's antiheroes. Now the hard part for me isn't resisting the urge to go on a killing spree, with America's most conceited, bigoted, self-absorbed idiots out there as targets. The hard part is willingness to throw my Android phone off a bridge into the water below. Either way, I find God Bless America to be the most entertaining film of 2012 so far.",

But ultimately, the film's ccharacters are no better than the targets of their wrath. The is one way I could givev this movie a 10. If you interpret it as a condemnation of the people who will get off on it. In a way, the ending reminds me of the ending of Inglourious Bastards, where the audience is watching a film in which the heros massacre an audience full of Nazis trapped in a theater watching a film in which the hero kills their enemies. I'm not sure the film is really smart enough to have that double edge to it, though. There are numerous occasions when the protagonists rant and rave about the vulgarity of the culture, before immediately revealing themselves to be nothing but the flip side, another example of the vulgarity they condemn. As if going on a killing spree to protest incivility isn't sufficiently ironic.",

      "text": "God Bless America, a dark comedy involving a depressed middle-aged man who goes on a killing rampage on those who 'deserve it' with a teenage girl has its morals all twisted up. The film attempts to make statements about what's wrong with pop culture and America and, while some of the declarations are affecting, it is mostly just wrung out with hypocrisy, as the characters enacting the killings are no better themselves. It starts out with promise, making some good points, but then we begin to realize that about every scene contains a drawn out monologue of, not so much nihilism, but hating everything for no backed up insightful reason. While the plot is self-aware and ridiculous, the character of the teenage girl is absolutely unlikable, foul-mouthed, mean, and with no background to suppport her behavior. Enjoy God Bless America for its dark/funny massacres but not its moral. I don't think we are meant to anyway.",

      "text": "The hypocrisy of God Bless America lies in the fact that the whole film rails against the death of creativity in American life and the conceptual solution, the murder of everything and everyone that toxically feeds upon the ignorant, is too easy in itself. The fact that the vapid morons populating the headlines are more entertaining than artists and scientists is indeed frustrating, but the beauty of this world is that anything worth doing is difficult. This movie takes the easy way out and probably appeals more to those same ignoramuses who are hungry for drastic comedy over intelligence. I can appreciate the originality and a few agreeable rants, but it was best left as a daydream, I'm positive, Goldthwait had one afternoon.",
