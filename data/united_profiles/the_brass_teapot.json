As far as I know she has not donned in a comical role so it was good to see her in this movie as one. This is the role she needed the most after all her previous roles were pretty much serious. The chemistry between her and her counterpart was excellent. The direction was nice, it was her first full length venture which was adapted from her short movie of the same name.",
