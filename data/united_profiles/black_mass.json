This is the spirit we look for in \"Black Mass\", and Johnny Depp, complete with ice blue contact lenses, puts in one of his best performances as a ruthless genuinely frightening James \"Whitey\" Bulger, the infamous South Boston Irish mobster who made a Faustian deal with FBI agent John Connolly to help eliminate the Italian Mafia in Boston and get all the spoils.    That part did happen, and history of organized crime tells us that Boston was not that prominent for mob business, and was subservient to Raymond Patriarca, the godfather of Providence, who in turn reported to the Gambinos in NYC.",

Johnny Depp is stellar, Joel Edgerton is fantastic, while the rest of the cast highlighted by Benedict Cumberbatch, Dakota Johnson, Jesse Plemons, David Harbour, Peter Sarsgard, Rory Cochrane, Adam Scott, Brad Carter, and Juno Temple, are all also great in the film. Truly, no one does a bad job, but those are just the ones who stood out to me the most. Yeah sure, I named most of the cast. Sue me. The film's writing is also very good and it does a great job telling the story of Whitey Bulger and shows his multiple sides; the friend, the father, the husband, and the ruthless killer. Great at capturing the visceral terror inspired by Bulger and the sense of fear surrounding him like  a black cloud, the film does a great job capturing the atmosphere needed. Another major strength of the film is the makeup. Both Depp and Plemons' transformations stand out the most, but they are truly remarkable and unrecognizable in their roles, while becoming their character looks-wise (and acting-wise). Finally, the costume design was also very good and looked the part. Overall, Black Mass is a very good gangster biopic. There are far better gangster flicks and far better biopics, but not many films have such a fantastic cast from top to bottom that knock all of their roles out of the park.",

Mass proves to be a solid movie, with a strong cast, excellent atmosphere and gut cringing violence, but the real surprise is Depp. He moves the movie frame by frame with a powerhouse performance that cannot be described in words. He puts all the swag he has on screen, and that also with real \"jolt\". Dakota Johnson as Bulger's wife, Lindsey Cyr, did a decent job post Fifty Shades age. Cumberbatch was good, but I felt like his character didn't have much to do with the main plot, nonetheless he was a fine addition. Joel Edgerton was good as well, with an electric scene in which it is definatley Edgerton's show. But the film, although being solidly paced and amazing all around, has some issues. Cooper's vision is uneasy and crinkled, he doesn't seen to express Bulger and his mob, the scenes are passes off with unnecessary violence and killings. Depp falls under this bad characterization of Whitey, and that could reflect him if other critics want to consider the film for Oscars. But, anyways! Johnny Depp deserves an Oscar.

Brando's GODFATHER was so a 70's folk icon. Even Pacino's SCARFACE evoked a awkward love from the audience. Now comes Johnny Depp's portrayal of real life mobster James \"Whitey\" Bulger in the movie BLACK MASS, and we see the visceral, brutal side of what gangsters really do. There's no cheering for Bulger from the audience. Deep's portrayal is cold, calculating, and relentless in his brutal vengeance against his enemies. What is remarkable about the story is how the locals in South Boston DID consider him a folk hero, and spoke of his time in prison like a boy scout merit badge. BLACK MASS is dark, unsettling, fascinating and honest. When you leave the theatre you won't be quoting \"I'll make him an offer he can't refuse\" or \"Say hello to my little friend\". But you will have been impacted by the brutality of a Boston mobster, and Depp has him down cold.",

The story is told through the confessions of members of Bulger's crew in prison right from the beginning, this allows the audience to see the whole story of Whitey Bulgers rise from an inside persepective. It's hard to believe this is a true story, but it seems to check out overall and keep to the facts for the most part. The casting is eerily spot on for some of the characters, adding to , Depp for instance not only looks like Bulger, he completely becomes the murdering sociopathic gangster with high aspirations. Notions of persepective and loyalty are played with through the horrors through this movie, I was riveted for the full 2 hours as it played out. An absolute must see.",

Meanwhile it helps his own gang and they take control of whole city. All of the middle of the movie is about him being intimidating and killing someone for different reasons, until FBI top guys understand what has happened and eventually catch everyone and put them in jail, including the guy from FBI. Ok, the story matches stories from other movies which isn't that shocking and as it was based on real life events, as I understand, then it's ok, but they should have at least made the middle a bit more interesting and different.
