Ex Machina has great acting from Issac and Gleeson but Vikander steals the show as Ava. All in all, it's a must see film that is very innovative and thoughtful despite pacing flaws.",

What Ex Machina has done is create a new way of making movies, a better way then \"the good ol' days\". Between the entrancing performances, the eerie forest retreat and the physcological horror that makes you question your own existence, this movie has made history and launched us into a new age of filmmaking, helmed so far by Alex Garland, the debut director of Ex Machina. The film bottled up so much feeling and suspense that it was  hard to comprehend, a strength lacked by Blomkamp's Chappie. The simple truth is that Ex Machina is an honest movie, and although it isn't the better than classics like Pulp Fiction and Citizen Kane, it is perfect for what it is.",

To make an entire movie about containing AI, and to have such such obvious security flaws made any AI escape feel intentional.  It's kind of like making Jurrassic Park and the main characters simply sympathetically open the door for the dinosaurs.  It insulted the audience by making the protagonist out to be an unbelievably dumb character who you don't want to follow.  Moreover, the pacing was pure ****  Tons could have been cut better.  Absolutely awesome photography, though (see: Under the Skin for pacing of this style done right).  The android was well acted and there were a number of applause-worthy acting scenes scattered throughout a series of increasingly stupid paths that the main character took the audience down.  By about halfway through the movie, after the main character was clearly compromised, the movie had a hard time evoking that earlier emotion from me, however.  Ultimately, even the secondary character (the boss) became unbelievably stupid to me by not having a means of healing or defending himself or building in a way to summon help.  Perhaps another way to interpret the movie is that the boss intended for a natural bar for his creation set both at the level of manipulation using another human to escape AND at the \"sufficient\" sophistitcation necessary for launch, and that his seed was sewn inherently upon death by this creation.  But the movie poster (\"what will happen if I fail your test?\", indicating sympathy toward the robot) and choice of perspective in the movie (the stupid cog in the wheel) indicates that this isn't the intended point of view.  And even if the latter interpretation were intended, it's still only a slight revelation to imagine that the event was precisely calculated -- but again, I feel like the chosen perspective, and reaction by the \"boss\" precludes this interpretation.  One good thing: At least it didn't sully any *actual* grand ideas for sci-fi or storytelling and the movie built a lot of hype for good sci-fi (for some reason).",

      "text": "Ex Machina is a story of this massively intelligent computer geek played by Domnhall Gleeson, who wins this huge award at a competition, and as a reward gets to spend a week in the mansion of the inventor of the this world's generic version of google, Oscar Isaac. For years Isaac has been building this super attractive female A.I, and now he wants Domnhall to put this A.I under various tests to see if they have actually created A.I. On paper the opening act of this movie sounds completely laborious, but it still manages to compel with it's exceptionally well written dialogue which works absurdly well with acting strengths of the 3 main characters. We see from the get go how smart both Domnhall and Isaac really are. It's clear they have found a niche in intellectual dialogue, as every line was delivered as if they fully understood the subject at hand, and their personal chemistry and perplexing sense of humour is down right fascinating. Then we have Alicia Vikander, who plays the A.I. And I can already tell she's already got a long career ahead of her. The way she can be so stiff and robotic yet act purposefully to the contextual drama is beyond me, yet some how she manages to pull it off. I think this movie has kick started the career's of 3 top notch actors. However, it's really the 2nd and the 3rd act that bring this movie up. As the A.I starts reacting to tests in extremely scary ways, conflict and tension grows between the 3 protagonists. But what really brings this aspect to life, is again the superb dialogue. It's worded so cleverly that it's hard to tell any ones true meaning, even in the most simple of lines. It constantly makes you re think who you should really trust with every line spoken. One minute your trust lies in the A.I, but then with another line of dialogue it changes to Isaac, creating nail bitting levels of tension. Despite this, there is one major draw back to this movie. While the dialogue is so complex with several layers of meaning in each and every line, the overall narrative is extremely cliched and goes for the pretentious examination of humanity plot line, resulting in the 3rd act suffering. A lot. However, this is still an excellently rounded and masterfully crafted movie, and a highly recommend watch.",

That\u2019s great too, we love your expressions and non-expressions; they are very expressive. Vaguely familiar nerdy white kid, you are also good at your job. Isaac oozes tension from the first minute he takes the stage. His presence shrinks the halls into jagged chutes to oblivion. There\u2019s a great cat-and-mouse story in here, but it feels like it\u2019s written at the scale of a decent Black Mirror episode, what extends beyond that is really just style and cool attitude that you can take or leave depending on how superficial you\u2019re feeling. The ending is a copout. It\u2019s one of those endings popular now with movies that do get lost in style, where it\u2019s not about making narrative sense but rather upholding a mood. Is the AI dumb or is the writer dumb? You can pick, but either way it\u2019s not as interesting as the character the movie seemed to be building up to or a fair attempt at examining the development of mind in an abusive home, a concept that is great and inevitably visioned in the formation of AI. I\u2019d love to see the Nicholas Winding Refn version of this movie. I feel like he knows how to balance cool and the contemporary urge to make everything mildly dissatisfying.

As for dramatic features, the plot is a fresh hybrid of two very familiar stories: (1) a wealthy oddball brings an innocent to an isolated lair for perverse games; and (2) a robot gets too big for its britches. Characterization is less robust; we don\u2019t get much sense of why the protagonists (human OR synthetic) act as they do, except in gestural shorthand or \u201chere\u2019s what I gleaned from your browsing history\u201d summary.

It quickly becomes obvious that there are more elements at play, between how the AI has been developed, How smart it really is and even it's creators intentions with the AI.All the actors in this movie also did fantastic jobs and the Director/Writer as well,in witch it was his first film. Ex Machina covers some extremely interesting and deep subjects when it comes to AI, Subjects that could easily be prevalent in are future. Without giving away to much of this movie all I can really say is that if you like the concept of Artificial intelligence and interested in what that could mean for are future I'm sure you'll find this film quite interesting.",

Once Caleb arrives at Nathan\u2019s home (in some remote location), he is eager to get started.  Once in the house, Caleb discovers why he is really there, to help test an AI (Artificial Intelligence). This is when we meet our third main character Ava (Alicia Vikander) a robot in the form of a female. Once we meet the character Ava, the film\u2019s intensity continues to elevate. While Caleb\u2019s task is to test Ava, he ends up with feelings for her. This storyline is intriguing, unique, makes for a great thriller, and thought provoking film.

We have seen it all before, one way or another. It had the chance to take us to a different place, but it settled for the conventional ending rather than the thoughtful. I think \"Ex Machina\" is still worth seeing. It is at its best when Alicia Vikander is on the screen. I would like to see them follow up with the story.

There was a small indie movie, which came out a year earlier called Automata, which explores AI in a way we haven't seen before.

These two are dark movies, but Ex Machina is a bit more terrifying, especially at the end.",

Perfectly casted, exquisitely acted, and Alex Garland deserved the Oscar far and away before the writer(s) of Spotlight for best original screenplay. I mean, honestly, Spotlight was a great movie, but the story was written for them in the 300+ articles done by the Boston Globe on sexual abuse in the Catholic church. What was so original about the screenplay? Ex Machina took a relatively new idea (Artificial Intelligence) and expanded it into the realm of possibility in today's world. It also posed so many questions about the ethics behind creating AI that it left you thinking about the possible gains and repercussions to actually stepping over that line for weeks after you'd seen the film. Low budget perfection.",
