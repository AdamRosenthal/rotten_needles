Early on, a behind-the-scenes glimpse at the online gaming industry is captivating but the film never commits to maintaining the insight as the larger crime narrative locks into place. Throughout the film, Thurman attempts to remind viewers that Runner Runner is about gambling through heavy-handed metaphors and exposition that explain the connections between high-stakes poker and high-roller living but none of these ideas come full circle by the end  as the story locks into a standard cat and mouse chase. As a result, gambling enthusiasts will likely conclude that Runner Runner is a shallow, and outright superficial, look at their hobby/business while anyone hoping for a sharp-witted look behind-the-scenes will find the film prioritizes generic story beats over innovative drama. Solid performances hint that, somewhere along the line, Thurman lost sight of any captivating hooks in his gambling thriller  instead delivering a bland and familiar narrative that, given the on-the-nose messages about striving for greatness, ironically, takes very few risks.",

Runner, Runner has a list of great cast like Gemma Atkinson and Anthony Mackie, but there's nothing new in the movie. I feel very disappointed at Justin Timberlake's movie career status because he's not yet a full Hollywood A-lister and just like Taylor Kirsch and Colin Farrell and even Ryan Reynolds, he's just not making a name for himself when it comes to becoming a musician turned actor. Affleck's performance in Runner Runner is lesser than Gigli and more than Argo. But I think he took a few steps backwards before he even got nominated for his work in Argo. It was supposed to be a good thriller, but then again I just might go see \"Gravity\" instead. I think I should wait for a rental, but I don't wanna see Runner Runner right now. If you like poker movies, try \"Leaving Las Vegas\" or \"Casino Royale\" and maybe you're just in time to play the cards right.",

      "text": "Occasionally bad or more appropriately named \"convenient writing\" aside, Runner Runner is simplistic hollywood entertainment. It never aspires to be anything super exceptional and it certainly doesn't dissappoint. It's weaker than 21, a somewhat similar movie but it offers up enough enjoyment to make it worth seeing. The trailers spoiled some of the plot and i think this is the kind of movie that would be more enjoyable if you went in knowing nothing about it. A lot of the f-bomb dropping seems unnecessary. The acting is passable all around. It was interesting to see the soon to be Batman in a villain sort of role. I wouldn't say he did a great job as Ivan Block but I also wouldn't say he did a terrible job either. The romance side plot between Gemma and Justin is laughable at best. Gemma's character in general seems very token, much like every other side character. Justin Timberlake did fine. I've never felt like he was a bad actor so maybe that's why I'm ok with his performance. Some of the twists near the end were good, but there were also some things that happened that were kinda iffy near the end as well. Really it's as I said before, it's good entertaining movie, and absolutely nothing more. Not one single aspect about it is exceptional and only a couple things are bad about it. Ultimately, it's a movie that knows it needs to entertain, something many much higher profile movies tend to forget.",

He was in a negative role in the movie but for me he looked more like a chocolate boy who is ready to romance than vicious villain. I liked his acting but not as a villain. I am not doubting his capable of performance but I felt the character should have been replaced with another actor. Then the movie would have been in a different position than now.",

      "text": "I never used to understand what critics meant when they said that a movie \"never quite knows what it is\", then I watched Runner Runner. Justin Timberlake, yes he does acting now, stars as the sort of main Richie Furst who leaves college to become part of Ben Afflecks business (Batman Industries). While Affleck compensates for pretty much every other performance in the movie. Timberlake just makes them look a lot better. It's not that he can't act he just  actually he can't act it's as simple as that. Gemma Arterton plays the girlfriend of every male character in the movie, and is obviously still trying to recover from St Trinians 2, but does it well. With the exception of the slightly intriguing premise (which probably looked good on paper) that is the only positive thing about Runner Runner. Everything else mainly the plot is very easily forgettable or all over the place or both. It goes from drama to thriller to romance to drama to action to crime and back to romance, that's only the first 10 minutes. I would explain how varied the whole movie is but I can't remember more than 20 minutes of the 100 minute runtime. However I can recall being slightly entertained or at least not bored. Which was actually quite surprising because there was not one explosion, a rare thing to see in any movie nowadays. Actually I'm not 100% sure there were no explosions because it was so easily forgettable. Undoubtedly not worth watching.",

Ben Affleck acted great although that did not help the movie it self. Overall this movie is about a college student who got scammed on internet gambling and tracks down the guy who owns the site (Affeck) then he hires him to work online for him then the rest of the movie gets very stupid and terrible the end.",
