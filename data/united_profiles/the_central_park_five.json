      "text": "I was fortunate to screen this heartbreaking film with one of the directors and two of the CP 5 - three really excellent people.  In lieu of writing a full review, I'd just like to urge everyone who reads this to say only one when when placed into custody - \"lawyer.\"  By doing so, it's not like pleading the 5th - no fact-finder or judge is going to presume you're guilty of anything.  These kids were absolutely bullied, but we can't assume that our government is run by angels, as Alexis de Tocqueville suggested - we have to protect ourselves.  So if you feel you've been wrongly detained - don't say more than that single word - lawyer - until you've had a chance to discuss your situation with your legal representative, whether he or she is someone you or your family finds, or the court appoints to you. This is NOT the same as not cooperating with a police investigation when you're not in custody.  But when YOUR freedom is at stake, don't hang yourself with your own words.  The admissions by these boys - which were coerced - overwhelmed the jury and directly led to their jail sentences.  I'm so sorry it happened that way.  Again, when you're Mirandized, listen to the words, close your mouth, and ask for a lawyer.",

The prosecutors - who have built careers on these cases - should truly be ashamed of themselves for not pursuing some very obvious exculpatory evidence and for not questioning the \"bad facts\" that they were confronted with.  Hopefully the city and state of NY will be writing some fairly sizable checks to these men in the coming years once the civil case is wrapped up. There has to be a punitive element to such bad behavior.",

The documentary details a nightmare scenario for five Harlem teenagers facing hard time, and the condemnation of America for a crime they didn't commit. The production sets the situation immediately, introducing the viewer to NYC in the 1980s, where Wall Street is in the process of rebuilding its reputation, while crack ravages the inner city, creating an explosive racial divide.",

      "text": "Central Park Five is documentary based on the true story about a case of rape and assault that occurred in Central Park, New York city.  It shows how the police investigation was not completed correctly and how five boys were falsely convicted and sentenced to time in prison. The boys were interviewed and talk about what they went through and how badly they were treated, NYPD was asked to comment and or talk about the case but there was no comment. The fact that the police department had no comment shows that even they knew that the situation was not dealt with in the right way. The documentary does a very good job portraying the time period and what it was like to live in New York during the 1980\u2019s and how racism affected the city. The film is not just an informative movie about the case; it goes into in depth problems that were very prominent during that time and still continue today. It discusses how racism was a contributing factor to the conviction of the boys",

These boys suffered an injustice that could easily be experienced in 2015. In the news we hear of places like Ferguson and present day New York. We hear of police overstepping their bounds when it comes to interrogating. We hear of police brutality. There are those who say when you raise these issues you are speaking against the very same people who are there to protect you. That is far from the truth. Anybody who speaks out against these abuses are merely against those who are overstepping their authority. The vast majority of police are heroes. The vast majority of police are people we should be looking up to.",

      "text": "This film is incredibly amazing. It was well filmed and made. One thing that really grabbed me into this film was the one-to-one interview sessions with five suspects. From hearing them talking about their experiences of being bullied by the NYPD to seeing their actual emotions through the screens was unforgettable. However, the stories that were shared by these five innocent men saddened me. I was very disappointed about the justice system in our country and I didn\u2019t like about the fact that they were unfortunate to spend their entire youth in the jail for an incident that was not associated with them at all. Besides being frighten and mad about this case, I have grown a strong feeling about protecting our rights. If this case were happened in today\u2019s society, I cannot guarantee if the consequences are going to be the same because there are so many controversial subjects that are tightly related to subjects such as racism, gender discrimination or just human rights in general. Personally, I believe the importance of educating young adults about how to stand up against for themselves because a lot of them might not be awarded that sometimes they have the rights to say No and speak up about the truth even when they are under the investigation. These five kids were innocently being bullied by the entire policy department, if it weren\u2019t for other purposes, they would not end up in jail. Thus, we have to be educated enough to know about our rights and how to use them to protect ourselves from being in situations like this.",
