Blu, a rare type of Macaw who has never learned how to fly, must embark on the adventure of his lifetime with the strong, independent Jewl, a female Macaw of his kind; both around and in the city of Rio De Janierio, Brazil. The film both figuratively, and literally soars with great moments for many of the characters featured within this movie. The heart of this movie is that there's a strong message, that by believing in yourself, there's almost no limit to what you can achieve. I loved this movie in theaters, and I can't wait to see it on Blu-Ray, literally! I highly recommend it for the entire family to see and enjoy! Enough said!",

They come in different colors, but fly, dance, speak, and behave the same. Had the producers done more research or cared enough, they could have fit fun facts of these species better into their roles and plot. Kids came away from Nemo being fascinated by diverse deep sea wildlife; on the other hand, replace the birds with cats in Rio and we still have the same movie.",

This is a very colorful, highly energetic film.  The filmmakers make a mistake that many current animated films make, however, they rely almost entirely on the visuals for the humor.  I saw this in a theater filled with kids and many were restless and not paying attention (unlike most Pixar films where kids are totally into it).  This film needed more HUMOR, and I'm talking about humor coming from the written word.  The music throughout was good and energetic.  I believe this was made by the \"Ice Age\" studio, as a \"Scrat\" cartoon was shown at the start.  I'm not a big fan of the Ice Age movies either because of the lack of humor (although the first one was pretty good).  Please hire better script writers.",

While its story isn't that bad, it is somehow a little wasted from its complete use of comic relief characters (I mean, a dancing bird with a had. Seriously). The love story between birds aren't that bad and the story to bring them together because of science is rather an interesting concept, except to the fact that the story revolving around that concept isn't too well executed. It would have been interesting if \"Pixar's Newt\" came out to compare with this film, but unfortunately Newt was cancelled with concern of this film. \"Rio\" is fine, but could have dropped all the pop culture references and the comic relief characters, to have become much better.",
