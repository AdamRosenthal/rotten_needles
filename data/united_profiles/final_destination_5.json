Even though you have probably heard of this movie long, long ago, and even though you have probably seen one or two of its sequels, Final Destination as a movie franchise has always found a way to bring new viewers into theaters. I saw the trailer for the latest installation, and I was hooked. Is it the lure of death that calls to us? Are we morbid for watching movies like this? Perhaps. But any way you slice it, Final Destination 5 is an adrenalin ride from start to finish. The acting is passable - even laughable at times, and the character development is strictly B movie, but man, oh man, what a B movie. Some of the set pieces are actually pretty compelling - just when you think you know what's going to happen - *WHAMMO!* *SLICE!* *GROAN* Another victim of death is served up on a platter for all to see. There are plenty of \"Oh My God\" moments in this otherwise predictable movie, and the squeamish will indeed look away - a lot - during the kill scenes. This movie is meant to be fun, and it is fun. The plot is rather silly and contrived, and - let's face it - just an excuse to get to the killing. If you liked Nicholas D'Agosto in \"Fired Up\", then you'll love him in Final Destination 5. Nicholas plays it straight as Sam, and he even has a love interest, but you know what happens to EVERYONE sooner or later - they all die! The hook or deus ex machina for FD 5 is the clever way the characters try to cheat death - again. For a fleeting moment, even the audience is convinced it will work... But if it did, we would not have much of a movie! The deaths keep coming right up to the movie's end. Speaking of the end, could this be the end of the series? During the final scene, as a young man is escorted screaming from an airplane, my buddy shouted, \"It's a prequel!\" Sure enough, as the credits rolled, the entire series was flash-forwarded in gruesome scene after gruesome scene. The end... for now.",

That's why I was such a big fan of Final Destination 5. It's a shockingly good movie, and that's mainly because the characters are a touch above what you've come to expect from this series. The characters are likable, so you actually care about them and don't want them to get killed in these horrible ways. It's a shockingly simple difference between good and bad horror movies that so many films don't seem to understand. The deaths in this movie are really ingeniously tense, leaving the audience guessing where the death will come from and when they will happen. Other major positives for this film are the great score by Brian Tyler and the very smart and surprising twist ending. This is a strong revitalization for the series, and I hope it continues if they make anymore.",

      "text": "Final Destination 5 is quite a bit of a mixed bag. There are elements present that suggest that it should be a better movie than it actually is, but looking at each of the series' sequels, it's quite an accomplishment that this one manages to be as good as it is. The opening premonition (a bridge collapsing, if, for some reason, you don't already know) is easily the best sequence of any of the five Final Destinations. It's an amazing technological accomplishment that manages to create a palpable sense of dread; though you know the it's-only-a-premonition gotcha! is right around the corner, tension yields to pure fear as the bridge crumbles away in three dimensions. If you're an adrenaline junkie, this scene alone is well worth the admittedly bloated price of admission. The rest of the film doesn't live up to this sequence, but there are moments when the filmmakers know how to get under your skin, such as the well-advertised trapped-in-a-Lasik-chair and screw-on-a-balance-beam scenes. It's unlikely that you'll be able to guess the outcomes of the over-elaborate but still bizarrely jarring deathtraps the characters find themselves in. Much has been said about this entry's use of characterization, which, following every sequel, is understandable. Let's simply say that there *is* characterization. The characters are somewhat bland, but occasionally funny. The actors are all right, but wooden lines of dialogue (the ones that have been heard in each Final Destination film) still sound stilted. If nothing else, they convey full ranges of fear and terror, two emotions that likely won't serve them outside of the horror genre. The film includes some plot twists, but does little of interest with them; if you have seen the trailer, you know of one, and if you pay attention, the second one is frustratingly easy to guess. In the end, there's fun to be had here, but as a good number of the critic's reviews will tell you, you probably know whether you want to see Final Destination 5 or not. (A little forewarning to those who, like me, pick up on certain details: when the bridge collapses \"for real,\" it collapses differently than in the premonition, which would, theoretically, change the order the characters \"should\" have died. The filmmakers don't make any use of this, so don't expect any curveballs of that sort. You can probably just regard it as what looks like a very expensive continuity error.)",

      "text": "As the incoming waves ripple nearby, an exhausted knight, recumbently inacitve on a rock-laden shoreline, starts to question the legitimacy of the cross, so proudly embossed on his chain mail vest, as he stares vacantly at god's kingdom, where from his vantage point on the primordial beach, sees only clouds and sky, and an eagle traversing across a gutted sky, recently secularized by the knives of devotional uncertainty. Next, he washes his face in the ocean, violently shaking off the **** from righteous hands which killed in god's name; red-stained hands that are guilty of spilling Muslim blood across a European battlefield. If Antonius Block, the skeptical mounted soldier in Ingmar Bergman's \"The Seventh Seal\", had the gift of premonition to foresee his own demise, like Alex Browning from the original \"Final Destination\", would he have bowed out of the crusade, and encourage his squire Jons, already a full-blown infidel, to do so likewise? For the sake of argument, let's say that Antonius cheated his ill-fated outcome, prompting death to come for the knight, who deserted the ongoing clash, thereby messing with the Grim Reaper's wicked designs. Newly informed by the \"Final Destination\" films, Antonius gets cast in a new light when death pays the knight a visit, solving, for some, a long-standing question as to why the shrouded figure comes for the crusader now, having just survived the most perilous of situations, only to be sentenced, somewhat unfairly, during peacetime. Like the bridge that collapses in \"Final Destination 5\", the unsavory side of life goes on, with or without Sam and his co-workers, as was the case with the Ninth Crusade, which when filtered through \"Final Destination\" and its sequels, continued on without the knight and his squire's participation. Antonius doesn't seem at all surprised by his black company, conceding that this expropriation was long in the making. \"My flesh is afraid, but I am not,\" replies Antonius to death's question about his departure from the corporeal world, a blatant lie that directly addresses the disgraced knight's conflicting spirituality. Antonius, plagued with doubts about the existence of heaven, challenges the darkest adversary to a game of chess, in order to buy time for his devotional restoration, whose flagging conviction in god led to this crusader's resignation from the ranks of the soldiered brethren. For the knight, the visage on the witch's face, as the men prepare to burn the young girl at the stake, looks all-too-familiar. \"Her poor mind is making a discovery,\" observes the squire. Antonius knows. He has seen the \"emptiness\", on the battlefield. Interestingly enough, \"Final Destination 2\" proposes the same godless diegesis as \"The Seventh Seal\", when during the film's opening credits, a talk-show guest differentiates death from the devil as the unseen malevolent force that struck down the survivors of Flight 180. Instead of chess, in essence, these captive participants are playing hide and seek. Of note, Clear Waters hides out at a mental hospital(and not a church). Moreover, tropes innate to this horror series can be applied retroactively to the Bergman classic. For the time being, death skips Antonius, intervening on the knight's behalf by agreeing to the proposed chess match, so as a result, Skat dies instead, when the black-robed figure fells the tree he was hiding in. It's really no different from the case of Billy, who in the original, gets decapitated near the rails, after Alex pulls Carter out of his car, which he left lying across the railroad tracks, just before the collision which prompts the errant scrap metal toward their once-headed friend's direction. The theater director, who runs off with a blacksmith's wife during his troupe's performance in a small hamlet, was slated to die anyways. Death skips him(and the married woman) because of the squire's calming influence on the cuckolded artisan. Jons also saves a mute girl from being raped and murdered by a corrupt clergyman. However, as death and Antonius near the endgame to their chess match, the black figure says, \"No one escapes me,\", but Jof and Mia, Skat's actors, give it a go, even though, like the \"Final Destination\" films, wind signifies death's presence, as they flee by horse and carriage, thanks to the knight who, once again, meddles with the plan by creating a distraction with knocked-over chess pieces. (Alas, the wind will return.) True to his word, Antonius and his friends follow death up a hill to their final destination; their hands interlocked, like a chain. It was predestined, but the knight changed death's plan. Jof sees them from afar. The actor may have been lying about seeing the Virgin Mary, but not this. To the knight's disappointment, in death, he's probably not going to light up like Patrick Swayze in \"Ghost\". Antonius Block won't be meeting the gymnast, or any of the other eviscerated victims in heaven.",

      "text": "FD5 shows hope for the series. As the first four installments progressed, the series seemed to be getting dumber and dumber as it went on. Firstly, I really liked the bridge collapse of the opening scene. Very intense, very dramatic (though not very realistic; there should have been a huge amount of wind that made the bridge oscillate for a few minutes. Instead, we see a small gust and then nothing). Secondly, I like the idea of the twist that if you take a life, you get to live the years that person would have lived. It's a fresh new take on a concept that was really getting stale after the first four movies. However, there seem to be just as many things to complain about as there are to commend. Firstly, the movie continues the not-so-time-honored tradition of using gore just for the sake of showing it. Instead of calculating its usage more so that it has a better impact every time it is shown, the movie just tosses blood all over the place most of the time, and some deaths seem almost as stupid as those in The Final Destination (don't even get me started on that movie!), for example the death scenes in the gym and the spa, which seemed so ridiculous that I wondered if the movie was making some strange attempt at humor. Secondly and lastly, the movie seemed to go by really fast. Maybe this is just me, but it seemed like the movie had less in it in general then previous installments have. Maybe I just lost track of time or something, but when the movie ended I didn't feel as though I'd just sat through a feature length flick. Overall, I can say FD5 is better then previous installments, and appears to be a hopeful restart to a series in need of rejuvenating. Though some of the death scenes are just stupid, the opening bridge scene and the intriguing murder twist make this movie one that is definitely worth seeing if you're an FD fan (otherwise maybe not so much).",

      "text": "Eleven years ago Final Destination took horror fans in a fresh new direction. The film had gruesome death scenes (not nearly as bad as the later installments.) But fate -and whether one could escape its plan- was where the real intrigue lied. Final Destination 2 traded character development for sillier death scenes, but at least some were mildly possible and interesting. I had the foresight to avoid what i felt would be ridiculously bad films in the third and fourth installments of the franchise. Something told me this one would be different. The film is directed by James Cameron's understudy, David Quale; who admitted the last films didn't live up to the first two. Quale claims to have attempted to use what worked in the first films to construct his fifth installment. One would think at the very least this film would have made brilliant use of the 3D technology that was, of course, extraordinary in Avatar. Horror movies are possibly the best genre for 3D -because you're meant to be jumpy- but this film attempts to ease us in through credits that slowly come closer and closer to the audience, but it becomes rather boring. Moving forward, Quale decides to splatter our cool 3D shades with blood and guts rather than use the technology to scare us. Sure... the bridge scene was nice, but after that the film stumbles from poor dialogue to atrocious acting to fantastically unbelievable death scenes. I know there are those who will say I should have seen that coming. Maybe they're right, but the first film wasn't nearly as grotesque and was written much better. Even the second installment looks very believable in comparison. The deaths are way too much, I wanted to scream at the screen in my best Mortal Kombat voice \"finish him\" (already). We always get plenty of plausible ways for characters to meet their demise, but instead we see something like a character getting their head knocked off by the torso of a deer being propelled by a tornado. Who am I kidding? That would be much too interesting for this film. One or two scenes should have surprised us by taking one of the more obvious deaths. Sam and his friends are mostly played by relative newcomers, but along the way, we meet some nice characters. Tony Todd (Candyman) is back as the coroner. He actually has a few terrifically ominous lines. And David Koechner (The Office) plays his usual oblivious character well. As a fan of the original I did enjoy the plot twist, which does something that I can't remember ever being done before. In the end, this installment may have done what it set out to do; make a better movie than Final Destination 3 or The Final Destination (the fourth film which claimed to be the last.) If the filmmakers wished for anything more however, they should have spent as much time crafting dialogue and story as they did dreaming up 1,000 ways to die.",

All the death scenes looked predictable but then came across as unwilling to be what was expected, which results in being unrealistic. Obviously it's ludicris to use the word \"realism\" with a film about 'Death' stalking the characters, but you get my point! The formula is slightly changed in this 5th instalment by the added feature of 'how to evade Death' by murdering someone else - which is what the franchise needed, to be progressive. With a film like this, you're not going to worry about the acting (really hammed up in some places), but some of the action sequences - particularly the bridge collapse sequence - was really good. The use of 3D was quite effective as well, much better than the 4th film. And the whole film was much better than the 4th film in every way - the deaths were more gory, more imaginative (and more funny!) It's also great as a viewer to look in the background for hidden messages of what might come next or what has happened in previous films (like the plane and truck models in the office scenes - from films 1 and 2 respectively.) The ending (of which I guessed!!) will please fans of the franchise, seeing how the films overlaps. Overall, the film is not going to win any awards or be voted favourite film of the year, but it's a good popcorn flick, doesn't require too much strenuous attention to plot, and supplies laughs as well as the jumps!

Quale, being a second-unit director on Avatar, has some experience with 3-D and really impresses us. The characters, surprisingly, are more sympathetic. That being said, the story is still ridiculous (although there are humor with the bloody scenes in some places) and it's gross as hell.",

The death in this one were terrible and boring and extremely weak. Watch if you are a an of the series but watch in this order 3, 2, 4, 1, 5. The main reason we watch these films are for the deaths come on people the same film is basically the same just more clever deaths. Most clever deaths to me occured in The Final Destination but Final Destination 3 was written better. I do say watch but expect nothing amazing. 5-6",

Death can only take on the tenor of a joke if we are overexposed to it. The film makes it a laugh to see someone get molten tar poured all over their head. Wouldn't be so funny in real life though. The film has you wondering what will happen next. The only thing I don't like is anything to do with eyeballs. Got that to-unfortunately. Gots that and stuff with tiny needles, large metal tools as well as entire cars coming down on peoples heads. Gimme some popcorn I think I love this movie.",
