There is no action and there is very little gore, its not a horror as such. Now my personal opinion. Lots of new going on in this film, i normally don't like Drama's but i am glad i gave this one a go. Acting is brilliant, the story is brilliant but slow, it's atmosphere paced and very touching. Very different take on a zombie apocalypse. Arnold's acting was brilliant and very surprising, Not massive dialogues, but enough, with the expressions and portrayal, Arnold did well. Everyone else in this movie also made it happen, nothing was flawed and it all came together well. Now it is slow and i was tempted to skip forward here and there but i stuck with it until the end and i am glad i did. It leaves a mark on you. Go into this movie expecting only a drama based in the zombie world and a whole new side to Arnold and you will appreciate it. Once again Drama's not my thing and Arnold's usual work is more to my taste, but i appreciated everything in this film, so on that perspective, il give it a 8.5/10. Its a shame people have not judged the film correctly. Nearly all Negative reviews say \"Bah where's the gore\", \"bah no action\" or \"Bah i hate Arnie\". If you see reviews involving anything similar to that... they have not watched it knowing what they were about to watch or are bigoted.",
