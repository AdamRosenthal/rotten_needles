      "text": "Jaden Smith's first star vehicle The Karate Kid (the movie was sold out since the 11:15am show when I saw it) and....wow. I was truly impressed as I only went in with modest expectations. Not only was it a very good remake, it's the best movie so far this summer, and it stands on it's own two feet and surpasses the original in a lot of ways (which one is better will probably be generational. From the standing ovation these kids at the theater I attended gave this film I'm pretty sure from 15 or so on down, it will be this one.) But first off, let me start by saying this: To anyone who doubts that Jaden Smith can act (which he ironically already proved in The Pursuit of Happyness), is a star, or deserved this movie: See The Karate Kid. I don't care how you see it. Pirated. Bootleg. Or the old fashion way (like I saw it cause I'm cool like that) by buying a frickin' ticket and sitting in an auditorium with a bunch of cheering 10 year olds (I swear I've never seen kids give a movie a damn near standing ovation like they did during this film's finale). Jaden Smith has just silenced his haters. From here on out, if you don't like Jaden Smith: fine. Whatever petty reason you've given yourself to make you not like an innocent 10 year old. Fine. But you can't say he's not talented. Cause he is. If nothing has proven it to you before, THIS will. He carries the film on his little shoulders, shows leading man qualities (has a 10 year old ever done that?!?!? And Im being serious here). Has a ten year old ever acted in a film and not only carried it but possessed the charm, charisma, quick wit, comedic timing, dramatic presence and physicality of a hero all in the same movie?!?!? I shutter to think, I couldn't think of any leaving the theater. If they have, please point them out to me so I can say bravo to them to. His performance was truly great and the fact that he did all of his own stunts and clearly learned kung fu and looks not only believable but in command of the craft is some sort of a mini-miracle. This little dude is miniature Will Smith of the highest caliber. He WILL be a star (pun, intended). Only thing can stop that is, well, him. Barring any personal issues, the kid will go far. Very far. He has it all. And as cliche as it may sound the biggest development to come out of the Karate Kid is that \"A Star is Born\". Don't believe me: watch it for yourself. But I digress, I only spent so much time on the Jaden issue because all the unwarranted hatred thrown his way is beyond disturbing. I have never seen such vitriolic speech directed towards a kid in my life. Not even the kid from Problem Child and he was a certified a-hole! But anyway, the movie is good. Jackie Chan was surprisingly really good (and I mean really really good like Oscar-nominee good) in a dramatic turn as Dre Parker's mentor. The action was better than the original's and the heart and soul was just as engaging and entertaining. Though lacking the iconic \"wax on, wax off\"-moment what they do with \"jacket on, jacket off\" was truly surprising and pretty good stuff when you realize what Mr. Han was really teaching him. Instead of the \"Crane Kick\" we do have another pose and it's pretty damn good too. To me, the original will always be special. I remember Daniel-son, and Mr. Miyagi is a fuggin' legend in every sense of the word. I'm actually utterly surprised this remake was so well made and engaging. Even though every one in the theater knew the outcome, everyone was still cheering and/or elated and moved by the movies \"big moments\". That in itself is pretty impressive. It's like if people were still surprised even though they knew who the killer(s) were in Scream 4 before seeing it. Could you imagine that? Yea, I couldn't either. Which is why I'm surprised at how good this remake was.",

So I was not too ecstatic watching it except for the fact Jackie Chan was in it, someone who actually has knowledge of martial arts. The film does an adequate job in recreating the \"classic\" film with its somewhat altered story of the cliched \"boy gets girl\" and \"boy gets revenge.\" But what makes this film from being a good movie is the age of the characters.  While I am not saying Jaden Smith, son of Will Smith, is an unsuited actor, but the age of the children is too young to be effective.  Is a 10 year old vengeance really valid, or is it just an act of impulse?  What made the original movie lovable was that the audience connected with the main character and ended up rooting for him. It is kind of difficult when the person you are cheering for is fighting for simply a frivolous rivalry.",

She often has no idea where he is, letting him wander around on his own and get in trouble in a new country they know nothing about.  She  is oblivous to his problems for much of the movie and spends the final act cheering as her young son is kicked and punched in mortal combat while other kids are getting beat senseless.  She manages to look hesitant after he is seriously injured and then continues to fight, but shows no sign of objecting.

      "text": "Finally and at least for me, thiz is the best Jackie Chan acting of all time, especially in Hollywood movies. Commonly, he always performed comical elements into his characters. But on thiz one, he turned successfully into deep and serious character. I think Jackie also realize he cannot depend on his martial arts forever (since SHINJUKU INCIDENT (2009)), considering his age which is 56 thiz year. Yes, it is still using the same formula. It is what we saw on THE KARATE KID quadrilogy (1984-1994). In the other hand, the Casts are amazing, to put Will Smith son, Jaden Smith to become the disciple and Jackie Chan as the master. It is spectacularly ingenious combination. Beside of that, the setting in China was exotic and wonderful. They kept the famous title, but actually it is all about Kung Fu. I did not understand why most of critics underestimated thiz movie. What I observe, everything is already maximized. The plot was the same, but the atmosphere was renew and absolutely refreshing. The movie is not just fills with great action scenes but also thoughtful life philosophies inside. -Life will knock us down,.. But we can choose to get back up- is definitely will be one of the memorable quotes. It is not Jaden Smith best performance, but what amazed me is how his attitude and body language looks similar to his father on some moments. The scene stealers are two chinese kids around Dre character (Smith). First one is a girl who becomes Dre lovely friend, Meiying (Wenwen Han) and Cheng (Zhenwei Wang) as Dre furious foe who appears with firm performance. I will watch closely what development may comes to thiz potential young Action Actor in coming years. The film directed by Harald Zwart, The Dutch Director, nothing is special on him. In fact, many of his directing was corny and typical children movies, such as: AGENT CODY BANKS (2003) and THE PINK PANTHER 2 (2009). In thiz case, it is exactly what we need to make thiz new Karate Kid. In thiz movie, the story telling has detailed chronology. As a consequence, the film duration is practically a little bit long. But every scene, every character, and every action was fantastic. It wont bore us at all. Bcoz everything is Kung Fu!",

Can we really like the changes (wax to jacket, white kid to black kid, Pat Morita to Jackie Chan) and call it a standalone remake? Will Jackie Chan give a strong supporting role? Is Jaden Smith going to give a performance that'll mark his name in the Young Hollywood A-list? Will it show off fighting scenes that could match the original's?

It followed the skeleton of the movie from 1984 also, but in the end it never mattered a great deal.",
