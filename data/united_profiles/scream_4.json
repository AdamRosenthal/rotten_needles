The film rewrites the rules of the first trilogy, and one of the most evident changes comes in the opening scene, in which 2 characters, 1 male, 1 female are killed. This scene will be seen as either boring and long-winded, or completely genius; my belief being the latter. It excited me and shocked me, without ever leaving the viewer lost, and in it's last moments (while giving a violent nod to a famous death from the 1st film) becomes the most violent and aggressive pre-title scene from all 4 films. Following a couple of misleading \"jumps\" and a little exposition, with the original 3 survivors positions all being developed quickly and efficiently, it isn't long before the film delves into the \"who's next?\" pace. With the standard \"CiCi/Candy\" kill being presented, in this movie as a more intelligent, brutal killing (and a particularly active Sidney Prescott facing off with 'Ghostface'), the movie already feels very different to it's predecessors. The kills are creative, quick and in heavy supply, and the list of suspects is soon whittled down, leading to the most shocking, well-acted, and at times hilarious conclusion that leads the viewer asking \"When is Scream 5 coming out?\".",

It's a little cheesy and too self-referential for it's own good (which is the idea; although I'm not sure they intended to be as over-the-top as it is) - but it mostly knows how to maintain  the suspense, occasionally entertain and, heaven forbid, be a watchable movie.

The franchise is probably never going to equal the heights of the first installment again, but miraculously, it still remains a hugely enjoyable series. Wes Craven thankfully got the three main players back again (four if you count Roger L. Jackson). Neve Campbell's Sidney Prescott still makes a likeable protagonist (even if you wonder why, after all she's been through, she doesn't arm herself at all times) and David Arquette's Sherriff Dewey and Courtney Cox's Gale Weathers are still entertaining. The cast of young newcomers including Emma Roberts, Hayden Panettiere and Rory Culkin all serve their purpose, either by dying horribly or as potential Ghostface suspects. So it's business as usual in Wes Craven's Scream world, and while the plot's a little too predictable, some of the self-referential winks to the audience a little smug and annoying, and the run-time a bit lengthy, the film's energy and Kevin Willaimson's sharp script keeps you entertained throughout (bucket-loads of blood and some good jokes don't hurt either). So it's not as good as the original (something the film itself even amusingly points out at one point), but I struggle to think of many (if any) other fourth films in a franchise that are this decent, and that still have something to say. Horror films, after all, have evolved (or devolved, depending on your perspective) over the last decade, with handheld horror mockumentaries, torture-porn and the seemingly endless procession of remakes giving Craven an Williamson ample ammunition for affectionate parody. Scream 4 is a much more satisfying conclusion to the series than its underwhelming predecessor, but unfortunately, Hollywood being what it is, I doubt Ghostface is gone for good...",

      "text": "When it was first released in 1996, the original 'Scream' was an intelligent, and fun horror film that gave the slasher genre a big boost of much needed energy.  'Scream 2' was an entertaining sequel that cleverly built upon what the original film started.  'Scream 3', although not as bad as some people say, was admittedly a bit of a let down.  So after more than 10 years of horror films in between, we have 'Scream 4', ready to dissect and poke fun at recent horror films (and the state of the horror genre in general) once again, and it turns out, it's pretty good!  If you thought this series couldn't get any more self-aware, you were very, very wrong.  'Scream 4' is a hall of mirrors to the horror genre. It is arguable that this film is self-aware to a fault (with constant references not just to other horror movies, but to past 'Scream' films as well). And this time around the comedy is turned up a few notches, which does take away a bit from some of the bloodshed.  But, if taken with a small grain of salt, this can still be a fun movie. So enough about the cons, and onto the pros. Although not as good as 'Scream', 'Scream 4' is about on par with 'Scream 2', and is admittedly an improvement over 'Scream 3'.  For starters, it has a decent amount of fresh faces to liven things up (Hayden Penattiere and Rory Culkin are two standouts).  Like before, the characters in the film all speak with clever, self-aware dialogue.  There are also a few reasonably suspenseful set pieces, and the who will get it next/whodunit angle still works well enough to keep you guessing throughout the film.  If these movies are not your thing, I would be surprised if this one changed your mind.  But if you do enjoy the 'Scream' films for what they are (entertaining and suspenseful horror-comedies), then give 'Scream 4' a try.",

Well, the opening sequence, in trying to be spectacular, kind of falls flat and turns out to be the weakest opening yet. It tries to take a stab at the ridiculous franchises out there that seem to fall apart as a new installment hits but doesn't take itself seriously enough in the moment, thus rendering it more of a Scary Movie type spoof than an actual slasher flick shocker.

With no scares, and barely a few thrills (but 49 different plot twists to make up for it, unfortunately), Scream 4 just fails at being a horror and turns into a parody of itself and of the franchise it represents. Not remembering most of the previous Scream films, since I watched them a long time ago, I soon enough realised that there should not have been another Scream film in the first place. The desperation of the producers to get some more money out of the died franchise is obvious, when they are trying to \"re-invent\" the franchise through recycling old material but making it seem \"original\" and \"different.\" I ended up laughing at most of the film (I guess, at least it was entertaining in that regard), but also found myself palm-slapping myself a number of times because of how poor the screenplay was. It is basically a comedy and has nothing what a horror ought to have. It is a failed attempt to rejuvenate the franchise, which in my eyes, has utterly failed. Hopefully this will be the last of the Scream films.",

Craven directs it confidently, but couldn't he give it a little more style, or make it a little bit more of a spoof?  4 movies in I wish the series would stop trying to mix actual horror with the laughs.

Stick a fork in 1996 already.\" The dialogue is witty and acerbic the entire time and all feels fresh and modern, which in itself is a huge accomplishment. Characters are completely believable as teens and the acting is actually great, specifically Hayden Panettiere who plays my favorite character: a dry, sardonic and sexy closeted film geek. The brilliantly orchestrated final act discusses modern society's obsession with technology and easy-found fame and the identity of the killer surprised me to no end; even being a die hard fan of the franchise and a cinephile, I didn't guess anything correctly. There are SO many red herrings that make you contemplate if something is too obvious, who was doing what when, and makes you double check yourself in regards to reverse psychology of believing who the killer is. The best part is that all but one of the cliches and tropes that are utilized for satire are subverted and/or openly acknowledged. The script justifies a character's seemingly stupid actions or flips it outright. Everything is shot well with good use of lighting as well as a good orchestral score and the directing is good (pay attention to the increasing corniness of the opening scene). It's actually the best of the series, better than the first with very clever kills and witty satire regarding torture porn, found footage genre films, modern horror, remakes and reboots.

During a meeting, in which the rules for surviving a horror movie are being dissected, Charlie says, \"To be the new version, you know, 2.0? The killer should be filming the murders.\" With this heedless declaration, John McNaughton's \"Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer\", and more importantly, \"Man Bites Dog\"(the original meta-horror movie that meant serious business), goes unacknowledged, especially when Robbie puts in his own two cents, adding that \"it's the natural next step in psycho slasher innovation,\" as if the murderers in \"Scream 4\" are pioneering a new methodology in the killing business. Benoit Poelvoorde, playing \"himself\" in the 1992 Belgian production, is the subject of a documentary film that profiles the day-to-day travails of a serial killer. To paraphrase and co-opt Robbie's proclamation in its proper context, \"the psycho slasher innovation\" of \"Man Bites Dog\" is how the filmmaker shifts the focus away from the cult of personality surrounding the homicidal maniac and more towards the person he's putting under life-threatening duress, so that the moviegoer identifies with the inevitable victim and not some hillbilly with a chainsaw, or a knife-wielding goalie. Ben doesn't have the sex appeal of an anti-hero; he has no gimmick. With the cameras rolling, this no frills psychopath, at one point, suffocates a young boy in his own bed, the culmination of a home invasion gone awry. The hands that hold the pillow steady over the smothered child's face are ordinary hands, all-too-human ones, without the accoutrements of knives extending from the fingers. The vicarious thrill of harmless bloodlusting people get from watching people die is largely absent, made strange by the film's straight-faced mockumentary form, in which the horror is the end-result of a slaying, and not the creative spectacle(the incident that prompts the arterial spray and all manners of bloodletting) leading up to the latest casualty in Jason, Michael Myers, or Freddy Kreuger's killing spree. The content is self-reflexive. It confronts the moviegoer with this burning question: Why do we like to watch people die in grisly fashion for fun? The \"Stab\" franchise, the movie series within the movie series, is used in \"Scream 4\" to exemplify the fandom behind slasher flicks in the form of an impromptu film festival, a \"Stab\"-athon staged by Robbie and Charlie. Playing to a capacity crowd in a barn house, \"Stab\" open just like \"Scream\", but with one significant change in the film-within-the-film adaptation of  \"The Woodsboro Murders\", the Gail Weathers bestselling book that gives the \"real-life\" account of the Ghostface Killer , whose fictitious handiwork is transformed into non-fiction by \"Scream 2\". Heather Graham, playing the role of the girl who gets murdered at the outset of \"Scream\", disrobes in the bathroom, an outright deviation from \"actual\" events leading up to the crime. To us, the actual moviegoers, the nudity is implied, but to the \"Stab\" audience, the partygoers at the \"Stab\"-athon, the suggested nudity from their diegetical perspective is frontal, and gratuitous, since the character Drew Barrymore plays, never endeavors to shower, therefore deconstructing the slasher pic trope of topless nubiles, because the bathroom scene in \"Stab\" is indeed superfluous, which is proven by the put-upon historicity of the original \"Scream\". In \"Stab\", just like many slasher movies of its ilk, the young woman shows us her breasts, then sooner or later, she shows us her blood. \"Man Bites Dog\" knows the trope well, and is more blunt about the interconnectedness that binds sex and violence together in all its R-rated glory, by replacing the usual display of exhibitionism(or consensual sex) found in most dead teenager movies with gang-rape as the prelude to the woman being murdered. \"Man Bites Dog\" brings to the foreground the seeming disinterest in sex that is common to all the major figures in the annals of horror cinema. Like \"Man Bites Dog\", the killer has sex on the brain in \"Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer\", when Otis sexually assaults the woman that he and the titular character kills(along with her husband and son), and videotapes. These two seminal horror films are real in a way that \"Scream\" can never be, even with the advantage of the film-within-the-film device. As the Ghostface Killer records his attempted murder of Gail in the hayloft, the juxtaposition between the \"true story\" and \"based on a true story\" reveals nary a difference in form and content, especially since the homicidal videographer never shows his true face. He hides behind an iconic mask, a signifer of entertainment, purveyor of cinematic violence.",

While I applaud Scream 4 in originality (the old satirical humour is still very much alive) a lot of tension, for me at least, was lost to half arsed dialogue, lack of build up and a predictable structure. It just wasn't tense enough. I really didn't care about the new characters they brought to the franchise. In fact, the only reason Scream isn't getting a lower score is because I was nowhere near guessing the killers identity. That and I have a soft spot for slashers, a genre of horror films that has nearly dried up. And it was good to see ghostface.",

      "text": "So 11 years on after the 'SCREAM' franchise was seemingly brought to a close Wes Craven is back with a fourth instalment of the horror series with the return of the original protagonists as well as a new generation of characters. This time around its a \"new generation\" so \"new rules.\" As always theres a few cameos in the opening sequences and Scre4m is no different, and this one is actually a pleasant surprise. And this makes a returning Sidney Prescott a murder suspect as she is returning to Woodsboro on the anniversary of the orginal murders to promote her new book. Before long the Ghostface killer goes on the murder path and the bodycount rises. As a fan of the original trilogy I was concerned that Scream 4 was nother more than a cash stunt but im glad to say its not the case. It's true it's not the scariest film, far from it but it does have some great, typical Scream moments and surprising certain parts are genuinely funny. Without spoiling the ending all I can say is I was really satisfied with the finale to Scream 4 and completely bought the motives of the killer which I suppose was a bit of a surprise given the circumstances. If it is to be the start of a new series of films then the signs look pretty good because it is a promising start to a new trilogy. As always the performances of the original cast are ever reliable with Neve Campbell is good as always as the victimised Sydney, David Arquette is funny as Sheriff Duey and Courtney Cox is fantastic as the minipulative Gail Winters who is suffering from writers black and not to be forgotten Hayden Panettiere who is awesome as the sexy-horror geek Kirby! In conclusion Scream 4 is a promising start if it is to kickstart a new set of movies and it bodes well for future outings but it's nothing to to fans of the horror genre and newcomers might struggle to understand all the fuss as it does nothing to raise the bar but nonetheless is immensly enjoyable and a worthwile watch.",

It was really great having the main characters back and to delve back into the world of Sidney Prescott who is as stubborn as a mule, why won't she just die?! Nah, I jest, the tongue in cheek nature of these films alone is alone to set them above, say, Friday the 13th sequels which ultimately serve no purpose other than to kill off big titted women. Scream 4 has always featured familiar names getting killed off in simpler ways than, say, Freddy Kruger. The real-world, grounded nature of the human serial killer is a scarier notion than any ghost story so when these films go OTT like in Scream 3 and now 4, it ruins the film series. The original Scream still remains one of the scariest films because of the \"this could actually happen\" feeling which comes with a non-supernatural villain. Not that the villain in Scream 4 has any powers (Scream 3 certainly seemed to have whacky **** going on, dunno what but it's methods didn't make sense like in 2 or 1). Scream 4 was an attempt to fill the void left by Scream 3, bring the saga back into line whilst going off into a new, modern day horror comment. Unfortunately the lingering nature of Scream 3 stuck around therefore loses it a few points. As I said before, some familiar names here to get hacked off, and in true Scream tradition they're all from popular TV shows, which only makes the hacking more fun. Unfortunately the end twist was a little too predictable, however the very end, the last few lines were a clever nod to how we as society praise the good and the bad, even if we don't have all the facts. 7/10, I was hoping for a 9 at least.",

What else can they really do with it and what's left of the story to tell us that we don't already know? That was my thinking going into Scream 4, but when it comes to Wes Craven, you really never know what you're going to get. After pumping out three movies in four years, Craven took eleven years off before taking another crack at Scream, thinking why not make what's old new again, and it works! Scream 4 continues the legacy of the series by combining a classic slasher film with the technology and youth of today, who are still making a mockery of the whole situation. The screenwriting is absolutely genius, as is evident by the opening scene, which actually rivals the scene in the first film. In Scream 4, we see a grown up Sidney Prescott return home to Woodsboro a changed woman. She's there to promote her new book and catch up with her old friends, Sheriff Dewey and his wife Gail. They're all having a nice reunion, on what turns out to be the anniversary of the first killings, when all of a sudden things turn ugly again. You know the characters and you know the actors playing them. They're a little bit older, they're a little bit wiser, and they're every bit as energetic and interesting as they were in the first three films. The old school Woodsboro family meets the current Woodsboro family and what you get is something that's very similar, but oddly different. Scream 4 is witty, clever, and updated. Wes Craven was right, what was old is new again and it reminded me of just how much I loved the original films.",

SCREAM makes a surprising comeback after a decade away from the screen, teaming series creator Kevin Williamson with Wes Craven once more in what is easily the best sequel in the franchise. The new script is just as sharp as Ghostface's knife, never missing an opportunity to poke fun at modern Horror trends or the series, itself. Some of the greatest moments are achieved by exacerbating the concept of the metafilm to the point of lunacy, essentially creating a film about making a film about a film about films. The tagline promises a \"New Decade. New Rules.\" As we have come to find out from the previous films, the only New Rule is that SCREAM breaks all the rules. Plot contrivances aside, the film legitimately keeps the audience guessing until the very end, never knowing which cliche will be the next to suffer. Williamson has taken a clever approach to the remake as only the SCREAM films can, using the remake as an integral plot device towards something wholly original. While it is still as sappy and pretentious as each of the earlier entries, SCREAM 4 is equally entertaining for fans of the series. Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox, and David Arquette are each at home in their returning roles, and even the newcomers earn passing grades. One can only hope that the inevitable sequels continue to uphold the same level of intelligence and humor shown in this fourth film.",

I just watched the 3rd one yesterday and the 4th today.  I really liked the 2nd one when I watched it a month or so ago and as of yesterday thought it was the best one out of the three. This one however, takes the cake. It may not try to achieve any ground breaking concepts for the franchise or the horror genre but, it delivers where it counts. The writing and filming are even better in my opinion then for the other three films. People say it's not scary but the scenes are just different enough from film to film that I think anyone afraid of jumpy scenes will get plenty of shock value. I don't think that it's just more of the same. A \"Who Did It\" plot is always exciting no matter how many times it has been done, as long as it's done so well like in this movie. All that being said, I think if done correctly there could be two more successful movies for the franchise. That being good actors playing the right characters. A good story driven plot and some new twists and turns we all want and expect.",

The film does feel like it needs a lot more character development, but it is saved by the gory and sad deaths, memorable moments, opening kill, the killers' identity, their motive, and one particular line in the climax. Here's hoping that soon, a final sequel will be made to end the series properly.
