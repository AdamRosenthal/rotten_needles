The schemes of Jim, Oz, Kevin, Steve, and Finch get themselves into trouble, but it becomes clever when they get out of it. Steve Stifler is at his best, most clever, and funniest actions, the dialogue is well-added to reunification of the characters and occasionally funny, and the revival of the minor characters is surprisingly wonderful; Especially the Shermanator, Nadia, and John Cho who plays Harold in Harold & Kumar. And you know what, even with recyclements from the first, it is better than American Pie 2 and The Wedding in almost every way. Compared to those two, I think it is worth seeing for American Pie fans even though it is not on the same measurements as the first slice of Pie. Besides, along the way, it's hilarious, it's moments of reunification are engaging, and there's a lot of wild Adult-Teen fun. It also succeeds at regaining the pleasantness of the first two and is less gross than American Wedding. However, I'll be honest: It's immature seeing Jim, Kevin, Finch, Oz, and Stifler doing immature things in their 30s but it reminds why we liked them for doing immature things in the first, they're still there for each other, and it's nice to see every character reunited. In fact, it's so worth seeing you get to see your favorite characters do funny things you never get to see them do in the first three that is surprisingly entertaining, especially Jason Stifler's Mom meeting Jim's Dad but I won't give out a lot of spoilers. American Reunion is a reunion worth going to... SEE... FOR LAUGHS. And one thing is for sure: American Reunion is more hip than American Pie 2 and American Wedding.",

I was against them making another one of these films because they should've stopped after the second film but i decided to just see it anyways to test it out, and i pretty much just watched the trailer, just extended with a quite a bit of drama mixed in.

      "text": "\"American Reunion\" is sure to appease previous followers of the series; it's still laden with the expecting awkward sexual situations, crude prankishness from Stifler, unsettling talks between Jim and his dad, and plenty of booze. It follows the same formula.  And, as anticipated, being a \"reunion\" movie means one is bound to have a failed marriage, another is likely to question their career path, and one couple of old flames will get back together. It's all very routine, and brings reason and justification to its long-over-due end. 'Reunion' simply doesn't feel like anything new was ever thought of upon its creation; instead, it feels as if filmmakers studied the previous installments, added marriage and children into the mix, casted some new fill-ins, and changed little else. The film begins on a couple unsensibly tactless and unfunny notes, all while conspicuously focusing on Stifler to create laughs, and finally refines its crassness, albeit slightly, later. As I found myself watching 'Reunion', I couldn't help but notice the change in the degree of humor since its first installment; the gags are repeated, but aren't nearly as affecting as they once were. Also, the film's attempts to wring out as much sex from its \"reunion\" themes comes across as forced and desperate. One instance, in particular, shows Jim playing off the \"I remember you from somewhere...\" motif. He runs into a newly \"legal\" teenage girl who he used to baby-sit. Naturally, the film sees that she is topless, and ready for Jim to defile. Why a married man with a child, contemplating the seduction of an eighteen year old girl, who in fact he used to watch under his care...as a child, is material that is purported to bring about laughs is sickening to even consider. But, nevertheless, the audiences behind me cry out in riotous cacchination over its \"humor.\" The same idea is repeated all throughout the film, as Stifler is shown attempting to titillate the fancies of a group of stereotypical, obtuse-minded beach babes, making references to current-day pop culture. By this time, the deplorable pursuits at comedy are more than soaked up; no, its been dead for thirteen years. Ultimately, \"American Reunion\" is exactly what fans and newcomers, alike, expect from the latest installment; the former couldn't love it more, while newbies couldn't like it less. Without knowing the characters beforehand, the film is seen as another dumbed-down, sex-comedy featuring the disturbingly familiar motif of married men flirting with the concept of cheating on their spouses with teenage girls, and from that, expecting to generate laughs. Having seen the previous films, 'Reunion' doesn't even come close to matching the effect of its original or seconder, but does just what one expects in concluding a still classic title series; not laugh-out-loud, but still offering some comedic relief. As a late-night-filler-theater-trip-with-friends, the film fulfills its role--and likely its budget--with familiar faces and old, but nostalgic gags.",

Kevin's schtick was finished in the original film, and now he feels extraneous.  The women of the American series are uniformly forgettable; they're merely objects.  There's just no reason to care what happens to half the cast of this film, no sense of purpose like the original film had, or the feeling of a story being told.  None of which stops American Reunion from having a lot of laughs, big and small.  There are great lines and sight gags for every part and function of the human body.   Ultimately, American Reunion is nothing more than a situational comedy, built up of sketches.  On that level, the better part of it works.  Full review on my blog.",

There is a rivalry going on here between sentimentality and raunchiness (raunchiness ends up being the victor most of the time) that don't blend into a consistent tonal whole throughout and, despite these battling factors, 'American Reunion' ends up being rather dramatically lame and kind of unfunny. Seeing these characters act childish and horny might have been funny ten years ago, but watching them at the age of thirty, it's kind of sad. Jason Biggs and Sean William Scott seem willing enough to devote themselves to each crude bit, but the filmmakers are solely interested in having these grown men forced into embarrassing and juvenile situations in which soon after someone catches them in the act. The movie ends up repeating itself so maddeningly often in this fashion. Whatever attempts that are made to stitch on a believable plot attempt to be pushed into the corner by crudity.

I had hoped this would be a return to form, however what I saw was simply a husk of the characters  I grew up laughing at. The story follows the reunion of the full main cast (last together in American Pie 2), however whilst the cast is back the laughs sadly have not  returned for the most part. After a hilarious first scene the film never quite gets back to that level of humour that made the first two films great, instead focusing more on the fairly depressing story lines of the main 5 guys however character development is minimal so the pay off is small from this decision. I think the main problem is that this film tries to grow and stick to its roots at the same time. Also setting up for more films, that's not going to happen any time soon.",

Sean William Scott plays a jockey douche very well handled, everyone here plays their characters very well, they managed to stay the same even though their old. Writer-directors Jon Hurwitz, Hayden Schlossberg (Harold & Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay) take a crack at the franchise and made it all fun again, it has it problems such as at it times it can be funny I wished it could of had more character development and wanted to see more out of these love able character.
