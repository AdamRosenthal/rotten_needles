I really couldn't care what happened to these characters because I barely got to know them.  The plot is pencil-thin, and the ending is anti-climatic and not suspenseful at all - a HUGE wasted opportunity in what should have been the scariest part.

My biggest problem is that they spoil the movie with the teaser trailer and all I could say this is that why we're having a baby and a dog in the scene like this? People concern this teaser the whole time and it does sucked when the trailer shows the audience seeing the movie in green screen since last year. The characters are alright,but not much good as Katie and Micah does. I like the security cameras when they show the scene where the ghost is doing in six shots. It has some lame talking scenes that I didn't interested to hear,all we want is scaring,because we didn't care about the story. It does has the same setting as the the first one and it has the same dialogue too. But this one is the prequel,it tells the story where Katie meet the family and they got spooked in the house before the couple started taping the evidence. It did get scared in four moments with large sounds and it's quite silly in the movie,but I prefer the first one and this sequel is less than scary,not bad and it wasn't quite special.",

The first Paranormal Activity had suspense and the thought that this may actually be real.  Now everyone knows it's not real so instead of trying some new scares they just regurgitated the same \"scare\" moments of the first one (loud noises, slamming doors, shadows, people getting dragged).  I'm not saying that it didn't make me jump (the Kitchen scene in particular was scary $hit) but towards the end it seemed to jump the shark and become comical.  The last 20 minutes I just kept on thinking \"Are you for real?\"  I think the sequel had potential but it was just too poorly done for me to care.",

      "text": "It's not a mystery, scale-wise, commensurate to the Star Child's true identity, or the origins of the Monoliths, filmically cosmic mysteries that Peter Hyams clarified in his rightfully maligned \"2010: The Year That We Make Contact\"(the sequel to the Stanley Kubrick masterpiece), but it's still anti-climactic, regardless of the differentiation in pedigree, when the filmmaker literalizes the once heretofore unexplainable materialization of a burnt family photo in Micah Sloat's attic, and in the process, ruins the most enigmatic moment from \"Paranormal Activity\", the Oren Peli-directed original. So now we know, to the detriment of the original film's mythology, that among the moving things and unexplained noises in the Sloat household, there was, in retrospect, some normal activity, as well, some debunking, some collaboration with the unseen forces, in which man is shown to be capable of an evil far worse than any demon. Daniel(Brian Boland) orchestrates a transference, acting on his Latino housekeeper's instructions(not only do they clean houses, they clean souls, too), Kristi's husband sets a photo of Katie on fire, and is presumably the one who does the planting. Let the picture in the attic just be; let the Monoliths be. So now we know: both sisters married jerks. Daniel probably sleeps on the wrong side of the bed too, a coward, just like Micah, who in \"Paranormal Activity\", sleeps on the side farthest away from the doorway, so should a demon enter the bedroom, given the positioning on their bed, Katie looks like the brave one, since she's the first warm body that the poltergeist would encounter. Micah, by all appearances, uses Katie as bait, a means by which the amateur filmmaker can get the best-possible footage of their unwanted guest attacking his girlfriend. In \"Paranormal Activity 2\", it's the baby who takes the brunt of the supernatural malfeasance, with only a German Shephard, the family dog, standing sentry; a German Shephard who is no Lassie, since he fails to make his owners understand that they have a situation far worse than Timmy being stuck down some well. He doesn't bark loud and long enough. Too bad \"Paranormal Activity 2\" wasn't one of those talking animal films, if it was, the dog could tell his human owners to get the f*ck out, now. Speaking of talking dogs, what would Scooby-Doo say? Probably something along the lines of, \"Ruh-roh. The baby is sliding across the side of his crib. This is scarier than the Blair Witch twigs.\" Poor baby. Nobody thinks to check the playback on the surveillance footage that details the 'round-the-clock nursery going-ons, even though the family reviews the mystery of the gallivanting pool cleaner, and also the slamming door which locks Ali(Molly Ephraim) out. As is the case in all horror movies since time immemorial, the people are kept in harm's way due to the advice of the rational one, the singular hold-out to the new reality that defies reason, who ends up getting everybody killed, because of his(it's usually a guy) unbending stance against the mounting evidence which points to escape as being the most prudent course of action. In \"Paranormal Activity\", the couple stays because Micah wants to finish his movie. In the sequel, there is no such egocentric(Micah is willing to risk his girlfriend's life for his own selfish reasons), albeit intellectual basis for the family to remain as housemates with the devil. Daniel is just a tool. When it's too late, he turns to Martine(Vivis), the Hispanic maid he fires for being too superstitious. Ever the tool, with Kristi beset in a catatonic state(and in a biting mood), Daniel still gives his housekeeper static, as he protests in disbelief at having to use a cross for the purging. So now we know the pretext behind Katie's true identity, and just like the Star Child, our understanding of the circumstances that made them who they are, while may be interesting in a cursory way, a gimmick to drive each respective sequel, it threatens the purity of both \"2001: A Space Odyssey, and to a lesser, but proportionate degree, \"Paranormal Activity\", as well.",

Of the 90 minutes there's probably only 10 minutes of footage where something even remotely interesting is going on. To be honest I have absolutely no idea how anyone can be giving this film a rating of more than 2/10, unless they were involved with the film, are critics who have completely lost their integrity to a pile of cash, or have the mental prowess of a toddler.

There are cameras than just the one from the last movie and there are more characters than just one couple.  But more does not make better.  In fact, it decreases the suspense.  More means there is less 'alone' time for the characters.  Also, the fear is spread amongst more people; therefore, it is felt less by each.  The film Paranormal Activity scared the crap out of me.  There were long, static shots of a room and an occasional event.  This time, the long shots are much shorter and since there are multiple cameras, no room is the main focus like the bedroom was last time.  Furthermore, there was no build up to an event last time.  A door would slam or the sheet would rustle all without warning.  Now there is a low, rumbling bass noise which signals a coming event.  This takes most of the fear of anticipation out of the scene.  The plot is actually connected to the previous film but I won't give away how.  The idea of a sequel to Paranormal Activity is fine and the script works...but there is too much activity going on to make it truly paranormal.  If you haven't seen the first one, I highly recommend it.  Skip this one.",

Additionally, it takes itself 72% of the runtime to present the first jump-scare, which is a shame for a movie of this genre.

That was because it was all so subtle and relied so heavily on your imagination to make it work, and I just don't think the second film valued that as much as it should have done. Certain scenes were okay and pretty creepy, other scenes just screamed 'strings' at me which immediately broke my connection with it. Things happened in the first film that looked real and possible and the action built up, only to peak pretty much at the end of the film. I felt like this film started at that high and the smaller, subtle things from the first were brushed aside a little too eagerly. Overall, if you find these sorts of films interesting to watch then you'll probably like it regardless of its slightly more 'obvious' nature.

I like the way that the film involved a true family rather than just a couple. That dynamic made the horror all the more terrifying.

It takes a little while for the movie to get going but I was completely engaged for the whole second half. All the characters manage to stay likeable which I could not say about Featherston and Micah Sloat in the first movie. The horror is very much the same as the horror in the first movie but I actually found it more scary than its predecessor.
