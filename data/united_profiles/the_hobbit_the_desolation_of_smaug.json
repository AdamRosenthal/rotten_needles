This, however, was a complete embarrassment to the Lord of the Rings series, J.R.R. Tolkien and Peter Jackson. I wanted to love it, I even forced myself to sit through the entire thing in theaters, but I just hate it. I would not take a copy of this home if you offered it to me for free, because I know watching it would only make me angry and disappointed all over again. As someone who has read all of the books and previous movies, this just felt like a pathetic excuse for a move today. This just felt like a \"filler\" film between two movies. Perhaps it was the producers being greedy, wanting 3 movies out of a book that is smaller than the smallest volume of the Lord of the Rings. However it happened, it was just disgraceful. More than half of the scenes were pulled straight out of thin air. Only a few were actually from the book this trilogy is supposed to be based on, like the barrels scene and Bilbo's talk with Smaug (although the sequence the followed was NOTHING like the book's version). What little plot that was included was embellished and out of order, and honestly were ruined for me by the imagined plots thrown into the film. On top of all that, this film had terrible pacing, and was outright cheesy at times. This was just a really, really sad excuse for a sequel. I wish they had just followed the book and stuck to two movies, the original plan. Not even sure if I am going to see the third one at this point, given the way this one turned out. Such a big fan of Tolkien's work and what Peter Jackson has done with his other novels, but this was just painful. Friends don't let friends who have read the book watch this move. Gets a 0/10 for me. I felt like not only did I waste my money, but I should have been paid to watch this poor excuse for a film.",

      "text": "The most dissapointing film of 2013. Jackson has completely mangled the books. The original core (a children's book about Bilbo finding his inner Took) has been dumbed down to an action film. Don't get me wrong, the film is extremely well filmed and it's Middle Earth in all its glory, but it's not 'The Hobbit'. Where Jackson would leave out or alter minor details in the original Lord of the Rings trilogy, he's added extra, unnecessary details. Legolas wasn't in the book and neither was Tauriel, not to mention Azog. He has even added material from the Appendix of the Return of the King! The film should have been ONE film without any added details rather than 3 films that are way too full of unnecessary details. The film could be a lot of fun for people that have no idea what the original book is about, but for people that read the book it's a huge dissapointment. I don't think I'll go to the third film, as I can't bear to see what Jackson will turn the Battle of the Five Armies to. Sorry Jackson, but you messed up big time with The Hobbit pt2. If you enjoy an action film that has the likes of Middle Earth, this is for you. If you like the lore and any backstory whatsoever, stay away from this abomination.",

      "text": "Coming a year after the underrated and underappreciated \u201cThe Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,\u201d Peter Jackson strikes again with the year\u2019s best movie- \u201cThe Hobbit: The Desolation Of Smaug.\u201d  After a brief prologue featuring an excellent flashback conversation between Thorin Oakenshield and the wizard Gandalf, the movie hits the ground running and pretty much never looks back.  This is a much more action packed movie than its predecessor, featuring an intense giant spider attack sequence in Mirkwood Forest, a thrilling river barrel chase sequence as the dwarves attempt to escape from Elvish captors, an intense battle between Gandalf and Sauron, and a non-stop battle with the Dragon Smaug at the end.  As is to be expected, all technical credits are first rate, from the often brilliant special effects, to the stirring Howard Shore musical score, to the excellent use of High Frame Rate 3D.  In addition, the film delivers some outstanding acting, with particularly good performances from Richard Armitage as Thorin Oakenshield, Martin Freeman as Bilbo Baggins and Luke Evans as a well-developed and sympathetic Bard the Bowman.  It is also great to see Orlando Bloom\u2019s Legolas back in action, and despite the initial controversy, the addition of Evangilne Lilly as the female elf warrior Tauriel is a welcome addition, even if she does not appear in the book.  The crowning achievement of the movie, however, is the Dragon Smaug (the best dragon ever portrayed on the silver screen) and his initial reveal in the ancient kingdom of Erebor is absolutely perfect.  This is followed by an Indiana Jones style climax that ends in a real cliffhanger that might irritate some.  For me it just means that the final movie, \u201cThe Hobbit: There And Back Again\u201d will launch with an absolutely incredible action sequence.  Like \u201cThe Lord Of The Rings: The Two Towers\u201d, \u201cDesolation\u201d does not really have a beginning or an end, but like that brilliant movie, it is definitely one hell of a middle.",

This movie was definitely a step down from every other movie in middle earth so far. The cinematography was gorgeous and there were a lot of really great shots. However the movie really falters in the way that it was adapted. If you liked the book for it's humor, lovable characters and charm you will e sorely disappointed. The lighthearted essence of a childrens book is gone in order to make it much darker. Also there is an incredible amount of filler, and to make time for the filler they cut or dramatically altered the actual content from the book. My last complaint is about legolas, why was he in the movie at all? It ruins any tension involved in those scenes because you know hes going to make it, before seeing the movie i thought his involvement would be a short cameo at most, maybe something to do with Gollum. No instead he is one of the central characters in the film. Overall i would say that this movie was disapointing as a LotR fan but a well shot movie with some good cgi and action sequences.",

The best scenes in my opinion were near the end and the scenes between Killi and the She-Elf. In my opinion, there was a bit too much CGI, I much prefer real sets but for the Orcs the CGI was perfect because it felt like they were actually fighting monsters not just men dressed up as monsters. The Orcs were perfect in my opinion, just a shame they have too much elven language, I much prefer the Orcs to act stupid and speak english than speak in this poetic manner, okay it's fine for the white orc because he's badass but his little grunts should speak english. The CGI, although a lot of it, was probably the best I've seen in a film, it really allowed the filmmakers to create more of a fantasy world instead of just showing us New Zealand, which isn't bad by the way. I found it thoroughly entertaining but The Hobbit works and flows best when it's just trying to be its own film. When you clearly hear lines and jokes copied from LOTR it's kind of cringey, they don't need to please  LOTR fans they need to just clear their heads and focus on the story at hand. Either way, great film just hopefully for the next film we'll see more real sets and action sequences in places like Helm's Deep, like an out door set, they're so cool.",

Desolation of Smaug offers much improved CGI (when compared to An Unexpected Journey), a soundtrack wrapped in nostalgia, and non-stop action from start to finish. Unlike the first installment in this new trilogy, the Desolation of Smaug feels much more free from the confines of staying true to the book. It really feels like Jackson just had fun making this movie, dotting it with welcome humor and incredible action. Legolas and Tauriel discover the most creative ways to slay orcs, and trust me, everything about their addition is epic and memorable. Without them, a lot of the intensity and uniqueness of the action scenes may have been lost. And then of course you have Smaug, who is undoubtedly the most impressive dragon I have ever witnessed. Ever. And Benedict Cumberbatch's voice only perfects an already astoundingly memorable creation. Smaug is most certainly up there with the best of the best.",

There is some perfectly timed comedy moments, some tense moments which is really helped by the brilliant character development and those cute little Dwarves. Most of the animation was superb, I think Smaug was done brilliantly, however there were some moments which really stood out as very bad animation such as moments in the barrel ride scene and some moments in the halls of Erebor. The side stories with Gandalf discovering Sauron's return and the love triangle with Tauraylon, Legolas and Kili really complement the main action, and I actually am starting to like the fact they added more orcs to the story, unlike An Unexpected Journey where they're existence was annoying and pointless.

If I were to fault this movie on anything it would be that I have to wait until December 2014 before actually seeing the finale. I found the acting, set design, costume, writing, and lore to be engrossing and enthralling. Of anything to criticize it would be the endemic problem of multiple special effects studios working on a project which can lead to variation in the look which can be bothersome. While the movie may not have been completely straight with the book, I never found a single instance where I think they slipped up. Any additional content was superbly meshed into the framework of the original story, giving it several fleshed-out story lines to follow. I wasn't expecting to appreciate this series to the level I have, and I am enticed by the amount of detail poured into these projects. One way to heighten the experience could be to try and explain the majority of the LOTR world to a fellow movie-goer not aware of any previous information even the first movie. It really helps bring out how much thought is required to keep such a complex multi-faceted world going in a script and then portrayed in a movie. I would recommend this to anyone, especially if they have even a little time to dig into the wonder that Tolkien's, and now Jackson's, mind has crafted.",

Also, if you are honest with yourself, you will notice that the background images look fake, this is because of the higher definition playback.

Our characters simply start at one place, visit two more, and finish at a fourth place.  Nothing is accomplished or lost, and the stakes do not change.  In short, this is not a movie, in the sense that a movie is about characters and throughlines and arcs and narrative dynamics.  This is simply a part of a movie, or worse yet, an FX reel with some dialogue attached.

But, The desolation of Smaug went so far off the beat-in path from the book its not even funny. There was less of the book and more screen play. I understand writing a movie screen play is different than the writing of a book. But Jackson Literally killed The book! With the addition of parts (Far to many added into the screen play) and again not enough from the book! All these positive reviews people must not have read the book. Jackson took a great book and turned it into a whore. That he could pimp out over the span of 3 movies for money.  Other than the fact that a character in the movie is in fact a hobbit.

      "text": "I was one of the people who really enjoyed the first Hobbit movie, as opposed to a majority of critics who saw Peter Jackson's return to Middle-Earth as long and poorly paced. I, on the other hand, enjoyed the new protagonist. Bilbo was an awesome character who, unlike Frodo, went through a noticeable change in character, was extremely useful to his group, and had a memorable personality from one of Hollywood's finest actors (Martin Freeman). That being said, I find it ironic that opinions are completely reversed in the Desolation of Smaug. Critics appreciate this film more, while I believe it lost the magic of the original. Bilbo has already underwent his transformation into a heroic Hobbit, thereby leaving him as merely a side-note on the quest of the dwarves to reclaim their homeland from Smaug the dragon. There are so many new additions that don't work (an awkward love triangle between Legolas, another elf, and one of the dwarves) that it seems silly that the movie even be called The Hobbit at all. It really should be called \"The Reclamation of Erebor: The Quest of the Dwarves, Two Elves, Gandalf, and...Oh Yeah, There Was a Hobbit Somewhere in There.\" Bilbo's story is really lost in this movie beneath nauseating action sequences (I still don't enjoy the camerawork in the film) and a boatload of side characters who serve typically one purpose and have little to invest in. Beorn, one of my favorite characters in the novel, is seen for all of three minutes in this film and is never truly fleshed out. Despite all this, I did enjoy the movie for a few reasons. First, while the action sequences did make my head spin, there are some incredible moments. The barrel riding scene is one of the coolest fights I've seen on the big screen in a long while. In addition, there are some exceptions to the list of boring new characters, including Bard, who is torn between aiding new friends to saving his hometown from inevitable destruction. Also, the path of Thorin and his doubts as he tries to reclaim the throne is always entertaining to see. However, Desolation of Smaug is more sparkle than substance, and is nowhere near as entertaining as the original film. Too many unnecessary additions mask the true stars of the movie, and an added emphasis of action over storytelling makes Bilbo's second romp through Middle Earth more of a misfire than a stellar sequel.",

      "text": "I am a huge fan of both Tolkien's works and Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy, and I was pleased to hear a few years ago that Jackson would be giving the Lord of the Rings prequel, The Hobbit, the same treatment. I was, however, a bit apprehensive when I heard they were making it a trilogy. Last year's frankly quite disappointing start to the series was everything I feared it would be: bloated and, at parts, boring. This year's addition had no such problems. It was a fun, engaging, and exciting adventure, from the beginning meeting with the skinchanger Beorn to the confrontation with the dragon Smaug at the end. The acting, as should be expected, was incredible, especially on the parts of Martin Freeman, Richard Armitage, and the always excellent Sir Ian McKellan. And Smaug is absolutely incredible. Both in the way he looks and the treatment he is given by voice actor Benedict Cumberbatch, Smaug will amaze and terrify you, just as he is meant to in the books. However, this movie was definitely not free of problems. While the action scenes are fun and entertaining, a few of them definitely could have been sacrificed. The dwarves' journey through Mirkwood was barely even touched on, as was Beorn. Maybe this just irks me because I'm a fan of the book; I'm sure audiences would much rather see the dwarves duke it out with a giant dragon in a thirty minute fight scene than trek through a dark forest. Even so, they turned a three hundred page book into three two and a half hour films, and they still found a way to make the beginning of this movie feel rushed. The movie, however, does eventually find its footing, and it is highly enjoyable the rest of the way through. Even with the reappearance of the Lord of the Rings' Legolas (Orlando Bloom), who does not appear in the Hobbit, and the addition of a completely new character, a female elf named Tauriel (Evangeline Lilly), the movie stays mostly true to the book, and the changes it does make have no major effect on the direction of the story. All in all, this movie was both a great, entertaining improvement on the first film, and an excellent setup for the events of the next. While Desolation of Smaug may not have been perfect, it has certainly given me high hopes for the final film.",

The story lacks any substances consisting of lots of filler and pointless action which goes on for far too long. The characters are not that interesting or developed. This movie is so focused on flashing CGI and dumb action scenes that it fails to provide any real substance to justify it being three movies. This is a two part movie that should have stayed a two part movie or been one long movie. As it is Peter Jackson has yet to convince me that three 2 hour and 40 minute movies are necessary. If you are a die-hard Lord of the Rings fan check it out but if you want something with substance there is none here. This movie is a whole lot of nothing Bland, forgettable, and excessive filler. It had an entertaining first half but once you realize this movie has nothing to offer in terms of character and story but just mindless action you will be disappointed.

Further, the acting and action scenes were occasionally so over the top that they come off as unintentionally comical.

The one knock against it is that it didn't give me the same \"epic\" feeling the lord of the rings movies and the first hobbit movie gave me. It didn't seem as grand an adventure as the first one. And I also feel there is too much computer animation which takes away from the realism. In any case I still very much liked it and highly recommend you go see it!",

One you have a great creature creation that Weta can show off, but you also have great action sequences that looked amazing in the high frame rate.  The problems of straining my eyes were no longer there and I was able to just absorb everything on the screen.  The film still has pacing problems and the characters just aren't as lively or interesting as the LOTR.  The biggest problem is the story only really offers dwarves getting in and out of shenanigans and nothing else really propels the story forward until smaug shows up.  All that being said its much better than the first and it has me anticipating the final act, which hopefully will shave off another ten minutes from its running time and be ever sharper.",

I enjoyed it from start to finish, visuals can\u00b4t get any better, good acting (actor playing Bilbo was an amazing choice, he is fantastic for this), the pacing was great this time because the start of the film was strong, this younger Legolas we didn\u00b4t know is great to see, the new Elfo woman is a good character too, the King of the Elves from the forest seems like a great and intimidating character too (I\u00b4m sure we\u00b4ll see him a lot in the last part of the trilogy) and of course the moment we finally get to see Smaug is impressive, very entertaining and spectacular.

One of the most impressive things about the movie was they added Legolas and a new Elven character, and it didn't feel shoehorned or forced, it actually made sense. A problem I had with the first film in this trilogy was that the pacing was uneven and all over the place. This one, however, the pacing is consistent for the most part(except for the lake village). While many of the dwarf characters in the first one felt underdeveloped and were more like throwaways than actual characters, many of the dwarves get to shine in this. Benedict Cumberbatch as Smaug is sensational. And it looks like Bilbo is beginning to reach his full potential. In conclusion, 2/3s in, I don't think The Hobbit trilogy will ever reach the heights of the masterful Lord of the Rings, I can still enjoy the ride, especially The Desolation of Smaug. 8/10",

However, the addition of Tauriel and the big changes in Smaug's scenes bothered me quite a bit.  I still found the movie to be enjoyable, but it's far from Jackson's best work.",

Probably not; but I must say this was quite improvement and it seems as if he\u2019s striving to return to the glory of the first trilogy. \u2018The Desolation of Smaug\u2019 was an exciting \"little\" epic and it feels much more purposeful than the first film. The story continues with the band of dwarves on their journey to reclaim the Misty Mountain, which was overrun by the vain and cruel Dragon named, Smaug (perfectly voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch). Of course, along the way, they encounter a great deal of danger which... of course, was engineered to the finest degree. The action sequences did run for too long in many instances, but they were creatively staged; and Jackson and his legions visual effects specialists continue their win streak in this department. One aspect that falls utterly short was the length and enormity of the film; which doesn't match the scope of the relatively small story. A sentiment I also expressed with the first installment, though to a lesser degree, here. This time around the film was filled with too many neat gimmicks (take Legolas\u2019 inclusion as an example) and uninspired subplots, such as the Elven-Dwarf love triangle. Thankfully these stumbles did not do much damage to the main story line, which is setting up dominoes for an epic conclusion, but they do highlight flaws in the screenwriting department. These things aside, \u2018The Desolation of Smaug\u2019 was an entertaining, visually appetizing film; that should please fans of the original trilogy and newer followers, if even solely for its pure level of charm.",

This is similar to the mispronunciation of Aang as \"ong\" in the Avatar movie, it's wildly noticeable and degrades the experience. Overall, this has to be the weakest film in the series, designed only to make money on sub-par writing and inane extension of the middle bits.

Though this is exactly what happened in the book, I think this would have resulted with an even greater amount of eye-rolling, if not more, than has been expressed in any number of reviews.",

The film seems as though it was written lazily, leading to numerous plot holes. it also skims over material from the book and instead chooses to add 30 minute action sequences which don't make sense (what was the point of all that gold?) Its poorly paced with predicable action sequences to keep the audience from falling asleep due to all the filler. It is by no means a terrible film, and if you liked LOTR its worth watching, but if you are a genuine fan of Tolkien and his books you will be disappointed.",

Smaug is terrifyingly captivating, more grandeur than I had ever imagined from the books.  Just as we meet him and the movie starts to get good, it ends.

      "text": "It's no LOTR but this is certainly much better than the first movie. The high frame rate doesn't annoy me as much, probably because I'm use to it now but I wasn't back then when the first movie came out in theatres. Back then it looked more like a video game and there was really no value to it. Sadly, some of the problems from the first movie are still present in this movie. It's like 3 hours long (which would be okay if it wasn't boring half the time) and it's overstuffed with underdeveloped characters. The fact that this movie uses footnotes from many of Tolkien's other novels means that it's not truly faithful to the original source material, too often it diverts away from the main story. Only the devoted Tolkien fans (not me) would get the most out of it but for the uninitiated (me), it just feels like a lot of subplots. There's really no need to extend a short children's book into a trilogy. The only reason for that is to make even more money (obviously 3 is more than 1). The Hobbit trilogy is just Peter Jackson's way of reliving his golden era when the LOTR trilogy was critically and commercially successful, with the last movie winning Best Picture award. This movie would be better off as one movie, or maybe even a two-parter because at least then it would be more faithful to the book. But of course, all the good points in the last movie are present in this movie as well such as the film's visual style, score, special effects and the wonderful performances from the cast. This movie is more action packed than the last one which makes it more enjoyable and stand out as an exciting fantasy adventure in it's own right. I do hate that it's a bit of a disappointment when you compare it to LOTR therefore, I won't be expecting the last movie to meet the same standard (but I do hope it's good). I do understand that the books are very different from each other but Peter Jackson's direction makes the two franchises very similar to each other. He does almost everything he did back when he was directing LOTR so don't b***h about how it's unfair to compare The Hobbit to LOTR. If you're already a fan of the first movie, no doubt you'll enjoy this one.",

From what I understand, Legolas was not in the book and this is made abundantly clear here when all of his scenes literally add nothing to the movie and the adventures of the dwarves or Gandalf. Heck, even Gandalf's side journey (which is in the book) adds nothing here to this story. It just serves as distraction from what the movie is allegedly building up to, only to then cut off and not do anything until the third movie. Film is not television. Cliff hangers should not be allowed like this. In film, it makes the product feel entirely unfinished and prevents the film from being able to standalone from the rest of the franchise. Instead, The Desolation of Smaug willingly plays in the problems faced by many middle entry stories in that it is neither the beginning or the end. Even worse, the film repeatedly does shoutouts to Lord of the Rings. Again, I know it is a prequel, but I also know that every little shoutout it does is not in the book. More than anything, these moments feel as though they are simply trying to garner goodwill based on the success of the Lord of the Rings films. Unfortunately for Desolation of Smaug, this does not work and the end product is simply a thoroughly average film that may entertain at times, but has serious pacing issues and drags from beginning to end.",

This film resides firmly in the second camp, and everything works better for it. For example, the escape from the Woodland Realm is every bit as over the top as the last film's escape from Goblin-town, but it doesn't feel so out of place, so it's easier just to kick back and enjoy the ride. The changes from the book once again mostly work, and in this case actually make more sense. Bard the Bargeman might not be as awesome as Bard the Bowman, at least not yet, but he is much more fleshed out, and the film finally gives the Company a decent reason for needing a burglar.

This movie is much faster paced and darker than the first. We finally get to see smaug who is terrifically voiced by Benedict cumberbatch. He and our hero exchange some clever word play. We get introduced to legleos more nods to the previous lord of the rings movies. We also get introduced to a new cast member and her name is tourial and she is a bad ass. With it's pacing issues mostly fixed i found The love story stupid and unnecessary also the laketown politics should have been cut down significantly. The fact that some of the characters in laketown were annoying ahem Alfred did not help either. Other than that The second movie returns with what you love elves, wizards men legeos giant spider battles the necromancer and a brilliant finale battle with smaug the terrible. This movie is a bit of a improvement over the first but with an unnecessary love story and laketown politics that seem to drag on forever keeps this movie from being great.",

      "text": "Sadly, Walsh, Boyens and Jackson opted to remove most of the interesting materials from Tolkien's heartfelt work in this installment in favor of inserting irrelevant interspecies love stories, pointless politics and endless, shiny CG violence. The desolation of this installment is the lack of growth of the film's protagonist, who is relegated to supporting player and foil for a visually impressive, but soulless CGI dragon. The crux of this film's problem lies in the decision of Jackson, Warner Brothers, New Line and MGM in turning a two-picture-at-best story into a generic action film which appeals to a broader demographic. The collaborators' decision to include appendix material isn't the problem - it provides welcome explanations for Gandalf's seemingly fairweather loyalty to the party. The problem is that new materials, specifically the romance and the politics are mundane and hamfisted. Much of the wonder of An Unexpected Journey and The Fellowship of the Ring are missing from The Desolation of Smaug. The accessibility of Tolkein's The Hobbit lies in the fact that it is a first person narrative. Unfortunately, due to the deep cynicism of the entertainment industry, in an effort to emulate other action film franchises, it has produced another generic e-ticket ride to nowhere.",
