Written by Ms. Schumer and directed by Judd Apatow, this film amply displays the acting talents of Ms Schumer as well as her extraordinary writing talents. Deeply moving in the relations Ms. Schumer\u2019s character has with her sister and divorced father, the film is able to generate great pathos and sentiment while at the same time causing us to laugh and appreciate each moment. LeBron James, playing himself, has a significant role in the move and together with other notable NBA figures, gives a degree of authenticity and honesty to the story. Most of all it is Ms. Shcumer\u2019s film for she proves once again that the transition from comedy to drama is easier to achieve for a comic than it is for a dramatic star to do comedy.. This is a thoroughly enjoyable film to watch and to experience great writing as well. I give the film 3 and \u00bd stars and recommend it to audiences and viewers of all ages.",

Of course there is a great difference between writing a 5 minute (or 22 minute) sketch and a full length feature, and perhaps under Judd Apatow's (never met a 90 minute film that can't be padded to over 2-2 1/2 hours) direction and guidance, she didn't tighten the script firmer. There are many, many laughs to be sure. And the supporting cast is crammed with talent. All the talk is about Lebron James, but what about John Cena (hilarious), Colin Quinn, Vanessa Bayer, Randall Park, Jon Glaser, Mike Birbiglia, hell, Tim Meadows absolutely kills in the small cameo he appears in...Although the main character is an mess, the movie follows the standard rom-com formula. Couple meet, fall in like, conflict pulls them apart, they get together after one of them realizes that they DO love them..Some scenes could have been trimmed and one, the intervention with Chris Evert, Mathew Broderick and  Marv Albert (YES!!) could have been cut completely. I will admit whatever faults Apatow has as a director, he does let his cast shine from top to bottom.",

It also doesn't help that I'm generally not a fan of rom-coms. Believe it or not, I was actually pleasantly surprised with this one. Not only did Schumer manage to not annoy the crap out of me (for most of it at least), but it also had a lot of really funny moments, great one-liners, and some fun cameos (John Cena, LeBron James, Method Man, even Daniel Radcliffe and Marisa Tomei!) In addition, it also had a surprising amount of heart to it, which I certainly wasn't expecting. Overall, depending on your tolerance for rom-coms in general, you may or may not enjoy it. On the other hand, if you can get past that and you happen to be a fan of Apatow and his previous films, I'd say it's definitely worth a view.",

Pile on to that, TRAINWRECK is simply too long, lethargic, and just not very funny. And perhaps worse than anything, poor Brie Larson, who is quite the actress, is here relegated to playing the sister/homemaker with no bite or attitude.

She is, quite frankly, obnoxious. Surprisingly she isn't a bad actress but too often her true personality comes through and, as a protagonist, it destroys much of the film. I think she would be better suited for the obnoxious friend of the main girl. Bill Hader does a solid job but is mostly forgettable. Honestly, the only reason this film is worth watching is for the plethora of celebrity cameos, highlighted by LeBron James. They all play versions of themselves in hilarious skits that fit neatly into the plot. If it wasn't for James, John Cena, Amare Stoudemire, etc. this film would be among the worst comedies I've seen in recent memory.",

Occasionally you hear someone say that having a likable protagonist is not important. They're wrong (and I suspect they are jerks who secretly identify with jerk protagonists).

In that regard, the entire relationship with Bill Hader's character is fantastic and feels real and authentic. Their problems and approaches are really relatable for most people and the film handles it very well. While I love the emotional aspect of the film, the comedic aspect really peaks with John Cena and LeBron James. Every scene those two are involved in is hysterical and a real riot. I do not like Amy Schumer's comedy and I was ready to hate this one, but this film has a real charm that sweeps you in and it avoids turning into just another raunchy sex comedy. Instead, it is a smart sex comedy that has some interesting commentary on relationships and sex. Amy Schumer is pretty good here, though I loved Tilda Swinton and Brie Larson the most here.

There is really nothing wrong with Schumer\u2019s performance I just didn\u2019t understand the huge critical acclaim.

I am not an easy disgusted person, but really, how many lewd sex jokes can you fit into a movie? This brand of comedy isn't for me, I guess. I just wish that the overall movie had been interesting so I could have something to follow along with between the non-existent laughs. It just felt that the movie tried so hard to shock me, but really it fell flat on its face. Maybe it could shock my 70 year old grandmother....",

Schumer's character is a women in her 30's who doesn't care much about relationships with men. Bill Hader plays her so called love interest in this boring 2 hours comedy. The only real bright spots were cameos of Lebron James and Marv Albert.  Comedies seem to be going completely in the toilet lately and this is one of them.",

Trainwreck brings the laugh through sexual and blunt humor, much like Amy Schumer\u2019s style of stand-up. She makes constant jokes about sexual innuendos and also constant jokes that comes out as blunt honesty. For some, not their cup of tea but for many, this movie has done quite well and hits them right in the funny bone (which I understand is not quite funny at all but\u2026.you get the gist.",

Maybe because white trash drunks are boring in real life, I found Amy Schumer's character more sad and boring than funny or interesting to watch. Bill Hader's comedic talents are not present in this movie, and his \"doctor\" character goes rapidly from his own boredom with Amy's character to being suddenly and inexplicably ( within minutes) ready to go out for dinner and a drink with her. There's no believable transition into this romance. Poor, sad Amy just didn't have a sports doctor to show her how great life really is? Unh-hunh. okay. We didn't make it through the whole thing....fell asleep as soon as Bill and Amy went out for their first drink.",
