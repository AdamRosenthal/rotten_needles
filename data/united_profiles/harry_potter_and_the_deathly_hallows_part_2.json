Something is lost as the series ends.  The first big books they ever read, and the first big kid movies they ever watched.  The movie is wonderful.  The series is wonderful.

However, I have watched every film so I've managed to keep up with the series.  As a result, I will rate this AS A FILM rather than a book adaptation.  As a film, this is fantastic on every front.  Splitting the film into two parts was the best thing they could've done.  I felt the first part had a couple of pacing issues, but was still pretty great.  This one is perfectly paced.  I was gripped constantly.  A fantastic balance of story and action.  Every character was excellent portrayed and I really felt that each one of them had a good level of depth. The script was also fantastic.  It never felt clich\u00c3\u00a9, the amount of humour was just right and it's just overall very well written.  The action, the story, the character development, the romance, the humour.  It's all so perfectly balanced.  Nothing ever felt forced.  Overall this is a phenomenal film.  Every Harry Potter fan should see this, and even if you aren't a fan, watch it because it's a GOOD film (though I would recommend at least watching a couple of the previous films beforehand to have some sort of an idea of what's going on).",

This movie diverges from the actual book way more than I could appreciate as a HP fan. The Hogwarts battle scenes seem to be the director's own version of the events rather than a recreation of the book (if you've seen the trailers, you would have suspected as much). Unfortunately, while the first four movies brilliantly followed the books (given the time constraints of a movie), ever since director David Yates got involved, the movies have moved away from the books (Half Blood Prince being a great example of Yates doing his own thing). Deathly Hallows 2 in my view does an even poorer job of visually recreating the book than Half Blood Prince did. In summary a most disappointing end to the Harry Potter years",

But what I can say is that, while the books are incredible (from what I hear), most movies are not true screen adaptations that capture everything that might be important or wonderful from the text.  Yates did a wonderful job wrapping up the series.  Deathly Hallows Part 2 comes off as more engaging and more fun than Part 1 as a movie, given that there is a lot more going on, and ultimately ends up being one of the most enjoyable Harry Potter films of the whole series.  I would have gladly given another 20 minutes for Yates & crew to explain and appropriately tie up the entire story as many fans (both those who enjoyed and were disappointed) have commented on.  But what's done is done.  It's not quite perfect, but it's a wonderful and successful ending to what has been one of the most important adaptations ever.  I'll certainly miss seeing the world and characters of Harry Potter in new ways, but at least there were so many films to give breath visually to a series JK Rowling created... and in the scope of a childrens novel.  The movie is great, and it leaves you wanting more as it makes an exit in \"styyyle\".",

Snape's flashbacks were brilliantly done, and this time, every departure from the book only makes the impact greater.

We've been set up for 11 years for the momentum that must carry this film, and it's all stops and starts.  Not good. Then, and also irrespective of Rowling's story, I was deeply disturbed by Voldemort's weak agenda. Haven't we been led to anticipate that, in full power, he is going to consume the world? So - why is he so triumphant at the Hogwarts scene, as though the school were his ultimate goal? The Voldemort I've been expecting would not bother making a recruitment speech to the kids. They join or die, period, and he's too flimsy here to be truly scary. On the plus side: Rickman is fabulous. Radcliffe is better than he ever was. AT LAST, Maggie Smith gets to strut her stuff.  That makes it worth it. But...this was not a truly successful film conclusion to the saga.  And, to be rather **** I so wanted a bit more oomph when Mrs. Weasley takes out Bellatrix.

      "text": "It would be a lie if I said I was completely happy with this movie. The main reason being that, given the movie was split into two films for the purpose of staying true to the book, there was still many variations to Rowling's text in Hallows Part 2. These variations however, proved to make the movie more action orientated, cinematic and easy to understand for fans of the movies and not the books. I am only disappointed at the fact that because of past movies, Hallows Part 2 needed to tie loose ends in accordance with what was seen on screen and not in the books. As an adaptation, I feel somewhat cheated, due to the fact that the text was so rich with detail that went unseen in the film. As an action film however, Hallows Part 2 does extremely well. The main plot-line is still there, and I am pleased that Yates really delivered in the final battle. (In the book, the final battle is not as tense nor engaging and I commend Yates for his work). Soundtrack was magnificent, which really added to certain scenes in the film, especially 'Snapes Memories' and the scene where Harry  knew he was going to die. These amendments all add to the missing scenes from the text, which makes this film a fitting finale.",

      "text": "It all has to end, every single minute of the 18 hour-long Harry Potter movies preceding this one have been leading up to this moment. There was incredible hype for The Deathly Hallows Part 2 ever since the final scenes of the DH 1, and it has the impossible task of meeting the expectations that it has set for itself which is incredibly high. This is the perfect way to end the best movie franchise ever made. It's amazing to actually take a step back and look at all of the 8 movies, it never drops in quality and the shifts in the tone of the movies is just bloody awesome from the Sorcerer's Stone's light, funny, cheerful tone to the very dark and serious tone of the Half-Blood Prince, and Deathly Hallows 1 and 2. As always Mr Yates gets into the thick of the action and assumes that the audience knows everything and literally picks up where DH1 ended. Hogwarts surrounded by hovering Dementors and a despondent-looking new headmaster Severus Snape, cue the title sequence. You know you're in good hands. For the fans who did not like the DH1 citing a lack of action sequences and a slow dragging story (I really enjoyed DH1) will be satisfied with this one. Almost immediately it starts with a break-in into Gringotts bank with Harry and a creepy looking goblin on his back under the invisibility cloak, Ron wearing a goatee and Hermione taking the form of Bellatrix Lestrange via the polyjuice potion. Helena Bonham Carter was absolutely amusing impersonating Emma Watson's character impersonating her. Searching for a horcrux, followed swiftly by an abrupt escape plan with the trio holding on for dear life on a dragon. Action sequence junkies you'll love this movie. The special effects in this one is great, amazing looking wand duels, knights, trolls and everything in between as Hogwarts is turned into a battlefield not dissimilar to the Lord of the Rings' movies. The calm before the storm is very similar to The Two Towers when they're preparing for the arrival of Voldermort and his posse, everything is so well-paced and the story just flows effortlessly. But even with all that in abundance, the heart of the movie will always be in the close intimate scenes, the CGI effects will never upstage the emotional core of the movie, two life-long friends finally share a tender moment, a boy circled by his deceased family and his reunion with the man he so much admired and so much more. There are a lot of deaths and I'm quite surprised that a fair amount of them occurs off screen, probably it's supposed to give a much stronger impact but I really wanted to see the demise of some of them. All in all the story was very solid and so unbelievably satisfying. Desplat's score, hauntingly magnificent. Truly beautiful and laced with bits from John Williams' and Nicholas Hooper's pieces, reminding us of much simpler and happy times and when everything came crashing down respectively. Eduardo Serra's cinematography is phenomenal, really capturing the look and feel of the movie as he did in part 1, you really feel that death is coming for Hogwarts. The stand-out performance for DH 1 was Emma Watson, DH 2 is where Daniel Radcliffe really shines. Harry Potter is no longer just the boy who lived, he's grown into a man on a mission, now equipped with a sense of authority and no one really questions him anymore, it's best to let him do what needs to be done. The negotiation scene with the goblin and with Mr. Ollivander was just so intense and delicately captured on screen showcasing a different side to Mr. Radcliffe. He was given a lot of dramatic and emotionally-heavy scenes and he really delivered, this was his movie along with Emma Watson and Rupert Grint, who have been in their roles for 10 years now, their casting really made the movie what it is. And let's not forget the most impressive supporting cast ever assembled with a slew of great British actors, you know who they are. Ralph Fiennes is menacing as the immortal Lord Voldermort but every time a Horcrux is destroyed he gets progressively weaker and Mr Fiennes' performance is very delicate showing the Dark Lord's vulnerability. Then there was the half-blood prince's revelatory piece which almost reduced me to tears. That was a heart-breaking montage of Snape's agendas and his sacrifices. Alan Rickman was outstanding showing the deeper, more emotional side of Severus Snape, give the man an Oscar already. For those that have been following ever since the first movie, the reward here is extremely gratifying. The epilogue of the movie which was set 19 years later was very bittersweet, did'tt want it to end. The final few moments before the screen faded to black, and before the sun sets on the best franchise ever made I also felt that the sun was setting on my childhood, saw the first movie when I was 10 years old, and it ended with the end of my teen years. I grew up with the movies. What a ride it has been, goodbye Harry Potter..",

The last book was one of my favorites, largely for the dense plot and character nuance that was (not entirely, but somewhat) absent from the film, but I can say that this is one of those rare cases where the changes made were almost entirely for the better. The parts that felt awkward, overly-complex, or overly-convenient in the book are reworked in a way that flows organically, without sacrificing the emotional impact. Almost every character has their moment to shine, and the most heartbreaking scenes from the book are played to perfection (Alan Rickman is outstanding) - it's intense, scary, funny, sad, and above all, satisfying to the people who have spent their childhoods with Harry.

I think the problem with the Harry Potter series is just how a lot of people overlook the sometimes subtle, sometimes painfully obvious undertones and hidden meanings of the scenes and characters. The dementors sucking life out of people like depression for example. I do genuinely believe JK Rowling to be an incredible writer with such an amazing imagination, anyway back to DH2. From the start scene to the end you will be gripped by a fast but well paced action/realistic depiction of war. Even more realistic than most war films out there. The number of casualties, the damage, the destruction and the bravery and terror. If you want to go and watch a film where you will find yourself upset one moment followed closely by a sense of joy then this is definitely the movie for you. How many times I must have been on the verge of crying followed shortly by a one liner that simply picked me up.

After 10 years of waiting and 18 hours of watching Harry and friends grow up I think its time we owed it to ourselves to say our goodbyes and DH2 does this in style.

Sadly, it does all come to an end but the Harry Potter franchise surpasses every expectation and delivers a grandstand finale of epic proportion in what is an unmissable and unforgettable film experiences of all time. With all the high expectations heading into The Deathly Hallows Part 2 it seemed impossible that this film could end up doing what does. Picking up from the tragic ending of Part 1 the film with Harry, Ron and Hermione searching for the remaining Horcruxes to destory Voldemort and Yates sets the tone very early on with an all out action raid on Gringotts bank. The only minor issue that I had with Part 1 was the pacing but this film runs at a very smooth and fast pace. One of the elements Yates displays very convincingly is the transformation in the atmosphere and feeling for the film. Long gone are the happy times of Quidditch, instead you now have the dark, gloomy skies, dragons, death-eaters and the Dark Lord himself. This works a treat because it not only emphasizes that this is the finale to this spectacular series but it makes it much more serious. There light-hearted moments but their timed to perfection and the focus is purely on the the final battle. And that is were this film excels overwhelmingly! The battle scenes were just extraordinary. Visually its encapsulating and mezmerising and once again gets across the epicness of this film. Its been compared to the LotR battle and rightly so its simply oustanding. The story was very well written, Yates manages to combine the story, the pace, the action and the acting incredibly well. One standout, as per usual, is Alan Rickman arguably the greatest performance of the Potter franchise as Severus Snape, he is magic as Snape as his true motives are revealed in what has to be some of the most emotional and poignant scenes of the movie but Daniel Radcliffe has his moment and delivers his best performance saving his best for last, he takes centre stage in the final third and is actually magestic. And there is plenty of emotion as expected after all this is it, the final Potter outing! There are sacrifices, deaths of much loved and maligned faces who we have come to love as well as the romance as Ron and Hermione share that much anticapted kiss. All this leading to the epic showdown between Harry Potter, the boy wonder, and Lord Voldemort. The epilogue in closing the film is very bittersweet seeing each character 19 years down the line was very moving as they sent their kids to Hogwarts but it brought this amazing series of films to a fantastic finish. In closing, I urge any film fan to see this movie. It is utterly essential to see the ending to this epic series. They have certainly saved the best for last and ensure that the greatest film franchise of all time ends in spectular and spell binding style! This film has everything a finale should have and will be remembered for years to come. Having grown up with the series since I was a little kid its sad to bid Harry and co farewell but Im left fully fulfilled and admiring the achievement they have delivered in this epic franchise. Mischief managed Harry, it was magic from start to finish!",

While somehow maintaining the feel of the other films, Deathly Hallows 2 separates itself by knowing that it's the end and therefore bringing with it more emotion, conflict, and symbolism than the others.  Harry's willingness to give his life makes him not foolish for being the hero for once, but rather his maturity is shown to have grown where he can accept circumstance and face it, though with obvious hesitation.  I must say that I particularly enjoyed the way that Snape was performed, since we finally got to see into his past with acting that couldn't have been more perfect.  I think that the reason for this film to be so acclaimed by the critics isn't just for its magnificent conclusion, outstanding acting, and epic story, but also for its subtle universality: we all require love to be inspired to triumph over true evil.",

Seeing the actors growing up onscreen and how their characters evolve over the 7 years at Hogwarts, the series has been a world wide success. And rightly so. Deathly Hallows part 2 certainly lives up to expectations. Fast-paced, funny/emotional/action-packed, visually stunning and the acting seemed better than in previous instalments as well. But it's not without it's problems. The sound seemed to be unusually quiet for an action film, like the Foley artists were taking a long break. The scene with the dragon escaping Gringott's is the best example. There was no urgency to the chaos the dragon was causing. This scene also was over-played. The suspense was over-drawn resulting in knowing when the dragon would burst through the floor of the bank. That would have been a perfect moment to make the audience jump but sadly that did not happen. The music playing over the big fighting scenes also seemed out of place, the sound and the visuals  just didn't match. I was expecting something like with the orchestral power and bravery as heard from LOTR but ended up feeling like the power struggle really wasn't that much of a struggle. Some big opportunities were missed during these big battle moments too. Whereas in the books the reader could feel emotion and loss for the characters that inevitably die (Fred, Lupin, Tonks), here the emotional range was contained to a mere side-effect. Viewers who haven't read the books are surely to be confused too. Horcruxes and wand law are explained in a hurried fashion, leaving the viewer feeling a few steps behind on the action. It's not to say the film hasn't got it's good points (I gave it 9/10 after all!). The audience clapped when Mrs Weasley called Bellatrix Lestrange a **** laughed at Filch earnestly sweeping away the ruinous remains of the castle, and cheered for Dame Maggie Smith who finally gets some decent screen time and a little bit of the action as a Professor who gets to unleash her power \"I've always wanted to do that!\"",

In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2, Yates manages to perfectly balance action with wit, a balance lacked in all of the previous films. A large credit to Steve Kloves who wrote a perfect screenplay to J.K. Rowling's novel. Kloves followed the novel's original creativity while adding his own creativity to the bundle of brilliance. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint are at their best in this final installment. Their performance perfectly depicts J.K. Rowling's original portrayal of Harry, Hermione, and Ron. It's been obvious that a performance like this had been progressing within these three actors ever since 2001 and I'm so glad that it finally came out in the conclusion of Harry Potter, a story about a boy and his scar that will forever live in the hearts of those millions of fans who witnessed a phenomenal story about love, bravery, and the importance of friendship.",

Through ten long years the audience was introduced to Harry and his gang, toured the great Hogwarts facility, and studied the world of magic from the most noble of wizards and witches - all while being kept on the edges of their seats by thrilling action scenes. After so long of watching the gang's adventures one might have felt a desire to visit the magical school themselves, but the routine journeys to Hogwarts are finally over with Voldemort defeated and our favorite friends settling into the long-awaited couples. While the story has come to conclusion, the imagination has not.

Most of Scenes have changed, I can understand cutting out scenes but changing loads of them is wrong. It was rather about special effects than acting, which was terrible and rushed. Just because it is the last film DOESN'T mean it's the best. Disliking my comment won't change the fact, in fact it proves to me. People who say the Book doesn't matter is stupid. It had more heart. I'm not expecting it to be exactly like the Book but I didn't expect to be this bad. To all Harry Potter Fans who haven't read the book or Books, don't call yourself a true fan because your missing 3/4 of the information on each Character, whether it's important or interesting. People were going to give this a high review, mainly because it was the last Harry Potter Film. If you haven't read the Book, you instantly lose your credibility.",

It seems clear that Rowling started writing with a movie consciousness (altering her themes and action in preparation for the big screen) in Goblet of Fire, or at least Order of the Phoenix.

With having said that this movie is clearly just a pop phenomenon which includes horrendous acting, poor screenplay, and terrible directing.  David Yates seems to only high-lite the action sequences and skips through the dialogue and story telling.  I really dont know where Yates got the idea of changing the film to action flik.  I always associated the books with action/adventure or myster/Adventure.  Clearly leanign toward and adventure.  And i dont feel like the movies represent an adventure, rather a trio of teenage wizards who seem to always know what to do.  There is absolutely no build up to anything they do.  For example:  \"Hey, we need to break into Gringots bank\"  (the most difficult bank to break into and considered impossible)  \"OKay,  well give me the sword and i will help you\"  (Scene cuts)  Hermione suddenly changes into Bellatrix and Ron has make up on?  I would be utterly confused if i hadnt read the book.  The movie fails to explain anything that the trio does.  Cut back to part 1 of dh7.  \"Hey!  we need to break into the ministry\" (keep in mind that Harry is the most wanted person in Britiain)  \"Okay\"  cut scene,  the 3 are outside in london knocking out 3 random people who could be normal muggles.  but miraculously they happen to be wizards!  I mean for godsakes David Yates,  build up the **** scenes before jumping into them.  I can piece together each scene because ive read the books and i understand,  but there were so many other scenes in these movies that are just like that.  But, hell who am i right?",

As it happens, this last offering was the most disappointing. One feels as though the actors and the directors are just going through the motions, in the knowledge that with a few special effects here, a few clich\u00c3\u00a9s there, the film will almost certainly become a blockbuster hit, smashing records worldwide. The overwhelmingly positive reviews baffle me. The acting wasn't all that bad,  don't get me wrong, but the problem at the end of the day  was that in the rush to get through the vast plot, we barely got to see the best of any of these talented young actors. There was a distinct lack of speech from any of the characters, and although seven films had preceded it, I did not feel that there was even a tenth of the character development that had made the book so enlightening. A damp squib of a finale.",

Not so in the movie. Also, what was with Voldemort crumbling away like a vampire exposed to sunlight?

This movie could have been reduced to a twenty minute battle without the attempt at an existential crisis and a lot of standing around. I don't blame the producers as anything they seem to put out will sell like hotcakes so it only makes sense to pull this out to two movies, but doesn't mean you should. I'm not a fan of J.K Rowling's writing. As her audience got older with each of her novels she attempted to grow the series with them. This, in my view, failed because she does not have the skills to write anything other than children's novels or how to properly end a series. Keeping this in mind the movie didn't really have a chance to be a good movie, although the ending was better. It probably wasn't possible to get worse as the final battle between Harry and Voldemort lasted longer than one spell. The epilogue bothered me to no end. I was hoping they wouldn't include it as it wraps the book up like a preschooler's picture book. This along with what was seemingly 15 cents as a budget just made it that much worse.

      "text": "Most people expected the final Harry Potter to be good (imagine the outcry if it wasn't - there would be rioting in the streets...probably). Few, I suspect, realised just how exceptional it would turn out to be. It was actually worth the ten years that film-goers have committed to the series! The film resolves all the dangling plot threads and repays it's viewers patience with interest. Deathly Hallows Part 2, unlike it's predecessor (which had the unenviable task of setting up this finale, and thus, tended to drag) is fluidly told, well acted and is an undeniable visual spectacle. For the first time in the series, Daniel Radcliffe really gets to demonstrate his skill as a mature actor - his performance is restrained, but heartfelt and compelling. The real highlight of the series always has been, and continues to be Alan Rickman's Snape - he gives the performance of his career, made even more emotional once the truth about Snape is revealed. The rest of the cast also hold their own, and there are some nice curtain calls, even if you only see some characters for a fraction of a second (blink and you'll miss Miriam Margolyes and Mark Williams!). The effects are superb, the action extremely creative, the whole thing wonderfully filmed. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll be utterly engaged right until the credits role, and Yates brings the saga full circle in a pleasing way (though I'm not a big fan of the prologue). The only real criticisms I've heard of the film thus far are die-hard fans shrieking \"but it's not 100% like the book!\". No it is not like the book. David Yates wasn't writing a book. He was making a film. The changes he made were for the best, and helped the story flow. You cannot adapt a book page-for-page onto film. The film series and books exist as separate entities for the better. They both offer different pleasures. They do not need to be identical, and it is a great blessing that they're not. The past ten years have flown, and the Harry Potter films have left their mark on the world, just as the books have. Mr Potter, we'll miss you.",

This movie did everything it was supposed to do, stay true to the story, and David Yates re-created HP to how he envisioned it in his mind. I'm sure a million other people would've done it a million other ways, but the story was fantastic, as in the book, and the visuals and scenes, and cinematography were all high class. This movie was everything it needed to be and a lot more. Fantastic finale to a fantastic series.

      "text": "Warning: Starts a bit b*tchy, deeper critiques later on.. Coming from a book reader standpoint: completely insulting. The end \"battle\" between Voldemort and Harry felt like a slap in the face. Why did it have to have a battle. The whole point the book tries to make is Harry never attacks Voldemort, and never outright kills him. (In the books) Their very tense last conversation as they circle each other down to the ray of light cutting across the sky was absolutely breathtaking to read. Whereas in the film, they have a full minute hugathon battle across Hogwarts and climaxed in  a game of \"Just the Tip\" with their wands. Other things that bugged me: cartooning Bellatrix's death was just silly. The movie canon never mentioned Lupin and Tonks ever having a child so why did the act like he did at the end? It must of confused non-book readers, same goes for Sirius' mirror shard. Fred's death off-screen (its on screen in the book). Why do all the minor actors in this series like Xenophilius Lovegood (HPDH part 1)  and the actress who plays The Grey Lady have to shout out suddenly and randomly in order to convey emotions, it's almost like the creators felt as though the audience would be too unintelligent to figure out what emotion the actors are feeling or the actors were not good at their parts. And finally simply breaking the UNBEATABLE wand in half like it is really just a twig. I would have liked to give it a better score than a 3 but this movie left me feeling really dead inside, and not because the series was over. I cannot even read the books anymore, which saddens me greatly. And if a movie can have that kind of negative effect on my life, I feel I have to give it what I give it. I know many love it, even the book readers. There are good some things I have to give them props for being topnotch (visual effect and minor things)  with its huge budget and all that keep it from a 1 which is what I want to give it  Non-book readers no doubt found it spectacular, but I can't, in good conscience, give it a better score. The books had been an vast part of my life since I was eight (1999), and the film completely broke me for awhile and there is nothing more that I can say than that.",

However, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 has no sense for ambition. There's no risk for success. David Yates just gives us a very safe, but well-made 2nd part and respectfully final chapter to the Harry Potter franchise. I just didn't feel the emotion in the end. The tone an the visual all seems much more stirring and captivating. The story, especially, offers an eye full. Part 2 offers unexpectedly deep, perspective-altering and jaw-dropping surprises that'll throw you for a whirlwind of tears and sensible realization. Highly gripping, sentimental, and staggering levels of entertainment is brought to the big screen, and it's irresistible. Yet, the movie disappointingly doesn't go beyond it's comfort zone for success to achieve something spectacular. It just satisfies. The ending, as it did follow the book, is lazily executed and mistakingly ignores the small, reoccuring and culturally mirculous elements evident in each of the previous 6 films' conclusions. Instead Yates justified his ending on the book's. His job is to satisfy the books needs, but also the film's needs and especially in that area of delivery. As a conclusion it needs to reminisce, bring full circle, and revisit the visual elements of the previous films or else those elements meant nothing in developing any form of matter in the story visually, since they are there for the sole purpose to give the Potter universe it's final scene signature. It's how you bring together and conclude a series of films in a complete manner. But David decides to ignore those things and make the ending just fine. But for the biggest, grandest, and most successful movie franchise of all time (despite Star Wars), it didn't do it justice.",

I wouldn't call myself a hardcore book purist, but I would definitely call myself somewhat of a purist. I'm all for change in the films as long as it makes sense and it works. For Yates' three other films in the series (Order of the Phoenix, Half-Blood Prince, and Deathly Hallows Part 1) I felt he made lots of changes from the books that were not needed and, well, ruined the films for me (Phoenix, Prince and Part 1 are my least favourite Potter films). It's odd, then, for me to still have hope for Part 2, when the last Potter film I enjoyed came out almost 6 years ago. But, alas, I was finally impressed. Part 2 is truly a wonderful film and a fantastic end to the series. The changes made either made sense to me, or were too small for me to worry about. The acting was top-notch. All characters who have always been in the films, though mostly in the background, received their \"moment\" here and many scenes garnered lots of whoops and applause from the audience. The whole battle was well-made, and this movie really made a fan like me proud to have stuck with the series for so long. However, there are some complaints I have. The movie is called \"Harry Potter and the DEATHLY HALLOWS Part 2\" yet the significance of the Deathly Hallows aren't given. In fact, it's never discussed that Harry's invisibility cloak is one of the Hallows! There is a little chat about the Hallows in the beginning of the film, and then they are never talked about again. There are also the \"emotional\" scenes. The main scenes in this story that are supposed to be sad are, without spoiling too much, the revealing of several characters' deaths, a look back at a certain character's memories, and a scene in the forest afterwards. Though this scenes were well done in the movie, they didn't have me close to tears like they did in the books. This is really the biggest problem I had; the movie didn't feel too emotional or touching. I was expecting my eyes to at LEAST get a little teary, but they never did. Another scene, in which a certain mother calls another character a very naughty word, felt rushed, which is truly a shame as it was one of the most hyped up scenes. Overall, however, I was impressed and I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. It truly is the first Harry Potter movie since Goblet of Fire that left me quite happy. I will forever miss this series and will miss waiting and getting all excited for a new book and, now, a new movie. JK Rowling and the cast and crew of the movies have truly given me a wonderful childhood and a marvelous 10 years. Thank you.",

Now to the parts that I didn't really like. Fred Weasley and Lupin's death.They died in a very anticlimactic way. It wasn't as sad as it was supposed to be. These two are important characters. They just showed their dead bodies and that's it. Another thing is that Malfoy, Hagrid and other supporting characters didn't appear that much. The epilogue is something that I have mixed feelings about. It was in the book and I think it gave the film makers a hard time. The cool thing about the epilogue is seeing how the characters grew and seeing their children going to their same school. The not-so-good thing is that the actors looked silly. The boys (Harry, Ron and Malfoy) looked like normal adults but the girls looked almost the same. Hermione looks like she didn't even age. But the epilogue and other minor bad things didn't ruin the film for me. Harry Potter and Deathly Hallows Part 2 is great film and a good and satisfying conclusion to the series.",

A lot of it impressed me: It starts very strongly, deliberately slow to build toward the climactic battle, those early scenes are well written and acted, and watching Bellatrix-Hermione was a treat. But from then I found it hard not to be distracted by the choices the film-makers had made; powerful moments from the book don't seem to have been realised as well in the film. There are a few examples of this but the biggest is Voldemort's eventual defeat; the most important scene in the entire series, and he's gone, with a whimper, not a bang. Carrying the film through are two brilliant performances from Daniel Radcliffe (easily the best he's been) and Ralph Fiennes, this is their film. So much so, that all the other characters feel a bit pushed to the side; subplots with Ron and Hermione, with Luna, Neville, Draco feel rushed and unimportant. However, the films strength lies in its share of emotional moments, and all the big ones are well realised on-screen; I was a blubbering mess. This is still an excellent film, it looks amazing and is really well acted and mostly well scripted.

David Yates, being director for the fourth time in the saga, delivers to the public, fan or not, an admirable quality of outcome after having led the work with care in the previous films he directed. Proves to be a director of intelligent vision, placing each element in its quantity and the right times. In Part 1, there is a further development in the drama of the characters and their internal conflicts, and the plot to prepare the key to the end, but without having even a little in the moments of action. Now in Part 2, the fastest pace exciting and gives a greater focus to physical conflicts that the previous film, dramatic but also the emphasis needed to excite the viewer. In the plot, Voldemort got the Saille wand in order to become invincible. However, it gets weaker every piece of his soul that is destroyed by the protagonists. With his army of Death Eaters, he initiates an attack on Hogwarts, to prevent them and are able to destroy the last Horcrux. Harry, knowing his anger, struggles to find and destroy them in time, and finally have the final showdown with his nemesis. With the battle taking place in school, Yates once again follows the right, not making a final showdown full of explosions in an action whose purpose is just the visual impact, but an epic battle that although, as is the thrill of the moment truly is: a sad and gloomy. The soundtrack by Alexandre Desplat, who repeats the good work of the previous film, highlights this issue. In the technical issues, the film is not anything to duty. On the contrary. The treatment of visual effects, the aforementioned soundtrack, photography of Eduardo Serra, who also repeats his job well, the beautiful art direction and makeup too, providing a great result to the elves, and also in the epilogue, making a characterization of compelling characters. All this in a high standard of quality. The performances don't deserve any least attention. The saga has always been privileged to have an amazing cast, and now it's all about the movie where they are in the spotlight. Daniel Radcliffe has his best time and leads admirably. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are also more than worthy of recognition. Matthew Lewis has a good time favored by a more mature Neville. Alan Rickman, but doesn't appear too long, the scene offers a spectacle of the memories of his character. Ralph Fiennes Voldemort embodies a violent rage and consumed by fear. Helena Bonham Carter is also present as Bellatrix Lestrange insane, having featured in the comic scene of the invasion of Gringotts Bank. Also noteworthy is the actress Maggie Smith, with her surprising role of Professor Minerva McGonnagall, leading the defense of Hogwarts. It is gratifying to see the set of all such work carried out with competence resulting in something so admirable, that perhaps only small by not giving proper emotion in some of the killings, where beloved characters go, and also to explain some details left out that possibly confused a bit by those who didn't read the books. That won't be very harmful, but care about those details could be higher. However, the successes speak much louder, but contribute to the deserved outcome of this phenomenon that marked the many and surely will continue checking, because even with the sad farewell, the saga is not dead, nor die in the hearts and memories of thousands.",

What a ride it has been growing up with the movies, starting when I was 6 and ending as I am 15. When I hadn't seen the movie, I couldn't possible have imagined a childhood with Harry Potter, and now, 10 years later I cannot imagine what it would have been like without him. I'd like to thank everyone, who helped every HP book come to life, EVERYONE! Also, don't think I'm forgetting Jane K. Rowling - the person responsible for this epic saga's creating. I am forever grateful to her for that.  I give this movie 10 points, without doubt, but with also great sadness about the saga coming to an end. I understand it had to have ended some time, but still, I am pretty emotional. Like I did a marathon of 7 HP movies before going to the cinema to watch DH2, I would like to to in the future. I suggest you do the same :). Good luck to everyone in their future endeavours, whom I also thanked, and I will most certainly miss the characters!",

Getting to the end is wicked fun, and the director rushes us headlong into the action without much ado. I must admit that upon seeing the movie a second time, plot development takes a back-seat to the action scenes, but who really cares? When you get right down to it, all we want to see is Harry and Tom facing one another with wands in a duel to the death - and we are not disappointed in this respect. There are some surprising face-offs between villains and heroes in the final film, and they are worth seeing more than once.

Director David Yates and screenwriter Steve Kloves do exactly what they have done with previous installments; which is to move the film along as fast as possible whilst using as little expositional dialogue as possible and simultaneously dumping anything from the books that had any real character deepening qualities, ( Dumbledores dark past is completely sidestepped) or emotional clout, and leaving it cruelly flapping on the cutting room floor like a confused, suffocating trout. The battle of Hogwarts looks, well... pretty crappy, with Yates attempting to ape shots from Lord of the Rings and failing, despite having a much bigger budget to work with.Oi!  SAY WHAT?! Uh Huh! No **** Anyway, I can't be bothered writing anymore about this movie as it doesn't deserve it. Piss off Harry Potter, seriously. Yeah okay the books are fun and the movies are WHATEVER but does this crap really deserve to be the overwhelming super fart franchise it has become? NO! So much is better than this: looking at a wall for example, certainly a more wholesome experience than being forced to sit through either of the first two movies. Scratching your eye, easily as much fun as watching Harry Potter 5, fa show! Funny story: I actually farted earlier and it reminded me of Daniel Radcliffe's acting when R-Pattz died in HP Sause 4, what a stinkyness that was, jeez, in fact pretty much anytime Radcliffe had to really emote in a scene he failed miserably, though he did get less crap, but in the end he was still crap. and he knows it. The other two actor-children-people-things? Crap. Oh! Pushing a granny down the stairs, that's probably more fun than all the movies combined actually, and that's free to do, and only takes a second, AND you don't have to sit through twenty odd hours of crappy child actors pretending to actually like the crappy movie they're acting in yet all the while being glad they are who they are, not just because they're richer than most of us, but because they don't have to be us and not be in Harry Potter like we aren't, and have to pretend to everyone else that they like the movies everyone else likes such as Harry Potter, which thay actually think is only okay and not the second coming and would probably rather go down to the park and do an outdoor activity if you asked them, or even just do something else, like say....waterboarding themselves! Transformers is crap too, and loads of other stuff and whichever the latest tight wearing super ninny movie about a dude who got some powers through no fault of his own but was then able to pooh through peoples minds and travel back in time and become his own anus or his planet would explode or whatever even though he a bit socially awkward cause of their differences just like all of us are, awww, is. IRON CAPTAIN THOR FARTS 4: The secrets of the Teenage Mutant Ninja prostitutes! Its all the same! HuuuuuP! I actually am a Harry Potter fan, believe it or not, but I think this previous 'stream of consciousness' shows just how apathetic I was towards this movie and it got me thinking about whether artistic movie tastes are perhaps cyclical and.....well I don't know, originality might become fashionable again, probably not though so.... Johnny Depp I'm seriously annoyed at you too, make a good movie would ya?!.....aw WHATEVER Harry GO AWAY!!!

But I did think this movie was very good, almost better than the book in my opinion, mainly because I did not enjoy the 7th book that much. But the movie added a lot too the whole entire Hogwarts invasion sequence, and it made it much more action packed and much less of the 'going to class' act that has been there since the first movie. I thought that the acting was great, but not exactly very noticeable, but the real standout is the way the story was expanded. In truth, not much happens in the second half of the 7th book compared to the other novels, but the director was able to include many scenes that were not from the novel to make the movie MUCH longer. The battle between Voldemort and Harry at the end felt extremely epic, even though it felt a bit strange that Harry even stood a chance against him (17 year old boy deflecting spells from the greatest wizard of all time?). Overall, i felt that the movie was very good, and while it was not quite as good as the Prisoner of Azkhaban, i felt it deserved the 9/10 i give it.",

Daniel Radcliffe is just to many times on screen and to long which leaves Hermione, Ron, Fred, George, Molly, Arthur, Bellatrix and everyone else somewhat in the dark. Vendettas being fought out to the death between aurors and death eaters, Voldemort battling hes former teachers and mentor, Slytherin rejoining the great battle, Harry's final words against Voldemort, asking him to try to feel sorrow and regret and much much more like these events are left out in this movie.

HP and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 was fun, enjoyable and an entertaining closure to a long series. Did the film makers need to split the 7th HP book into two movies? Definitely No. but the film makers did pull it off, it wasnt perfect, nor was this the best Harry Potter movie but the film does work, despite some of the drama falling a little flat and for a few unintentional goofy moments.

It also excels artistically with the usual good performance from all our stars and a brisk screenplay that narrates the bombastic plotline with relative ease. Being the finale, it would have been pleasing if a bit more screen time was given to many of our secondary characters and most of all, a lengthier epilogue would have given it a better conclusion.

I was moved at the point where the professors use their wands to cast a protective veil over Hogwarts, and the light show when Voldemort's army attacked it was spectacular. I actually think the cuts were very judicious, and made for a cleaner narrative. Seriously, how would Dumbledore/Grindelwald's backstory have added anything?

Overall i would give this 8.5 not 10 simply because i have read the books and the film did not give credit to some of the characters. For example Bellatrix Lestrange, she is made into some top deather witch who is a really powerful witch in the books but looks nothing special in the films because all she does is get killed by Molly Weasley. In the book she fights hermionie, ginny and luna all at the same time then molly comes in, they should have done this in the film, it would have been one or two minutes at the most. The same with Voldemort, ok the fight scene between him and Harry is TEN TIMES BETTER than in the book, but Voldemort doesn't look powerful to people who have not read the book, it doesn't show him fighting Kingsley Shacklebolt, Minerva Mcgonagall and Horace Slughorn at the same time then blowing them away with a force explosion when he sees Bellatrix die. Then Harry fights him. This would have been added a max of 5 minutes to the film but would have made it so much better. Should of shown Remus and Tonks dying, and Fred dieng, but it did add things that weren't in the book. Neville on the bridge was interesting and exciting to watch.

I have read all the books and seen all the movies. I will say this: As with most adaptations, the books are better. But the books are not perfect. Rowling is not Kurt Vonnegut or Ernest Hemingway. She wrote clunky, workmanlike prose and relied unnecessarily on Deux Ex Machinas to drive the plot forward. There were a lot of unimportant, boring plot-lines in the books that the movies, mercifully, spared us of (like the stupid SPEW storyline). Beyond that, it is ridiculous to assume that film critics would review a film based on a series of books would negatively review the movie for divergences from the book. Film narratives and literary narratives are very, very different. Supposed ignorance to the books is irrelevant. What works on a page doesn't always work in a film. For instance, probably the most drastic change from the seventh book to the eighth movie is the final showdown between Harry and Voldemort. A very brief, yet powerful ending in the book is stretched out and elaborated on significantly in the film  The reason for this is simple: You simply cannot follow an elaborate, tense, series-long narrative leading up to the final showdown and have it last all of 25 seconds. Probably above all else, for a bunch of book-devotes, you all seem painfully ignorant of Rowling's hands-on approach to making changes. She had final approval. So who do your really hate?",

This film is no different as he searches and contains a tight grip on the plot and action whilst twinning personal character development and authentic special effects to produce a rocket fulled ride of wizards and witches in search of retribution , absolute Power and Justice. Yates's grounding in reality is where the later Potter's find their feet in series but also in British cinema as a whole. His choices to use a pallet of strained colour and a  dark looming overcast perfectly captures the situation in the plot and the audiences realization that the legacy of Rowling's Potter is at an end and for most cases the audiences childhood. No true Potter fan can be one hundred percent pleased and so with a sly niggle I must confess a deep regret at the filmmakers choice to not deal with the small matter of supporting characters outcomes so tamely. Especially with How they captured the beautiful Horror in the others through characters such a Sirius Black. And yes they divert from the books in a small way.

The first part was for me much better than this second part which, as someone said before, was soulless and hollow. Luckily for the crew I can't award less than a seven because the book is so good that the film managed to be very entertaining, possibly Gringotts being the best scene. Finally I think it was a good idea to split the film in two and I still think that both lacked a few necessary details from the book.",

      "text": "The eighth Harry Potter film, summing up the events of the last third of the Deathly Hallows novel, has arrived in theaters. I saw it in 2-D at the midnight showing, and I can say that it is easily the best novel adaptation since The Lord of the Rings series. The writing does justice to the novel, the action is great, and it's a fantastic piece of cinema that should definitely be given some academy awards. The film picks up exactly where the last one left off, and features Harry, Ron, and Hermione as they search for the remaining Horcruxes. As ever, the acting is not the film's strongest point, but characters like Neville, Snape, and McGonnigall give the best performances to date in the series. There are quite a few funny moments, mostly due to the writing, which again is the best to date in the series (save maybe Prisoner of Azkaban). From the get-go,   the action scenes are awesome, and the effects are great. Many casual Potter viewers who have not read the books will likely enjoy this final Potter more than the previous few, which were mostly expositional and had little action. The director also nails the drama sequences, with Alan Rickman pulling off the final revelation of Snape superbly. I would have liked there to be a bit more \"cool down\" at the end, as the film seems to end a bit too early after the end of Voldemort.",

When it came to the books I felt that the final book lacked the punch the others had with no overtly moving moments apart from the Snape reveal which seemed rushed in the book. The film on the other hand takes the gravitas developed by 7 movies before it and improves upon the words created by Rowling with a punchy, emotionally charged script by Steve Kloves. Daniel Radcliffe finally lives up to the title of Harry Potter as he carries the viewer through the last 2 hours totally invested in the challenges he has ahead of him. However the clear winner in this film is Alan Rickman as Snape who infuses his scenes with an air of contrition and regret making one of the main montages of the film incredibly moving. If the last film has a flaw its the under use of characters like David Thewlis' Lupin and Robby Coltrane's Hagrid while awarding too much time to original characters such as Kelly Macdonald's Grey Lady. Oh, and Emma Watson was boring......again.",

The plot is fairly close to the book and it is a great plot with action-packed scenes and great entertainment.  The acting was great too and so was the script. The problem with the movie however was the ending. The ending was a major letdown for me as the movie's ending was far less epic than the book's ending. While the book had an emotionally charged ending that had a nice not to end the series the movie ends not as well witch greatly dissapointed me. The developers should have gone with the book's ending for it was far more better than the ending they had but other than the dissapointing conclusion the movie is still worth watching. Overall, Harry Potter is a great film that is worth watching, this is a definative improvement over the 5th., 6th., and the first part of the sevent book movies. Potter fans should not miss it but they might be dissapointed by the ending.

Harry, Ron, and Hermione skip Hogwarts on their last year to go in search of the Horcuxes that Dumbledore had left behind. He gives them three objects to help them. At the end, it leaves you with the greatest thing you'll ever know is love, and that the people who die are always with you. That's important. It's an epic end to the best selling series, and original as anything i've ever read or seen. You could argue if it's true to the book, but not all things make it into movies, and you shouldn't give a bad store if it didn't include your favorite scenes. The acting is even better than before, as the kids are all grown up. Daniel Radcliffe has potential to be an Oscar-nominated star one day, as well as Emma Watson and Rupert Grint.   To be honest with you, I cried so incredibly hard that I left 10 minutes early while my friend was still in the theatre. It's an amazing movie. The fact that Voldemort finally is killed is sad to me, as that means it's the end of an era. Let's not forget we can visit Hogwarts anytime in our hearts:) That sounds corny, but it's true. What makes it so good is J.K. Rowling herself. She has created a whole other world that contains numerous sub-plots and truly good motives. Neither one can live as the other survives,, is a true statement to the film. For the first time we actually get to see Snape's love for Lily. Dumbledore when he's dead. All of things that stand out are brought by emotions and actions. It can stand on its own movie legs, because this is a great movie. The only thing I didn't like was the epilogue, but that's just my opinion. It's got everything in it. From the whole 7 movies to this one, there's deep underlying roots in the story that's hard to explain in a short amount of time. Tom Riddle, his mother, and the Gaunts finally play a part in the film, as well as Gringotts and Hogwarts to the extreme. As we look at the castle being destroyed,and people dying, it marks the end of a chapter. It also ends the brilliant battle between Potter and the Death Eater's. I was said Hedwig died though. The true message is so nice and sweet. How the people you love will always be there with you. While other people may not like it, I found it to be amazing. Nothing short of oscar worthy. It may be fantasy, but who cares? A-.",

      "text": "Summary: Movie should have been longer and in 2D Plot: The film hinges on the final battle between death eaters and other wizards. Hogwarts is the center of all action. Death and destruction is no longer discussed in background. You literally see the beautiful castle, Hogsmeade and Gringotts being ripped apart and people die. Let me stop with that. Special Effects: The film has been shot in 3D and, as with its prequels, the final episode boots really good CGI. Apparations, flying broomsticks, dragons, giants, slithering snakes, magic - everything is thrown at the audience in the two hour running time of the movie. And its all so beautifully interwoven that you end up applauding their physics rather than cringe thinking about their improbability. Cast: The main stars need no introduction. I guess this series was blessed, for they managed to complete production of eight movies with almost the same cast as they began. So in order to review the casting I need to go back in time - I guess it is unnecessary. I do not think we are going to get a more fitting description of Harry or Ron or Hermione. The only gripe is that we get to see less of some favorite characters (like Hagrid for example). Performance: The lead characters have done good. Not just in this movie but the entire series. Kudos to the kids who dared to spend the most crucial years of their lives to entertain us (yeah they definitely got a handsome pay in return) and have been keen to learn from day one to get their acting skills honed. Of the others I would always rate Alan Rickman's portrayal of the complex character of Snape as a cut above the rest - it was like a character written in the book come alive. Evanna Lynch also cast her character (of Luna Lovegood) with charm. Helena Bonham Carter will forever be remembered as the sneering Bellatrix Lestrange.

This movie is the perfect reward for all of us who have followed the series through both the books and movies. While Part I focused primarily on setting up the story and developing the characters, this one focuses on the payoff. Here, it's basically one action scene after another, and that's okay because we've had enough time to get to know the characters. By this point, you care about the characters, so the focus isn't so much on the spectacular effects as it is the characters that surround it. That's what all summer movies should strive to do, but this summer, only Harry Potter has bothered to do so, and what a treat it is. If you've followed the series, get ready for the most exciting movie of the summer. If you're new to the series, go by Blockbuster and have a Potter marathon. The movies you watch might not be great, but it will all be worth it once you get to this spectacular end.",

I felt that David Yates has got better and better with these films since he took as over as director with Order of the Phoenix, and I truely fell that his work with Deathly Hallows part 2 puts him up there with the best directors of the industry, in my opinion anyway. It got so many things right, the genuinely epic and emotional battle for hogwarts, the fight between good and evil, the story of Snape and so much more. However I dont think it got everything right, for example the whole story of Dumbeldor felt a bit under developed compared to the book. Its not perfect but I still give it a 10 because of everything it gets right. The actors seem to all be at their best for the finale with Ralph Fienes as Voldemort giving the best performance for me, the soundtrack is mind blowing and the special effects are stunning as always.

Plus it had more 'Magic' if you get what Im saying, even without there full cast. Percy Jackson I believe and I actually read all the Percy Jackson books, they made a better movie. Whats wrong with Harry Potter, the acting is less then good. Why do critics praise these movies, Im almost 95% sure non of them have even picked up the book.

The film is under the fine direction of David Yates, with the best acting ensemble ever brought into a film series (boasting for the three leads and Alan Rickman's performance), the visuals are spectacular (as always), the set designs are amazing (as always), the music is magical (Alexandre Desplat really delivers what we need to hear).

Even it's one of the best science-fiction movies of all time (also talking generally) After a middle disappointing Part 1, the final one comes with more energy, passion and chemistry of the cast. Emma Watson looked terrific even though her participation was a bit less. Makes nostalgia know your favorite characters are leaving the saga, but with an unique and masterpiece deliver.",
