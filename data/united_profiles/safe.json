      "text": "Navigating between the Chinese Triad, Russian Mafia, corrupt NYPD members and an equally corrupt NY City Mayor's office, Stratham is either befriending or fighting with one or all four of the groups.  The movie is very predictable, but it was hard not to like it.  Stratham is a very capable action anti-hero here, though his character's back story is ludicrous.  The villains are all pretty stereotypical and mostly decently acted (with the exception of Chris Sarandon's gay mayor, who did not need to be gay and was was not a good casting decision -- totally unbelievable).  The sidekick little girl is cute and effective in her role.  It almost had the feel of a Chinese or Korean gangster movie, except the story just got too convoluted.  The main story line is preposterous, with the math savant child, the Triad's need for her in the U.S., then the dual safe exchange involved in the main plot payoff.  So when the story is this awful, but the action is real and pretty well filmed, how you rate it depends entirely on how much you like action movies. They are my guilty pleasure, but I like them better when they are not so contrived.  People who rate this movie poorly don't like the genre. Those who rate it highly are perhaps too enamored with the genre to be objective.",

For instance when I watched Killer Elite I went into it hoping for some competent action and Robert De Niro hamming it up as he likes to do from time to time. Because I went in expecting exactly what I got out of it, I was in the end, thoroughly entertained. However despite my expectations being incredibly low I just couldn't shake the feeling that Safe was missing something. Safe as a movie is all about chaos. the chaotic nature of the New York underground, where the film starts is compared with the underground crime families the film is based around. As people start killing and losing money in equal measure everything turns into chaos. That being said the chaos feels really scripted, as if someone is pulling the strings on one of the fasted puppet shows ever made. A fight emerges when expected, a tense conversation ends in bullets firing in the most predictable of ways. It's all designed to be exciting but if anything it just feels safe. It's a heavily mapped out action film with no room for original thought or a detour from whats expected. It ends neatly, the action is relatively well handled in a seen that before kind of way, and lots of people die. It's everything an action fan could want but somehow I just wanted more.",

It features some nice brutal action and a surprisingly intelligent relationship between a hero and a little girl he is protecting.  The movie does, admittedly, take too long setting up the situation before the two meet; I'd estimate a solid third of the movie, which is a tad annoying since it is all a series of flashbacks.  There is also a distinct lack of action in this opening chapter as well, despite a high amount of tension, enemies being forged in a series of rather heated moments.  When the action comes, however, it is engaging and energetic.  The reason for all action sequences is generally clear, and this helps the audience connect with the situation in the movie.  Additionally, when Statham engages in a fight scene, he not only pulls a convincing performance of anger and fury, but also a clear look of desperation, as he is on a personal mission to keep this girl safe and free.  And that brings me up to another point:  I also appreciated that Statham's character is helping this girl on his own accord, for understandable but non-sappy personal reasons, versus some cliche reason, such as being a mercenary, or her being the daughter of some VIP.  And the ending of the movie does leave one with a reasonable amount of satisfaction; if there is a sequel or not is pretty much unimportant.  As an action movie, it's enjoyable - the gunfights are tight and the shoot-outs/fight sequences are very well choreographed and blocked.  My only serious complaint is that the cinematography often has the camera too close in on the action; a common problem with today's movies, and still annoying, but not the worst I've seen.",

The man really has the action junkies raving and each film is better than the last, but even he has a hard time making Safe worth watching. Former New York City Police Detective, Luke Wright (Statham), has lost his job, his family, and his respect. He's down on his luck and on his way out, when he finds a lost Asian girl in the subway. That girl is Mei, a numbers servant from China, who has been kidnapped and forced to work for an organized crime syndicate. As it turns out, Mei is holding a secret in her head that the Chinese, Russians, and even the New York City Police are willing to kill for, so when she runs away all hell breaks loose. The story here is actually pretty solid and Jason Statham is once again terrific, playing a deep character with a great back story. Had this film expanded on the story and flashed back to the past, it may have been a lot better, but as it was, Safe quickly turns into to one big chase, with lots of bullets and bodies. Newcomer Catherine Chan plays Mei and she was horrible. This girl has been kidnapped and seen horrors that most of us couldn't even imagine, yet she's always stone faced. She is emotionless and clearly using a fake accent, making her performance dry and full of mumbled lines that do nothing but confuse the audience. Jason Statham gives his usual high energy performance, with amazing moves, and terrific one-liners, but without any support, in a film that goes from one chase to another, it really is just a wasted effort.",

      "text": "I found 'Safe' to be a competently made action thriller that fully lives up to it's name; the film plays it way too safe. Sure, Jason Statham delivers a surplus of ass-kickings and there is plenty of violent invention on display (I found a scene involving the use of a bottle as a silencer quite original) and I'll admit that I enjoy watching a bad-guy have his trachea broken. But violence can only go so far in entertainment and at some point a storyline and characters surface that can't match the focus placed on the action scenes. I would say that 'Safe' is a perfect cookie cutter example of such problematic action films. What I really was interested in was watching the relationship between Statham and Chan unfold, which it never did, and I couldn't help feeling bad for James Hong, who seemed horribly miscast as a chinese gangster. Give 'Safe' a chance if you're into mindless action devoid of any meaning. I however, have interests that lie elsewhere.",

It had a good enough story to fill in between the drama. I don`t understand how people go into a movie like this expecting some kind of deep story.",

Something about a homeless kick-boxer saving an asian girl and then wanting to get 30 million dollars. I don't get it.",
