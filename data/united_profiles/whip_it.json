But recently a friend of mine had the dvd and we watched it and I was really glad I did. Loved it. Well, to an extent. The story was pretty good, a unique subject that as far as I know it's the only movie really to talk about it. And it actually got me legitimately interested in roller derby. The main characters were great as usual and the underlining themes of father/daughter and the obvious mother/daughter was well done. I guess I could say supporting characters lacked a bit and the love interest part wasn't too well done in my opinion, or well just made me mad I suppose. So anyway, 3.5 out of 5 from me.",

In addition, the Roller Derby is fun to watch because it has a lot of beating. I also loved the soundtrack. I think it\u00e2",
