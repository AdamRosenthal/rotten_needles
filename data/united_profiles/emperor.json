But I hoped for a miracle, that somehow that old dogfaced Texan could transform himself into the patrician MacArthur.  He couldn't.  It was simply awful.  But bad as that was, and it was really bad, it wasn't as bad as the script.  You were led to believe that the movie was going to be about MacArthur's administration of postwar Japan  a fascinating chapter in that complicated man's history and in Japan's, deserving of a historically accurate and well-acted movie, in the manner of \"Lincoln\" and Daniel-Day Lewis.  Instead, it is about the very beginning of that chapter, a brief period of a few days in which a subordinate of MacArthur's is tasked with ascertaining the guilt of Emperor Hirohito in the war.  As anyone who has read \"Shogun\" knows, Japanese emperors are figureheads who are revered but not expected to actually interfere with prime ministers  rather like the British monarch, but with a lot of pretense about his authority he doesn't really have  which damn near got him hung at the end of WWII.  Stretching that important judgment over a full-length movie might have worked if the history justified it, but it didn't.  So the makers went completely off on some romantic subplot, just as the makers of \"Midway\" did almost 40 years ago, evidently just to kill time.  When watching that otherwise estimable movie, I always have to fast-forward past the totally irrelevant melodrama.  This melodrama tries to introduce some relevant cultural history out of the mouths of the mooning melodramatis personae, but it's not enough to justify their presence. And then there is the ridiculously implausible drunken fistfight that the main protagonist, a one-star general, gets into because he's mooning over his lost girlfriend.  What an embarrassment.",

In reality this was not the case, many generals were reverted to colonel at the end of the war and Fellers was reinstated to the retired rank of brigadier general in 1948.  Also the film mentions he was awarded the \" Second Order of the Sacred Treasure\" but strangely does not explicitly state that this was an honor awarded by Emperor Hirohito.
