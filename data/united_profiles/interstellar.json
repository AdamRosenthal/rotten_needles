While there are a lot of positives for this movie, my only complaint would have to be the pacing of the story. There were a couple instances where I felt like the story was being rushed and that I had to just go along with what was going on at those points. Despite the movie being almost three hours long, I kinda wish it could be a little longer so that the story could progress more naturally. Other than that, I have no other negatives to mention.

Hans Zimmer\ufeff follows the director's effort in terms of scoring, which the musics sound more emotional, calm and creepy rather than the usual loud and powerful style; award-winning cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema did perfect job to present stunning, immersive and state-of-the-art visual effects of the space, wormholes, black hole and unknown planets beyond our galaxy.

Matthew McConnaughey is better, but whatever emotion or empathy the film generates, and there are some very moving moments, are purely due to the wonderful Jessica Chastain.

The next work of Christopher  Nolan arrives with much more strength than Inception, not only because we  jump from dreams to space, but also because is noticeable the consolidation  that reached this director. First is the setting of the story, the life of  mankind in the Earth has come to an end, although the interesting thing is  how Nolan shows it, from the point of view of a family. Here it is clear  the importance that acquires the human side in the story (which is also  present in Nolan's filmography), and this theme from the beginning to the  end is the protagonist. Some examples are the decision that Cooper has to  make, whether going to space but miss seeing his children grow or stay; and  the other one is probably the most heartbreaking scene of the movie, when  the protagonist sees the compilation video (astonishing performance btw).  This whole thing aims to evaluate human behavior, sometimes subconsciously  (Inception, Memento) and others rationally (Interstellar), but both about  survival instincts. Another amazing things about the picture are: the  visual effects, obviously, how the crew gather the current info and  theories about the aspect of a real dark hole; second, how it exhibits the  concept of relativity; and finally, the representation of time as a  tangible dimension. The film keeps you on the edge of your seat for nearly  3 hours, definitely nothing like what has been seen before.",

The main characters are sculpted well and detailed, and the characters are somewhat relatable and their wonderful acting gives a good sense of realistic emotion shown. Although the movie takes a bit to get started (the initial take-off sequence was decently boring) and a few of the characters fail to be interesting, the movie was overall fantastic. The ending sequence was one of the most incredible things I have ever seen in a movie since Nolan seems to think like me. Only difference being, I imagine someone looking across time pictured as a bubble, rather than a sprawling plane of individual time periods spread out in front of you. Nontheless, a must see. Especially if you liked Gravity, Contact, or any other space movies.

Also like most Nolan movies, its weaker parts are comprised of somewhat contrived and sloppy dialogue and questionable pacing. Some have expressed distaste with the amount of exposition as well, however I am less inclined to fault a movie with such large and far reaching ideas for packaging these ideas in a way the audience will at least to some degree understand. In a 3 hour movie you don't have the time to fully flesh out ideas naturally that may be completely foreign to the audience, thus heavier than normal exposition is needed to make sure the they are properly strapped in for the ride.",

I have grown to have great confidence in Christopher Nolan and his abilities as a director, and as a writer, not to mention his brother who helped him with this one. Quite ambitious to make a movie about a worm hole, even more so that the human race depends on what is on the other end for survival. My mind was blown, such a large scale with very rich and deep emotion for each character. The grandeur and the detail supersedes anything I've ever seen before.  Just when you think this movie is a little too tame, it flips you over. Isn't as structurally sound as some of his others, but this is flat out incredible. Only the best of the best can take these components and make a movie out of it. And not just a movie, a great movie. Worth a watch.",

First off, the visual effects are...breathtaking. It owes a lot to films like 2001: A Space Odyssey, especially some of the visual splendor that was on screen, but there was certainly some influence from lesser known films such as The Fountain. Some of the sequences in that film are almost perfectly emulated here, with some obvious changes, but the influence is obvious in that sense. Many of the sci-fi elements are also indebted to films such as 2001 and other far-reaching and technically brilliant sci-fi films. Sci-fi film wise, this one travels very little new ground. The score here by Hans Zimmer is perfect and truly served as a great sonic backdrop for the visual ecstasy that was taking place on screen. Interstellar is also a very emotional film, brought to life by strong writing and, in particular, strong acting. Matthew McConaughey is brilliant, as are Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Michael Caine, Casey Affleck, and Matt Damon. They all play great emotional roles here and it is hard to fight back tears at times. There are a ton of brilliant elements here contained here and the space visuals are king of that, but I do feel the story faltered at times. Namely, the ending seemed...cop outish. They kind of a held your hand a little bit at the end and pointed directly at what you needed to understand. It also ended very sentimentally and it could have gone in a far different direction and, to me, the ending seemed fake. Finally, there are some things that just do not make sense in terms of plot (plotholes, somewhat) that are not overly important because I barely remember them already, but all the same. In terms of science, it also seemed to try and go too far and get technical with science stuff, which was unnecessary and, largely, out of mental grasp, which was a bummer.",

There are some nitpickings here and there, some doubtful physical effect or weird character motivation, but it's still eons ahead of almost any sci-fi movie by scientific and logical cohesion. Most of the science-related elements are moderately explained, short enough not to break the suspense. It has it's tense and relaxed moments, it's bit of romance and humor, all mixed together in chemically precise proportions, giving an epic overall experience.

Christopher Nolan is usually known for such big and complex stories like \"Inception\" \"The Prestige\" and \"Memento\". He is currently the most ambitious director working today. Ambition can lie between being a great pro towards a film like this, or be a big con! The first time I saw it, it felt that the film was too ambitious in which it took over from the overall experience/pure enjoyment of the film. There was just too much to take in. But that's why the film is so watchable in my opinion. Christopher Nolan keeps you wanting more with a film like this. That's why the second time was a charm for me. I delved deeper into the film unlike the first and truly got an overall enjoyment out it. I love the space mission aspect of the film. I love the story behind this. I love the characters, especially Matthew McConaughay (Cooper). I love Zimmer's score. And I truly love Nolan's ambition! However Some characters felt completely under-used, like Cooper's son played by Casey Affleck. I love how they set up this character throughout the film, but I wish they could have used him more as a big character throughout the entire film. They just gloss over an interesting story element in which I think could have helped build the film especially for the theme of the movie. Also, Wes Bentley's character felt completely wasted and somewhat unneeded. Alongside that, the first 40 minutes of the film felt a little too slow to me. But once it gets into its space exploration, the film soars all the way up to its last 10 minutes (which I enjoyed more than most but still felt something missing). Other than that, I highly recommend this film for all film-lovers/film-goers! I know this review may sound a little too negative, but trust me, it's one hell of a ride that won't be soon forgotten! I give \"Interstellar\" and A!",

I have a few minor critiques, the film takes a while getting to the meat. I'd gladly trade a few minutes of farmville 2080 AD for a few more minutes of the grand adventure that fills the last 1.5 hours of the movie. A few things take getting used to, especially Cooper's robot companions who talk with no hint of a robotic voice and whose design and function looks a bit bizarre (they're like walking soda machines). On their voice, it's supposed to be a practical humanized crew-member but it's distracting for a few minutes. Our adventurers make a few absurd rookie astronaut/scientist mistakes, but that's to be expected to spice up and generate conflict in sci-fi. My primary complaint is in a few areas that are starting to become major problems in Nolan's story-telling, for instance his characters love to explain things at length, long after the audience has gotten on board with an idea. We saw a ton of this in Inception, where almost every shot in the final dream sequence was of someone explaining the rules of Nolan's universe. Interstellar has Dr. Brand explaining the multi-dimensional science of love for too long, Dr. Mann ruminating on the nature of humanity, and Cooper reviewing the rules of relativity over and over. Nolan needs to trim each of these sequences down to the bare information for the audience. And then there's...spoilers to follow...",

The story was one that I found difficult to follow during the picture but saw clear as day as soon as the credits rolled - and I marvelled at its complexity, its intricate depth of detail, its formidable ambition. I felt the 3 hours, which isn't a positive, but the time certainly isn't wasted.

Unfortunately, all of this explaining only served to distract me from the story, and much of what was said struck me as being overstated.  Besides!  A movie shouldn't have to repeatedly explain itself, right? Movie making is an art form; it calls for finesse and subtlety.  In a well-written screenplay, themes are developed gradually, almost imperceptibly, in small increments.

      "text": "I went into Interstellar without watching a single trailer, interview with a cast member or review -I went in totally blind. All I knew about Interstellar was that it was a movie about space and that Matthew McConaughey was the main character. This in my opinion helped a great deal because upon experiencing the movie I was blown away by the scope and depth of it. Much like Inception it's a movie that gets you thinking, regardless of whether the premise is totally possible or not. The entire story took a lot of concentration to follow and I will probably see it again soon to try and figure out certain parts of it. Some areas of the plot seemed a bit weak, there were parts in which I didn't understand how something had actually happened and where things were actually going. The entire thing seemed like a huge space soap-opera with McConaughey's perpetual bond with his Earth-bound daughter being the glue that held the entire movie together. The script seemed a tad bit weak in areas with some lines seemingly written up by a 10-year-old. The movie seemed to hold the viewers hand in some areas as it practically attempted to spell out the most complicated areas so that the viewer could understand and keep up. By no means was it a perfect movie but it was a great one and it's ambitiousness should be celebrated. It tried new things and it was a thoroughly enjoyable 169 minutes, I'd recommend it to anybody!",

Interstellar is quite simply a stunning spectacle, but also achieves an unprecedented amount of characterization for each individual character whilst also using them as a platform to scrutinize humanity's greatest flaws, but also its greatest strengths, something which lends this epic a broad emotional range as well as amazing shots of the cold, bleak and beautiful desolation of space and other worlds.  These characters would have been nothing though without the great acting carried out by everyone, especially McConaughey, who has somehow gone from generic 2D 'pretty boy' rom-coms to bleak, apocalyptic sci epics with apparent ease, he manages to root the existential chaos of the barren future with very human roots, and lends a defiant optimism in a film which does bleak and despondent very well indeed.",

Those scenes with Matt Damon on that planet are very thrilling though also a little confusing because of Matt's character's ambiguous intentions. And that scene where his character gets part of the Endurance destroyed and Cooper attaches to the destroyed part is extremely well done. Hans Zimmer's score over all and particularly in that scene deserves high accolades. He succeeded to bring a totally new sound to the move, even though there were places where it reminded me of the extraordinary and his best in my opinion score of Inception. Loved that scene with those tall waves too. Loved the depiction of worm and black holes, especially that of black hole is so beautiful and mysterious. I wish they had shown more of it (see my comments next). The plot is quite complex. There is lot of science involved. And because of our limited understanding of that level of science at points it seems there are plot holes while there are actually not that many. And especially after he dropped into the black hole it all suddenly becomes so very confusing and at the same time so very away of the scientific theme of the movie before that. It falls in that metaphorical/philosophical genre. It's here where it has a lot common with Inception. Like Inception the movie had me thinking after it was finished, and require multiple viewing to grasp it entirely, which again is a triumph for Nolan, I believe. Acting is top-notch. Matthew was great overall, he nailed the emotionally scenes particularly. I have started to like the guy now. Besides him I think Mackenzie Foy also did a splendid job.",

Many may claim the movie jumps the shark towards the end, but considering throughout the movie how brilliantly it handles relativity, gravity, wormholes, and black holes, I can do nothing but appreciate the scriptwriters for trying something new. The movie isn't just a science-gasm, it also tells a deeply personal story between main character Cooper and his ever growing desire to be reunited with his family on earth. I won't spoil anything, but at certain points of the movie concerning relativity, my tears threatened to spill. Interstellar also boasts some phenomenal special effects that I dare say rivals 2013's Gravity in terms of scope. The movie is also paced excellently, never dabbling too long in each entertaining section. Finally the music by Hans Zimmer is incredible. I would consider this soundtrack to be among the best of all time because of how brilliantly it blends ambience, thriller, serenity, and trans dimensional. In the years to come, I will look back at Interstellar and acknowledge it as a defining chapter in space opera history and of the defining benchmarks for amazing films.",

For a movie that happens in space, its cinematography felt very constrained (the camera was usually too close to its subjects), but wide shots are beautifully done. The acting was more emotional than in the other Nolan movies, but most of the characters are stereotypes (working class hero, smart child that's supposed to be cute, wise old man, etc.) and the way they were portrayed was corny and simplistic. All of them could have benefited from more personality traits to be more relatable and realistic. But the biggest problem with Interstellar is the same problem in Nolan's work in general: the script is overly convoluted and hard to follow and relies too much on exposition dialog rather than telling the story with imagery. Not to mention it's at least one hour too long. Not a terrible film by any means, but in the hands of a more subtle and less self-indulgent director, it could have been the masterpiece it desperately wanted to be.",

If you are not grossly into the film, you will be confused. If you do not like to think deeper, you will end up feeling confused. I sat through this and was very into the film because it was a dazzling experience. The score by Hans Zimmer truly gave the space scenes a huge boost. The run time of this movie is roughly 2 hours and 50 minutes, or 3 hours if you really want to round it all up. I cannot explain very much because I will give it away if I do. Go watch this movie in IMAX 70mm and I guarantee you that you will enjoy the movie a ton. At the end of the movie, [Please watch film to know more] :)",

The plot took way, way too long to take off. I saw it with a friend a few days ago and was asleep for the first thirty minutes. I saw a few people crying in the theater when a character would die and I just didn't understand why. The actors had little to no chemistry and I didn't feel any kind of attachment to the characters like I have in previous Nolan films. Inception is one of my all time favorite movies, and I hear people saying that Interstellar was better, and maybe I missed something while I was sleeping but it came no where close.

Not sure HOW he maintained that tan after being on a space mission for years (yeah I get the relativistic time dilation but they were awake, in a ship in space for months according to what the dialog showed). Also not sure why they needed to launch from Earth in a huge multi-stage rocket to get the exact same landing craft up to the rest of the ship that they were later able to use to cruise around and take off from under its own power on a planet with 1.3 Earth gravities.",

Secondly, the CGI is flawless. On par with Gravity's CGI. Now, the story. It is extremely complex. I' not going to talk about it that much because it will spoil a couple of essential parts to the movie.

Honestly, though its still a really good film in what has been for Nolan a great track record. See this movie while its in theaters as this is one you don\u2019t want to miss. Although turn up your hearing aids for the first hour or so because Matthew\u2019s character has quieter whispers than Batman in the Dark Knight films.",

      "text": "Interstellar was the film I had anticipated most all year and after gathering my thoughts I've come to the conclusion that it's almost perfect. Christopher Nolan once again excels himself as a filmmaker and this is arguably his most ambitious work to date. Personally I thought the spectacle of Interstellar evoked the same sense of scale and wonder only previously achieved by Stanley Kubrick in '2001: A Space Odyssey'. Matthew McConaughey gives a solid performance and he carries the film effortlessly. He perfectly balances portraying both a hero you can root for and a Father you can relate to. And his relationship with his on screen daughter Mackenzie Foy is both touching and incredibly human. Anne Hathaway & Jessica Chastain are strong also and Michael Caine, David Gyasi & Casey Affleck are worthy mentions in supporting roles. There's another surprising addition also who's name I won't reveal. When their face popped up I was completely surprised. Visually it's jaw dropping and the cinematography truly captures the enormity of this film. And once again Hans Zimmer's score is absolutely stunning and it's just as integral as the visuals when creating the cinematic experience. However there are undeniable flaws and many would argue that the ending feels like a bow that's been too neatly tied. As a piece of filmmaking it feels like a battle of ambition versus logic. But as a cinematic experience it truly overwhelmed me and I'm intrigued and excited to see what direction Christopher Nolan's filmmaking career takes next.",

Anne Hathaway is something a curiosity as an unconvincing astrophysicist, but apparently gets the Nolan 'pass' from her previous work in \"The Dark Knight Rises\".

As in life, nothing is one dimensional, nothing is simply distant or simply close, nothing is done and dealt with. The \"bad guy\" is just a regular flawed man who unwittingly helps more than he ever could by being a good guy; love animates the characters' actions even when it is twisted. This is a deep and deeply moving movie that carries itself with great grace. Where it has to borrow it does so respectfully; where it has to bend realism it does so with narrative elegance and an eye on the deeper things.

The simplicity of the early scenes made the movie that much better because you could feel that some serious stuff was going to happen later on and Christopher Nolan was just teasing you with some early run of the mill exposition. That being said, the story line was pretty horrendous. The movie was 3 hours long, but it  felt unbelievably rushed. An epic story like this should have been a ten hour affair, seriously. It needs that much time in order to develop properly since the scale is so large and the story so dense. The transition between the exposition and the rising action was particularly awful. The way they present the 'premise' of the mission was down right bad. The movie just didn't flow like it should have, and there were lots of mistakes in the script. Some of the dialogue between the astronauts is also really terrible. They speak in astronomy buzz words that excited teenagers might use in a intro to space high school class. But despite the story, Its an amazing movie which deserves to be watched many times in order to experience the sheer awe of the special effects.

Matthew MoConaughey had an absolute great performance, with also some great acting from Anna Hathaway and Mackenzie Foy.

Despite an expanded category than now could have 10 nominations to account for big blockbusters like this, one of the best pictures of the year was not among them. Why? Interstellar is a great movie. It is the reason we go to watch movies. It isn't some popcorn flick you go watch to kill time on the weekends, it is a deep, epic space that you want to see opening night and it is that good. It has elements from everything, from the epic special affects and feel of space of Gravity, to a strong and heartfelt love story of a man and his daughter. It missed on some stuff, sure, some of the dialogue wasn't perfect and it wasn't as full of an ending as it could have been, but it did something very movies did nowadays, it aimed huge. It might not have quite measured up to its massive expectations, but it tried and you could feel it in an epic way you'll never get from a marvel movie, or even an Indie. This was a great movie, and this is how big blockbusters should be made. With passion and talent unmatched, Christopher Nolan has made something incredible. A classic.",

      "text": "Interstellar is truly a sci-fi epic like no other. To compare said film to '2001: A Space Odyssey' isn't just a disservice, but unnecessary. The films are almost nothing alike, simply sharing small plot elements. Also, Stanley Kubrick's vision of Arthur C. Clarke's sci-fi epic wasn't to ponder the philosophical questions that accompanied the story, but to make art, and art is was, and is. With Interstellar, Mr. Nolan set out to make his most personal and emotional film to date about love and time (time being a recurring theme throughout all of Nolan's films). But it's so much more than that too. There are no words to express the epic journey Nolan takes us on in the film, but needless to say, it's tear-jerking and emotional throughout. The acting is top-notch, especially McConaughey, who gives (I would say) his most emotional performance yet. But the actor who stole the show in a few scenes (one in particular, when they're on an alien planet) was David Gyasi as Romilly, one of the astronauts aboard the Endurance, their spacecraft. The musical score from Hans Zimmer is, without a doubt, his best and most influential work to date, helping drive the film's bold and breath-taking vision (the church organ helped significantly). The visual effects are easily the best to date as well, and of the year. To see a black hole created through visual effects in such a way, with pages theoretical equations provided by Kip Thorne (theoretical physicist, of whom's work inspired the film's genesis); what you see in the film is the most realistic depiction of a black hole, and even offered new insight to accretion discs surrounding the anomalies. But even everything else, from the alien planets to the Endurance, the visuals always look real. Then, there's the writing. I would definitely have to say this has some of the best dialogue i've ever heard in a sci-fi movie, and the script continually pours or oozes emotion, keeping the audience tethered to the film.",

His movies have repeatedly been original (which, among all the remakes, sequels, and reimaginings that are so prevalent now-a-days, is unfortunately quite rare) and Interstellar is no exception. It's a very unique film that touches on a subject that has somehow rarely been touched upon. Namely, the intricacies of how worm holes and time travel truly might work and how the human race might utilize them to aid in its survival. This movie doesn't need to rely on flashy special effects (though they are quite good). It doesn't need to fill each moment with action in order to tell a story (I'm looking at you Michael Bay). And it doesn't insult the intelligence of the audience by providing too much detailed explanations from the characters as to how worm holes and time travel work. There are a few scenes where they touch on the subjects, but Nolan assumes that his audience is at least reasonably intelligent and can not only understand the concepts by direct monologue, but also from inference by what's being portrayed on screen. There are moments which someone who is nit-picky might find to be far fetched, but this movie isn't targeted for such an audience. It's targeted towards those who can reasonable suspend their disbelief enough to catch the point the movie is trying to portray. In fact, the movie is less about the science and the theory, but more about the characters and that \"what-if\" factor. The acting is simply superb. I found my manly self holding back tears in one scene, and giggling like a fool in another. To this date, I have yet to watch a movie which Nolan has put out which has been anything but fantastic. He has built a reputation of one of the greatest Directors and screen-writers of our generation, and I'm personally glad to be alive to experience it.",

Matt Damon serves to real purpose in this movie, in fact most of the peripheral cast is useless and one note in this feature. Subtlety is definitely not Nolan's strong point as he sees fit to explain a lot of details in such a scripted and droll manner almost like people are simply reading off the cue cards. This movie is 1 1/2 hrs too long. The robots are really laughable and cringe inducing. I feel embarassed for Nolan especially the part where Hathaway's character gets herself into a jam due to stubborness and stupidity. That scene was really awful and the way one of the characters died was pathetic. Just watch this on Blu-ray so you're not forced to sit throught the whole thing. Collapse",

Visually, its one of the best looking films of 2014...in my opinion. If you want the full experience from this film, then I highly recommend you go see it in IMAX. GOOOOO SEE IT IN IMAX!!! TRUST ME!!!!",

Very much like \"Interstellar\". If that's your idea of a SF movie, go ahead. I actually hated it. Don't be fooled by Christopher Nolan's previous work - it's his worst film ever - or by the name of the physicist Kip Thorne in the credits (\"Contact\" was also based on his - and Carl Sagan's - work, and see what happened). Some examples of the movie's \"physics\": A) scientists send a robot into a black hole so it can send data back to them from BEYOND the event horizon, B) planets orbiting a dark black hole (and nothing else) are illuminated by sunlight (!), C) the gravitational pull of the black hole rips everything apart, except the astronaut's body (magic!). More importantly, the reason why all humans must leave the Earth? Well, there are dust storms like in the 1930s in the middle of the USA, and some particular crops are affected by diseases.

Nolan simply slingshot to infinite distance in movie making industry, although there were some problems in the script the important 169 minutes offer everything one would expect. now its time to do some review on the movie. its screenplay is spectacular, more than INCEPTION. its only in my view . script gives us the glimpse of brilliance and hard work done by the film maker. he touched Stephan Hawking's BLACK HOLE PARADOX, Einstein's THEORY OF RELATIVITY everything physics had to offer. the movie starts with a silent, just to build on. Matthew McConaughey has done a great job to do this role. after slight introduction of human crisis Nolan tries to enter deep into charecter who lost his job, wife etc. the main charecter then enters to a voyage of script !. humanity is facing blight , human raise is struggling to produce food. every nation shut down their resources. whole of a kind is trying to make food.  McConaughey stumbles into a secret NASA space station by the help of his daughter's GHOST story. now we get glimpse of suspense that script has to offer. he took his chance there to rescue mankind ,joined with some more scientists which include Hathaway . they were trying to solve the problem with gravitational equation, another planet with life forms. before the expedition they select three potentially good chance planets and try to communicate. these hard knowing scenes may suggest little boring if you are not a fan of Nolan movies. story continues till they enter into each planet first one had nothing in it. next one produce more problems as it is conflicted with another scientist who has selfish nature and it all goes into third and most dangerous planet. meanwhile in earth already fourty something years passed. twist in the story happens when McConaughey  come to know about the fact that it was a sham, they were carrying life form to enhance new planet but not saving it . then the whole black hole thing comes all that drama sequence and then he fell into another five dimensional world where the rest of the story starts to reveal Matthew McConaughey gives his daughter secret to bend time and that is it . planet is saved then there is a glance into five dimensional world in future which was awesome to see. i was fascinated by thinking of growth of film makers in all these years. it is a must see movie.",

I had very high expectations from this movie considering all the talented people involved in it's production and thought that I would get to watch a film that asks some interesting questions and delves ito complex ideas, instead what I got was just another story about how love beats reason and science. Which in the hands of a more subtle director wouldn't have been so bad, but Nolan tends to make every character explain how he/she feels instead of just showing it. 90% of this movie is just expozition or characters holding speeches about how they feel which makes it very hard to relate to any of them. But the good visuals and great music makes this whole mess  pretty tollerable. Until the last 20 minutes at least. You really need to see to believe the black hole of stupidity that is the climax of this movie. Those were the most nonsensical 20 minutes I saw in recent memory. All logic and reason is tossed aside to make some lame speech about the power of love. I don't know what mind altering substances Nolan consumed when he wrote that ending  but it sure as hell it didn't fell like something the guy who wrote Inception and The Dark Knight would come up with. All in all: if you are someone who just want to watch a smart sci-fi movie or even a good film in general avoid this pretentious mess.",

For the most part the film is a lot of fun, creating a believable world that could easily represent humanities future, with some good acting and amazing effects the first hour or so of this movie was very enjoyable to watch. Then the downsides play in, one of which could have just been the cinema i was in but i have seen this comment elsewhere too, and that is that the music was so unbelievably deafeningly loud that you cannot hear key dialogue points and because of this draws you out of the story and leaves you feeling annoyed after any action scene turns up. My biggest annoyance with this film though has to be the ending, it seemed like Nolan was going more for a remake of 2001: A Space Odyssey and make an ending which is overly complicated and more of a Deus Ex than actually put in a decent ending to the movie. Overall i enjoyed this movie, but i believe it fell just short of being a classic by just a few odd decisions, in my opinion anyway.",

This gives a lot of creative license to Christopher Nolan, who progresses the story through creativity without ejecting audiences uncontrollably. The great thing about Nolan's approach in Interstellar is that we can't really say for sure he's right or wrong, because the movie operates on existing facts and theories in regards to space and time.  But what really anchors this movie is the sentiment of relationships - of how love is an immeasurable force that has yet to be quantified or measured in any meaningful way.  And, without using dialogue or narration, the \"5th dimension\" experience later in the movie is somewhat explained by the final seconds of the film (not a spoiler) - something I think people could have missed on a first pass.

This movie is the perfect example of a terrible script backed by money. The main plot is that the Earth is becoming inhabitable and humans are forced to find another planet to call their home. But what exactly is happening to Earth? There's no explanation anywhere in the movie, it's like \"hey there's some plagues attacking our crops and dust storms so we're leaving the planet\", that's all. Interstellar is full of plot holes. First, the only reason the protagonist goes to space is because some \"poltergeist\" haunting his house gave him the coordinates to NASA's facilities. By the end of the movie you'll find that the poltergeist is he in the future, in another dimension. So the whole sequence of events only happen because after it happened he could make it happen.That's nonsense. The hero enters a black hole, goes to another dimension where he could contact the past luring his old self into the space trip, and then appears near Jupiter floating all by himself and gets rescued by other humans.. A black hole is a colossal ammount of mass bound together by gravity, so strong that not even light can escape it. Anything that goes near it will be utterly destroyed. But scew science. Secondly, three people went to space, then suddenly another astronaut appears on the mission from nowhere just to die a few minutes later. Seriously, I don't understand this movie's mostly positive reviews.",

The script is a collection of dumb cliches about family and love guaranteed to rope in the multiplex crowd. The score is strident and bombastic. Etc. Interstellar is the exact OPPOSITE of 2001 in every way, on every level--a stupid Hollywood crowd pleaser appealing to both shallow sci-fi and video game brains, instead of a profound mockery of the pretensions of sci-fi and scientific rationalism itself in the face of the unknowable chaos of the universe in 2001. Kubrick merely used Arthur C. Clarke in order to make fun of his kind of enthusiasm for and overconfidence in human rational understanding. Interstellar is right down on Arthur C. Clarke's level. No wonder it will be a much bigger hit than 2001 was, since 2001 naturally truly baffled people when it came out, whereas Intstellar provides a sort of momentary sense of disorientation while ending Hollywood style in a dumb \"explanation\" of it all, not to mention ending with the idiotic combo of the hero completing his \"quest\" AND fulfilling the inevitable Hollywood \"love\" theme, all in one dumb gesture. Contrast that ending with Kubrick's deliberate total subversion of Hollywood, not just in 2001 but in every film he ever made. There was a reason Kubrick lived in London.",

There were some surprise cast members I had not known about and that was fun.  I sort of enjoyed the last hour, but it involved concepts way beyond my comprehension.  So I just had to go with the emotions the actions generated.  Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway are great as the two astronauts who are risking everything to save the human race.  Although, actually, earth is doomed and their Plan B would be to colonize another planet with embryos that are somehow supposed to grow into human beings.  Anyway, I have to say that when it comes to space movies, I enjoyed \"Gravity\" much more. And, frankly, \"Alien\" and \"Aliens\" are more my space movie cup of tea.  So suit yourself on this one.

      "text": "I saw Interstellar with really high expectations because 2 of my friends said it was amazing. They were right! The movie opens up with a segment about earth. It has basically turned to s*** and there are dust storms frequently. Not to mention the lack of crops and wildlife. Basically, as said by Michael Caine, \"Your daughter's generation will be the last on earth.\" Not a good sign. So Michael Caine's character asks Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) to take a long and dangerous journey into space in the hopes of saving the human race. The original plan was to bring everyone off of Earth and repopulate on another world. But that plan, as revealed in the movie, is not possible. So they are forced to go with plan B, which was to abandon everyone on earth and start a new colony with their frozen human embryos on their ship. But before that part of the story, they visit two planets. A water planet and an ice planet. The water planet is made entirely of shallow water and occasionally has cloud-high waves that sweep the planet and eliminate any life that may be in that area. So... Not the best place to setup a human colony because the original scientist who landed there was most likely hit by one of those waves as well as Cooper's third crew member. The second planet they visit is entirely made of ice and is very visually appealing to the eye. There, they meet another scientist who seemed so grateful to be freed. But, he turns out to be a selfish man because he abandons Cooper's crew and attempts to dock on their spaceship. He failed however, and wrecked their ship in the process. But Cooper manages to escape the planted with Anne Hathaway and manages to dock on the wrecked spaceship. But seeing that all hope is lost, he decides to take a chance and uses the black hole's force to propel her from the ship, but only her. He proceeds to enter the black hole and enters the time dimension where time is instead physical instead of figurative. From there he manages to send a message on his daughter's watch and they figure it out. He then escapes the time dimension and is luckily found by a team of searchers by Saturn. He then finds himself at Cooper station (named after his daughter) which orbits Saturn. He then gets a chance to see his daughter one last time, who is now at least 40 years older than him. Interstellar does have a very sad ending which made me tear up I have to admit. But overall, Interstellar is a compelling Sci-Fi movie with great performances, especially by Matthew McConaughey. 9/10 (Awesome)",

However what prevents it from being a masterpiece is the unnecessary length along with this film being covered in Nolan's fingerprints. Interstellar suffers some of these amen issues that Inception did with large points implied however the film can't grasp the full concept. Nolan tries his best to avoid exposition, but its inevitable. Some of his  characters were stale and seemingly there to just explain important plot points. Despite that however, I found this to be a very entertaining film, keeping me on the edge of my seat nearly the entire show.",

I will, however, touch on the two biggest ones, in my opinion, and both have to do with the conclusion of the movie so again, you've been warned. The first is the complete and total fail that is the time paradox proposed in this film, more specifically the 'bootstrap' paradox. This is based on the concept that critical content that the futures hinges on is actually acquired from the future itself. Of course, this theory is a farce but unfortunately many science fiction stories rely on it as its foundation. Theoretical physicists will disagree but they're just manufacturing job security (i.e. they're liars). I won't go into too much detail on the various examples of this paradox in the film but if you see it, it'll be painfully obvious which instances I'm referring to, as they point them out for you. The second fail is the inconsistency of time relativity, as they introduce it in the movie itself. It makes sense throughout most of the film... until the end, when Anne Hathaway somehow doesn't age. Nolan apologists will fabricate arguments to defend this or make excuses, just like they did in Inception, but the reality is that Nolan blew it here. She should've aged 51 years or more just like the rest of the people (outside of Matthew McConaughey, who was sucked into a black hole and of course survived). I mainly focused on the negatives with this review because those few negatives are what held the movie back from a perfect rating. If Nolan would've gotten out of his own way, this could've been one of my favorite science fiction films ever. Unfortunately, it was pushed back to the \"really good but not great\" category where so many other films reside.",

The final half hour is where the payoff comes and it's appreciated and touching but again, it takes far too long to get to that point. Chris Nolan is a fine director but even the best have to be told to re-think their approach some times and this was one of those times. \"Interstellar\" could've and should've been much much better than this.",

Despite its 169 minutes, it didn't seem long at all (if a film is well made, then the longer, the better) and it's resoundingly clear that Christopher is excellent both in getting fine performances from his actors and, along with his brother Jonathan, in writing scripts. What makes the film special for a sci-fi work is that he doesn't have to show any monster--nothing is truly more scary than humanity itself. This is a work that can combine an excellent explanation of the theory of relativity yet still show that the only things that truly matter are the relationships we develop in our everyday lives.

I mean, it's a fantastic soundtrack, but it's kind of hard to be in the moment when you can't even hear the characters' emotions!! The best example I can give *MAJOR **** SPOILER AHEAD* was when Dr. Brann (Brann? Brand?

The creators said it was because they wanted to make the emotions clear not through dialogue, but through the music.

That's the only gripe I have with this movie, other than a few obvious creative license uses like *SORT OF SPOILER AHEAD* someone surviving going through a black hole when they should have been crushed due to the gravity. In addition the CGI was STUPENDOUS. It really felt like it was actually filmed, not CGI'ed. On top of that, they hired a real astrophysicist to develop an engine to accurately represent a black hole or wormhole. That takes some serious dedication.

It seemed pretty clear from the start that Nolan was quite precious about this particular film and in hindsight... might have cost him a really great one. Despite Interstellar's stunning visuals, the film's screenplay never lives up to the same heights. Nolan puts a fair amount of effort explaining the science behind the mission aiming to salvage humanity, however the information seems forced and you begin to feel as if you're in a physics lecture, with an unconvincing lecturer. Zimmer's musical score is excellent and in combination with the visuals, really gives Interstellar the desired operatic quality as could be experienced in films such as \"2001: A Space Odyssey\". Nevertheless, the powerful score is often used to over-sentimentalize the love bond between Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) and his daughter, causing the film to feel sappy at times. The conclusion to Interstellar raises a couple of questions and the explanations provided aren't the easiest to swallow, however, what it does guarantee, is a great debate upon viewing and for that alone a film worth seeing.",

I honestly have a hard time telling good acting from great acting, so I'll say the acting is good enough for me to not have to suspend disbelief. The dialogue is interesting and the plot is compelling. The ending is a tad...unbelievable...but the rest of the movie is so good and so interesting that I'm forgiving the silly ending and pronouncing this a great watch.

Interstellar is simultaneously a big-budget science fiction endeavor and a very simple tale of love and sacrifice. It is by turns edgy, breathtaking, hopeful, and heartbreaking. It's an amazing achievement that deserves to be seen on the biggest screen with the best sound system possible. Nolan has crafted Interstellar as a movie theater experience. Watching it at home, no matter how good the sound system is, won't match. This is one time when the IMAX surcharge is worth it.",

In a vast universe, the plot follows a team of scientists scrambling to save mankind. The astronauts make their way to the stars through difficulties. In each ordeal, time amplifies the characters' mistakes and successes to unforeseen outcomes. Hans Zimmer's musical score augments Interstellar's sense of helplessness and curiosity to extremes. I watched this movie on my computer screen, but it would be best to watch in a home theater or in IMAX. This is due to the jaw-dropping, unfathomable presentation of cosmic visuals in the movie. Interstellar takes the spot as my second favorite movie of all time. It is without a doubt deeper and more ambitious than Christopher Nolan's Inception. This is not to state I didn't enjoy that movie. Interstellar, like Inception, doesn't fit well to watch on a Friday night. It's more of a Sunday afternoon type movie! Prepare to ponder Interstellar's mind-numbing themes & concepts for several days after finishing it.",

If you have ever studied quantum physiques or those theories you will just love the movie. If not then you might find the movie a bit too informative and sometimes dull. The theories explanation in the movie are not really understandable but that is a no problem hence their complex nature. Instead these theories are simplified as much as possible. It has an extraordinary and dramatic atmosphere of a planet Earth which is basically on the verge of destruction with all of the extras such as people dieing  from starvation, water pollution, wars, crimes etc but the movie instead does not focus on that but on a trip to outer space trying to find a better Earth in the form of another planet in order to save the human race. I like the movie, the atmosphere, the soundtrack and the casting. I do think though that the acting was a bit over dramatic at some points and a bit over emotionless on other moments. Pans and corny dialogues are included as usual with such movies. The conclusion of the movie is completely unexpected and I really enjoyed its ending! You should watch that movie!",

There are amazing scenes, like the cornfield chase scene and the water planet disaster. I do agree that this movie has flaws. Some characters are underdeveloped. Why is Cooper's son in the movie? He's just kinda.. there. The only use he has is to add conflict near the end. It's also odd how Murph holds a grudge on Cooper for so many years. Nobody would be that stubborn. Some of Cooper's crew is just kinda there, like his son. They are never developed. The guy with the beard dies when they reach the water planet and the black guy dies on the ice planet. They are never developed. The movie is more focused on story rather than characters. Even the story is flawed sometimes. For example, we hear about Cooper's wife once and how she died, yet she is never mentioned again. Don't you think she should be a bigger part of Cooper's life? At this point, I'm just nitpicking small things. The movie overall is amazing. Movies are about experiencing awe and wonder, and Interstellar does that well. The messages and themes in Interstellar along with the breathtaking scenes and the soundtrack make it one of my favourite movies of all time.",

It is about family, it is about our future as a human race, and it is about learning how to say goodbye. While some of its space physics have been questioned for legitimacy; the film delivers on so many levels. Its direction (Nolan), writing, casting, performances, cinematography, production design, effects, and music all make for a deeply immersive experience. Now if only we could see it in IMAX again.",

The Prestige, Inception and TDKR all had plenty of WTF moments (such as the crew formulating plans on board the ship rather than preparing in advance), sure, but you can forgive them because the rest is so good. Not so here. The story absolutely fell apart at the end for me and those moments I refer to can\u2019t be redeemed. The film could still have been saved if it looked spectacular \u2013 but to me it just looked really, really bland! The two planets they visit are feature the dullest looking vistas imaginable \u2013 endless sea and endless snow. The space exterior scenes were completely lacking in awe or majesty. The camera always seemed to cut away too quick. On the plus side, I enjoyed MMs performance and I really enjoyed the time bending aspects of the story when they visit the first planet. Overall this was a wasted opportunity.",
