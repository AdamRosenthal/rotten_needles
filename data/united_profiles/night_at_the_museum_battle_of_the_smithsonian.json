Stiller's performance is just forgettable - he doesn't do anything interesting - and Azaria's performance was the only mildly entertaining thing on screen despite the range of colourful historical characters available, who I don't think even did anything as I recall.

It did have it's funny moments, like the Jonah Hill and Ben Stiller scene, but most of the time, the humor was just stale and weak. I can't that this movie was just terrible, but it really wasn't good either. Overall, it's just a boring sequel.",
