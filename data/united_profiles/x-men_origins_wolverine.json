      "text": "I so wanted this to be brilliant, after The Last Stand being average. Well, this film is very average The film is filled with plot holes, like why the hate between wolvie and sabertooth? I understand, wolverine wanted revenge for his love, but if she turned out to fake her death, and died from a guards bullet with wolvie and sabey fighting weapon xi side by side, it doesnt add up to their hatred in x men 1. also, why wait 6 years to enact their plan? and when wolverine hears kaylas cries, then appears to save her, whys his shirt suddenly dissapeered? Gambit wasn't really needed during the last part. All he on the island did was save wolvies live once and see the kids go off. The way Wolverine was made to forget wasn't ridiculous. In the comics, another character (with similar healing abilities) got shot in the head by an adimantium bullet also, and they too lost their memory. The film did seem to key itself into the x men saga, what with cyclops, emma frost and xavier in the film, but it seemed keyed in a little too neatly. The actors played their roles pretty well though. Hugh Jackman, Liev Schrieber, Ryan Reynolds, great acting. Mr Reynolds' portrayal of Deadpool (my fave Marvel character) was pretty good, quipping and the awesome fight scene at the beginning. But once he became Weapon XI, with his mouth sewn up, it became a bad portrayal of the character. Nethertheless, this film has garnered a spin-off Deadpool movie, so we gotta give them props on that. It does seem a little too fan pleasing, giving us all these x men characters within this film, and a few of them seemed to be there just for the hell of it (The Blob, will.i.am and Domonic Monaghauns characters) It should've been better though",

      "text": "X-Men Origins: Wolverine is a seriously flawed film. The first fifteen minutes or so are really quite entertaining - a visually stunning and visceral title sequence with Wolverine and Sabretooth literally running through history, and fighting in the American Civil War, WWI, WWII and Vietnam, whilst being accompanied by Harry Gregson-Williams' suitably epic score. We then have a quick trip to Nigeria, where each member of the elite team of mutants Wolverine joins demonstrates their skills in a spectacular fashion whilst fighting a warlord and his henchmen. After this first act though, the film becomes drab and lifeless, poorly plotted and filled with cliche. The actors' performances are generally sub-par - Hugh Jackman attempts to get by on a variety of grumpy facial expressions, Lynn Collins is wooden, Will.i.am should stick to his music career, and Danny Huston isn't even worthy of being mentioned in the same sentence as Brian Cox, let alone playing the same character Cox so perfectly portrayed in X2. Ryan Reynolds and Kevin Durand are both entertaining enough, but in the film all too briefly, and a character with such fanboy devotion as Gambit deserves to be played by a much better actor than Taylor Kitsch. The only person in the whole cast who really impresses is Liev Schreiber, who develops Sabretooth/Victor Creed from the hulking, brainless henchman he was in X-Men into an intelligent, driven and genuinely frightening antagonist in this film. The film's screenplay, written by David Benioff and Skip Woods is truly woeful. No wonder the film feels so disconnected from any semblance of reality and the dialogue promotes far too many unintended snorts of laughter - the script resembles something a toddler scrawled with crayons. Added to this some rather wobbly visual effects, boring and uncreative action sequences and a truly terrifying cameo by a de-aged Patrick Stewart, X-Men Origins: Wolverine becomes a pretty terrible example of a superhero film. Hugh Jackman and director Gavin Hood (amazingly the same man behind the brilliant South African drama Tsotsi) have succeeded in making the most interesting character in the X-Men canon boring - we now know everything there is to know about the adamantium-clawed amnesiac's past, so he holds no more intrigue.

I felt that the film was just too rushed to begin filming this snooze and look what they did to Deadpool! Unlike the recent awesome Deadpool movie, Origins, however, was supposed to be a badass spandex-wearing anti-hero (with a mask) who has nothing to do with the entire X-Men crew, but then Deadpool started to go all grumbling and that's why things starting to get even worse. The plot was alright, but the CGI visual effects have run its course. I have nothing to say about Hugh Jackman's performance as Logan/Wolverine. I'm very excited that he nailed it through every segment of the movie. I hope he'll be fine in the now R-rated Wolverine 3 movie and finally sealed the deal on Wolvie's fate. Sucks to be this movie, but it doesn't need to be light, it just doesn't need to be polished, it needs a taste of excitement.

But no, we get a few minutes of Wade in the beginning, and a few minutes of Deadpool in the end. It seemed like a waste of talent from the actors that played all of the aforementioned characters. I believe it would have been so much better if they had just stuck to the central plot and the central characters: Wolverine, Sabretooth, Stryker, Kayla and a little more of Gambit.

But other than that the movie is ok hugh jackman did amazing as always but the thing I dont get is that wolverine and sabertooth are brothers are in this but in xmen they act like they arent even brothers I know he lost his memory but sabertooth didnt the movie really has flaws but you can enjoy it trust me. I also think the relationship between wolverine and silverfox are a better relationship than wolverine and jean.",

Origin stories are a necessary burden for superhero movies, but after starring in three X-Men movies, Hugh Jackman\u2019s Wolverine didn\u2019t really need an introduction. What\u2019s more, Wolverine has always worked best in comics as a high plains drifter of a character whose origins remain shrouded in mystery, even from himself. Still, someone decided the story needed telling, although presumably no one set out to tell it this badly.",

      "text": "I admit that I loved this film when it first came out and I even thought it was the best in the X-men series. However as I developed my critical thinking skills I had started to notice the problems with the film. I don't hate i as much as other fans though. The CGI is pretty dated by today's standards and the action sequences can be overblown. They are still fun though and Hugh Jackman steals every scene he is in. He is what made the movie more tolerable for me as he is the definitive live-action Wolverine. The strongest part of this film was the relationship between Wolverine and Sabertooth. It is one of the biggest rivalries in comic history and this film finally brought it to life. Saber- tooth doesn't look as animallistic as he should have been but he is still a fun villain and a worth opponent for Wolverine to face. The same cannot really be said about the other villians. The Blob is your typical obstacle that is only there to give Wolverine information that the audience already knows and agent Z gets taken down too easily. Deadpool gets the worst treatment though as his mouth is shown shut and his humor is absent from this film. This was such a hated part of the film that even Deadpool himself mad fun of it in his own movie. The romance is really only there to be the main means of revenge for Wolverine's motivation and it is not as developed as it could have been. The connections with the other films are forced at best. This is not the best movie in the franchise and it could be seen as the worst one but I don't think it is as bad as everyone else claims it is.",
