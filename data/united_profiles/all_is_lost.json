It's all very convincing, but if you look at 127 Hours, or Life of Pi, you'll see how much more engaging this type of movie can be.  Redford did a decent job acting but it wasn't a very challenging role to play.  He just had to hold a serious face the whole time.

If you\u2019re a Robert Redford fan (The Sting, Spy Games) you\u2019ll find it okay, if you\u2019re an artsy Robert Redford fan you\u2019ll like it, if you like sailing it\u2019s definitely entertaining, but if you\u2019re looking for a movie night with some friends you might want to pass on it.

I would say that if you know not to expect an action packed experience going into this then you would be fine, but even as someone who knew not to expect that I found myself caught off guard by how boring this film ended up being. For the majority of the film, rather than watching Robert Redford fight for survival, we watch him go through menial tasks. There are some interesting scenes here and there, but overall the film seems to just drag on. I wouldn't call what Redford does here acting, as his character very rarely shows any emotion or speaks at all. It's not bad, but instead a rather dull and boring film. I don't recommend it unless you are just a survival fanatic.",

First, although Our Man seems to be a fairly seasoned sailor, and has most of the right equipment on the boat, he failed to immediately turn on the bilge pump when he first saw water pouring in through the damaged hull. That would be one of the first things an experienced sailor would think of in that situation. If he had started to pump immediately, he might have saved his electrical system, including the batteries, depending of course on how good or large-capacity the electric bilge pump was. Second, an immediate emergency repair of the hull would have been in order. There is a technique of wrapping a sail around the hull as a temporary measure to keep the water from pouring in, and many cruising sailboats carry pieces of waterproof fabric (such as sailcloth), and ways to attach them to the hull, to make immediate emergency repairs.",

He struggled to put on a storm jib which should have been easily accessible too since he saw the storm coming. I did like the way the boat was patched and he did try to get noticed by the containers, but as most sailors know, there is no one on the bridge of the containers and no one wandering around their decks at night.  His flares left a lot to be desired but I cannot blame him for trying to light a fire on the life raft except it caught the whole thing alight.  That was too bad.  I do know that there wasn't any hand at the end and that he died or drowned.  The photography was great and I was sad to see the boat sink.

With little to no dialogue, \u2018All is Lost\u2019 is filled with subtext and relies on Robert Redford tremendous talents to hold the screen alone. Redford\u2019s unnamed character (titled \u2018Our Man\u2019 in the credits), is an ambiguous figure with literally no back-story; but that made him all the more intriguing. There was no scenery chewing in the performance, just plain stoicism as his character steers peril in the eye\u2026 all truly felt lost. Chandor is no stranger to the dynamics of the 2008 financial crisis, and it\u2019s very possible that some of these issues are layered between the fine lines of this story. With an abandoned shipping container being the initial cause of Our Man\u2019s high seas accident, one could relate that to the irresponsibility of big corporations and the negative effects it has on the people. However, as you would expect from this metaphorical movie; it\u2019s all up to each viewer\u2019s interpretation. I applaud the rigorous efforts placed in producing this film, but for some reason I thought it was a tough film to fully connect to. It may be due to its stark minimalism or maybe the subtle emotional payoff.

      "text": "I have owned All Is Lost for some time now i just never got around to watching it that's a shame because i knew the film was good but damn i didn't know it was going to be a contender for my favorite Robert Redford movie. The fact that Robert Redford says less then 10 words through out the whole film is amazing i think its not till like the 22 minute mark till we hear him finally say something. The plot is simple but masterful some would find this type of film boring but not me i have actually stayed out on a boat for two weeks when i was younger and i had a blast. The film opens up with Robert Redford waking up to little spurts of water coming into his boat he gets up to see that he had clipped the edge of a container full of shoes that had fallen off a cargo ship. Well he ends up fixing the hole in his ship and life goes on as before but soon a huge storm hits and while fixing things around inside his boat a big wave hits his boat causing him to hit his head on a steel post that knocks him out. He then wakes up to water up to his thighs so he gets out a life raft and starts to gather some food and other things and he gets inside is life raft that is being pulled behind the boat. From here we watch Robert Redford try to survive in the open water as he tries to make his way to the Sumatra Straits in hope that he ends up being saved.",
