The Internship follows a pair of smooth-talking salesmen/best buds who find themselves turfed when their workplace goes under. In a mid-life attempt to strike out beyond \"safe\" decisions, the outdated duo  They rock out to 90s-era Alanis Morissette! They cite Flashdance for motivation!  vie for Google's internship program and pit themselves against the younger generation's best and brightest in hopes of landing a job at the wildly successful company. What comes next ticks every box of the typical underdog tale. Billy (Vaughn) and Nick (Owen Wilson) are targeted by an ambitious, jerky, British (of course!) antagonist (Max Minghella)  check. They're thrown together with a band of nerdy misfit/outcast archetypes  check (in this case, a handful of cynical Millenials long on book-learning but short on life experience). The pair face disapproval from a stern manager (Aasif Mandvi, who perfected his straight-faced delivery on The Daily Show)  check. The team bonds and ultimately overcomes adversity, discovering that these two \"old\" dogs can still offer up a new trick or two. Oh, and we can't forget the aloof staffer (Rose Byrne) piqued by Wilson's puppy-dog charm  check and check. Moviegoers aren't getting anything new from either Vaughn or Wilson, who basically fall back into their same Wedding Crashers personas. Still, like their salesman characters, the actors (Vaughn especially) appear to be busting their humps and deserve credit for achieving an earnest likeability. Billy's pep talks, for instance, are classic gabby Vaughn and showcase his strength as a persuasive motor-mouth. Will Ferrell and Rob Riggle deliver all-too brief cameos as bizarro characters that  thankfully  offer real laughs. The Internship screens like a love-letter to Google, its \"don't be evil\" motto and oft-professed desire to better the world. Shot in part at the company's corporate HQ in Mountain View, Calif., the movie's gee-whiz scenes of the famed indoor slides, nap pods and driverless cars feel a bit dated for anyone who knows even a smidgen about the company. Though it doesn't delve deep, The Internship brushes upon the real-life issue of a generation of workers increasingly becoming obsolete at the same time younger successors believe that the \"American Dream thing that you guys grew on up  that's all it is nowadays: a dream.\" In the end, The Internship is a completely conventional, feather-light, feel-good comedy: familiar, palatable and, most likely, forgettable mere moments after you leave the cinema.",

Vaughn is hilarious and plays his iconic big man quick wit routine alongside Wilson's boyish charm. The underlying messages surrounding today's job and economic climate is sound. Obscure 80s references alongside tech jargon and Star Wars metaphors and similes fill the majority of dialogue. Ironically, Rose  Byrne the lead actress was actually in Episode II  Attack of the Clones  This time round she dusts off her original Aussie accent and puts it to somewhat awkward use as Wilson's object of affection.

I personally am a big fan of the people involved here and would have welcomed a Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson reunion much sooner after their 2005 runaway hit Wedding Crashers, but instead of going for the easy way out and continuing to team up with one another these guys ultimately decided to stray from their core comedy group altogether. Sure, Vaughn made a few with his little crew of friends that include Jason Bateman, Peter Billingsly, and Jon Favreau, but he also made one too many Christmas-themed movies and didn't fully take advantage of the opportunity that Wedding Crashers ultimately afforded him. Wilson has had similar troubles as of late not starring as a leading man in a genuine hit since 2008's Marley & Me. He has gained more credibility after the success of Woody Allen's Midnight in Paris, but his mainstream efforts like Hall Pass and The Big Year didn't do much to keep his name strong in the genre he became most notable for. Granted we are no longer in the first five years of the new millennium and efforts like Old School, Zoolander, Starsky & Hutch, and Dodgeball are now relegated to a time long past, but nonetheless I've always enjoyed watching these guys individually and the one time they teamed up prior will forever be a point of nostalgia, so I was more than open and willing to give The Internship a fair shot. Maybe it was because the trailers weren't too impressive, maybe because I expected it to receive a lukewarm reception, or maybe because I finally admitted to myself these guys are getting older and a time will come when they no longer make broad comedies and that this may in fact be the nail in the coffin, but whatever it was I came out more pleased with the film than I ever expected. Maybe these guys have a little more to give after all.",

Throughout the entire film they try and make us feel like Google is the best thing to happen to this generation since the PS4 or the new iPhones. It starts to feel less like a plot detail and more like an embarrassing joke. As if to say \"Hey, come work for Google! Its just as fun as going to a themepark with computers.\" The main characters seem to act like they were totally oblivious to the massive technology evolution in the past decade. It's supposed to follow these two as they try amd compete for a job after their old job got out done by machines doing most of the jobs for them. After they find out working for Google could be their only shot they try and compete for a job, despite having no teaching of anything to do with computers in their entire careers. The Internship is a disposable waste of time and you should probably avoid it.",

However it seems like the duo have lost their edge over they years and really the premise of the movie is just not a funny one. I do hope the pair work together again. I also liked the idea to have a lot of kids for supporting characters because that made it more applicable for teens. However it just doesn't work.",
