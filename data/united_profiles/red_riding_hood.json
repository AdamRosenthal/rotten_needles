That said, RRH is that 1 out of 10:  the Stinker...just a weird and stilted film that never finds its footing.  One of the funkier things about the movie is that it has the trappings of a period piece where you expect the characters to have at least a little bit of British accent, but they all end up talking like your standard modern American (with the exception of Gary Oldman who overacts--or maybe it just seems likes he overacts b/c the other actors barely are acting).  Visual, Design and Costumes were cool... especially RRH's deep red Hood/Cape contrasting with the cool colors.  Bottom Line:  Amanda Seyfried's beauty saves the movie from being a zero.",

      "text": "From the maker of \"Thirteen\", the 2003 film that depicts the accelerated speed in which kids are growing up in today's society, now comes \"Red Riding Hood\", the latest retelling of the ancient faerie tale made famous by The Brothers Grimm(known as \"Rottkappchen\") that shows how young medieval wenches from yore were no chaste angels either. Billed as a reworking of the popular \"Twilight Saga\", the film's theme of a young girl's lost innocence aligns itself equally well with the Larry Clark-lite indie, since in the recent \"Eclipse\", Bella(Kristen Stewart) keeps her virginity, whereas Valerie(Amanda Seyfried) gives it away quite freely for a nineteenth century chick. Starring Evan Rachel Wood and Holly Hunter, \"Thirteen\" examines the ramifications of a mother who tries too hard to be her daughter's contemporary. In one scene, set at a high-end Melrose clothing boutique, Tracey emerges from the changing room outfitted in garb more suitable for a bar than middle school. Most mothers would throw a fit, but Melanie, a former flower child, wanting to be \"the hot big sister\" that Evie(Nikki Reed) labels her as, endorses the tight-fitting ensemble by remarking, \"You look incredible.\" In effect, encouraging her little girl to flaunt her wares around boys through coquettish behavior. Similarly, in \"Red Riding Hood\", Valerie, who had previously looked as if she were a Renaissance fair fashion victim, accepts the scintillating red cloak from her proto-hippie grandmother(Julie Christie), who all but encourages the young lass to dress provocatively and to engage in sexual activities by warning the newly-ordained Red Riding Hood to be \"careful\". She makes for an equally poor role model as Valerie's mother, who gave birth to a love child, her half-sister Lucy. Betrothed to a wealthy blacksmith, Valerie still possesses some unresolved feelings towards a lowly woodcutter, who should have been the original wolf instead of a red herring, since the final plot twist creates some unintended sexual tension among family members.  The red cloak, originally intended as a wedding present to be worn on the night she was supposed to consummate her nuptials with Henry(Max Irons), the sexually-charged garment instead is utilized as a means to seduce Peter(Shiloh Fernandez) in a premarital fling, thereby spoiling the girl's chances for gainful holy matrimony. Valerie ends up living in the forest as an outcast, cohabitating with an animal outside the sanctity of marriage.",

Only positive thing i found was the Village set ! but other then that nothing works...Nothing ! They ruined the classic story , To the Director \"Never do one thing over and over again\"  , Acting was so bad ! Amanda tried but failed and the director wanted to make 2 more \"Edward\" in this movie and guess what like Robert they should also take acting lessons . i had only hope in Gary Old-man but i think it was his worst acting job ever .",

The acting is lackluster at best with Amanda Seyfried leading the pack of bad performances. The makeup design was horrible with the female and male actors all dolled up as if they had the luxury of twenty-first century cosmetics.  The score is nothing to brag about and the dim lighting used in all scenarios prohibited this film from becoming at all emotionally impactful. The only saving grace is the twist ending, which then soils itself with the defecation of the final ending.",

All this words be the better to describe Red Riding Hood. The cast is very regular, Amanda Seyfried not is a great actress, but have her moments, but in Riding Hood, no, is horrible, with a same face of Stewart on Twilight, and the rest of the cast, really? have a horrible performances, and do a boring movie. Now the screenplay, have good intentions, but really? the father is the wolf? what happen?, is a terrible idea. Now do this classic tale like a horror film, or poor intent or horror movie is bad. I think that the movie have some good (but no excellent effects), the screenplay terrible, horrible performances, and the final do of Red Riding Hood one of the worst films of the last year.",

Amanda Seyfried is gorgeous as always and plays the role of young Valerie very well, but in general the cast is just average.
