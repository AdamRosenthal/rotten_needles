      "text": "From the maker of \"Thirteen\", the 2003 film that depicts the accelerated speed in which kids are growing up in today's society, now comes \"Red Riding Hood\", the latest retelling of the ancient faerie tale made famous by The Brothers Grimm(known as \"Rottkappchen\") that shows how young medieval wenches from yore were no chaste angels either. Billed as a reworking of the popular \"Twilight Saga\", the film's theme of a young girl's lost innocence aligns itself equally well with the Larry Clark-lite indie, since in the recent \"Eclipse\", Bella(Kristen Stewart) keeps her virginity, whereas Valerie(Amanda Seyfried) gives it away quite freely for a nineteenth century chick. Starring Evan Rachel Wood and Holly Hunter, \"Thirteen\" examines the ramifications of a mother who tries too hard to be her daughter's contemporary. In one scene, set at a high-end Melrose clothing boutique, Tracey emerges from the changing room outfitted in garb more suitable for a bar than middle school. Most mothers would throw a fit, but Melanie, a former flower child, wanting to be \"the hot big sister\" that Evie(Nikki Reed) labels her as, endorses the tight-fitting ensemble by remarking, \"You look incredible.\" In effect, encouraging her little girl to flaunt her wares around boys through coquettish behavior. Similarly, in \"Red Riding Hood\", Valerie, who had previously looked as if she were a Renaissance fair fashion victim, accepts the scintillating red cloak from her proto-hippie grandmother(Julie Christie), who all but encourages the young lass to dress provocatively and to engage in sexual activities by warning the newly-ordained Red Riding Hood to be \"careful\". She makes for an equally poor role model as Valerie's mother, who gave birth to a love child, her half-sister Lucy. Betrothed to a wealthy blacksmith, Valerie still possesses some unresolved feelings towards a lowly woodcutter, who should have been the original wolf instead of a red herring, since the final plot twist creates some unintended sexual tension among family members.  The red cloak, originally intended as a wedding present to be worn on the night she was supposed to consummate her nuptials with Henry(Max Irons), the sexually-charged garment instead is utilized as a means to seduce Peter(Shiloh Fernandez) in a premarital fling, thereby spoiling the girl's chances for gainful holy matrimony. Valerie ends up living in the forest as an outcast, cohabitating with an animal outside the sanctity of marriage.",

This movie is more like a twilight than a horror movie.  I like that they made red riding hood older. You would think since Red Riding Hood is older that this movie will be for older people. You wrong. Still the same type of movie as twilight. More romance than horror. I thought this movie was going be a horror film. THis movie has the same type of music that a twilight movie would have. Im kind of a twilight fan. I like twilight way more than this movie. I think that they might try to make another movie of this. If you like  Gothic movies than you will love this. A very bored and very entertaining Gothic Horror movie. More drama and romance than horror. This movie does has dip of horror. Just a little dip. The scary parts in the movie might be scary to only kids under 10. If you over ten it might not be scary to you. A great movie to see if you love Twilight. I think twilight fan is loving this movie. The screenwriting was dry but it was an average movie. Beginning is boring but it pick up after the beginning.",

This movie was a disaster and even though Amanda Seyfriend is in it, is not a good enough reason to rate it high. That is not a true review. She is a very limited range actress, and while has done a couple of good things, she really can't due dramatic roles with the depth they require. A really good actress can sometimes do something good with the character despite crappy writing and wierd animals flying around. I suppose it is young people who keep saying they like this crap and therefore will never get anything better..what a shame. Filmaking in the last decade has hit it's lowest point. The continual dumbing down of american youth. *sigh*.I'll stick to the older character and dialogue driven oldies. I don't need a lot of bells and whistles to keep my attention.

Great acting, small flaws in the movie, but in my opinion, a film worth seeing.
