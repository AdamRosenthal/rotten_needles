It had some really nice acting from Timothy Hutton and the Culkins, but so much of it was trite indie quirk. I'm sure the ending was supposed to make you \"think,\" but it was just uninspired. Martini may have potential, but this film definitely won't make him known for taking any chances.",

The direction is classy, and it allows the performers to really shine.  I highly suggest than any true film lover see this film.  It's unlike any other I have seen over the last few years.",
