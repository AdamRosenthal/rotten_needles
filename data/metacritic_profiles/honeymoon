The directorial debut of Leigh Janiak, Honeymoon is a tense, chilling little indie horror flick with adequate performances from Rose Leslie and Harry Treadaway. The film is deeply influenced by both science fiction and more demonic possession type horror films (think Invasion of the Body Snatchers, Rosemary's Baby, The Exorcist, etc.) and is not completely original, but does play around with both of these two leave you really questioning what actually happened at the end. This ambiguous ending will not work for everyone, but it really worked for me and really heightened my enjoyment of it because of the various clues left for any explanation. Overall, Janiak demonstrates a very good understanding of genre conventions and how to make a satisfyingly slow building horror film with great atmosphere and thoroughly entertaining chills.",

It ended up being a really creepy and weird movie. Honeymoon is about two newlyweds on their honeymoon, Paul and Bea, but it takes a turn for the worst when Paul finds Bea dazed and confused in the middle of the woods one night. The film's structure reminds me of Paranormal Activity or The House of the Devil; not much really happens until the final act, but when it does happen, it's crazy scary. The tension builds up very nicely for the first hour and leads to an excellent payoff. What's nice about Honeymoon is that it allows us some time to get to know the two characters before we get into the meat of the story, which always helps a horror film. It might be a little slow for some people more attuned to a constant barrage of scary faces and gore, but if you like your movies heavy on atmosphere and tension, Honeymoon is the perfect movie.",
