      "text": "I recently rented this movie and saw it for the first time.  Orphan is a new take on an old horror genre - the evil child movie.  But the twist at the end is probably what makes the movie even more disturbing when you watch the movie again.  The bits of dialogue in the film, while not particularly memorable, seem to have a more sinister take in the second viewing.  The acting in the film was especially good.  Isabelle Fuhrman's acting was particularly notable without saying, but it would be folly to overlook the convincing performances of the rest of the cast.  The story itself was good at it's core, but it fell flat at major points, such as pacing and introducing character development at wrong moments.  The latter part of that sentence is especially important, as it seemed that the filmmakers wanted to introduce new flaws in the protagonist to excuse the actions of the antagonist late in the film.  On another note, the movie worked too hard to have a disruptive character (the Orphan) integrate into a disrupted family, almost as if she had some sort of hand in the problems that plagued the family before showing up to wreak havoc.  In a horror movie, one-dimensional characters aren't a problem, but when there's too much depth to potential victims you have trouble following.  Lastly, as mentioned before, the pacing of the film poor and slow.  For some reason, \"Suspense\" was defined as utilizing camera shots and cheap jump shots to establish an atmosphere of \"on edge\" horror.  While it might work for some films, I can't understand why it was used throughout this entire movie, particularly when the antagonist hasn't even shown up.  It began to get old and predictable to a point that when the real horror began, you could tell that the filmmakers weren't even that interested in it anymore.  The film gets this rating for trying to be original and bringing in a strong troupe of performers who did well with what they had to work with.  But the story could have been a little less complex, maybe camped up.",

      "text": "A family of four is torn apart after adopting a seemingly sweet and intelligent Russian girl. Her mysterious past catches up with them as a series of accidents befall the family members and anyone else that crosses Esther's path. ORPHAN was a big hit upon its release in 2009, despite its many setbacks that keep it from becoming a classic in the killer kids genre. The character of Esther is written and played far too menacingly for her to remain unnoticed. There is no ambiguity in her actions, as she is clearly portrayed as being evil from the very start. As a result, much of the film relies on the shock of her actions rather than the build up or suspense leading up to them. It does, however, manage to maintain the mystery behind her shady background long enough to give the audience one final surprise! Esther's adopted parents are easily the most frustrating parents in recent Horror. Her crackpot mother is irritating and irresponsible, while her idiot father stands completely oblivious to her evil ways in light of the horrible tragedies that are affecting his family. They gain no sympathy or support as a result. If films were graded solely on their twist endings, ORPHAN would rate at the top of its class, but the carelessness of the writing cannot be overcome by the clean cinematography or Isabelle Fuhrman's creepy performance as Esther. -Carl Manes",

If the performance wasn't in the context of a messed up girl in a horror movie, she would have gotten academy notice, she was THAT good. Jimmy Bennett was also really good playing her adoptive brother, he even did his own stunts. Every time I see this kid he gets better and better, and I think you'll be seeing his name in films for the next fifty years.

      "text": "I would've never thought that this movie would degenerate so much. Most of its second half is just immensely stupid and unbearably preposterous. While the beginning is suspenseful and seems to build up a good horror movie with a snowballing amount of frightening scenes, it just totally falls apart at the end. I could have lived with some of the absurd stuff happening in Orphan before, but at some point it was just enough. It decayed in illogical, dumbly disturbing action that wasn't enjoyable in any possible way. This is pretty disappointing regarding the way the movie started and continued during the first hour: it kept you interested about Esther, the screenplay introduced us better to the other parts of the family as well, the scenes that were supposed to scare you scared me. Everything like it should be in a good psychological horror. But when the grotesque truth about Esther is finally revealed, I was sitting there like \u201cThis is why I usually don't like horror movies.\u201d It was a very unpleasant experience, not only because the extremely disturbing things the orphan girl is doing in this movie, but also because it leaves you sitting there, pondering about why you've ever took this movie seriously. Okay, Isabelle Fuhrmann did a surprising job as Esther although I didn't enjoy her that much since the screenplay wasn't really good and Vera Fermiga was a good lead, mostly. However, this ending just makes you angry because it totally destroys a movie that could've been good, but ends up being an imbecile disaster. Seriously, this ending was one of the worst I've seen in movie history.",

In saying that, there WERE three distinct flaws that came to mind: One, I'm not sure a marriage THAT troubled would be allowed to adopt a child; two, I don't see how ANYONE as intelligent as that pair are proposed to be would ever adopt anyone without having the necessary background information; and three, being a parent myself, there's no way on God's green earth that I would have continued the social experiment of the orphan's adoption the very first moment that something bizarre happened, or that things went awry.",

      "text": "This film is an intense psychological thriller, which although is no Shawshank Redemption, it is fun to watch. Orphan has an interesting concept which ultimately is built up too much leading to a less surprising twist, but surprisingly this does not affect the film too badly. Also, Vera Farmiga's performance is truly compelling in this film, and the child actors are unusually less annoying than one would expect. The little girl who plays Farmiga's on-screen deaf daughter Maxine is heartwarming to watch, and brings a great aspect to Orphan itself. However, Peter Sarsgard's performance is lacking in this film, which is partially due to his lack of character development in the script, which depicts his character as a little too unintelligent for the rich architect he portrays.",
