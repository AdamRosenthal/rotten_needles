      "text": "The non-fiction novel Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience, and Redemption is an incredibly riveting, moving biography of Olympian and prisoner-of-war Louis Zamperini that I believe is an important book to read. Naturally, a movie based on the book was inevitable; the film adaptation does do its subject justice, even if it's only sporadically compelling. Unbroken is a bio-pic about the life of Louie Zamperini in World War II, whose bomber plane was shot down, and he was forced to survive on a raft for 47 days. He was then captured by the Japanese and placed in various camps for over two years, where he was severely abused until he was rescued at the end of the war. There are a lot of great things about Unbroken: the spectacular cinematography, breakout performances from the entire cast, an explosive opening act and some genuinely moving scenes throughout the rest of the film. Angelina Jolie directs the film in a surprisingly graceful way. Despite some obviously unpleasant war scenes present in the film, Unbroken is a beautiful movie to look at. An opportunity that the film misses, however, is the effects of the war on Louie. His battle with alcoholism and PTSD is never mentioned in the film, and although it would have made the movie longer than it already is (137 minutes), there should have been an emphasis on those ideas. Even if it doesn't resonate as strongly as it should, Unbroken is compelling enough to do justice to its subject matter and a must-watch if yo're a fan of World War II movies.",

While the film has some great moments that were well done, nicely adapted, and gripping especially in the first third, there are other moments that either glossed over or omitted entirely preventing the film from having the kick it needs. Its frustrating when some parts of the film are executed really well and other times the film is screaming \u201cNotice Me, Nominate Me, Oscars where we come.\u201d Had the filmmakers been more focused on making a good movie for the sake of making a good movie and not going for the gold and/or if the film had been a miniseries it could\u2019ve been great and fleshed out the characters and effectively told the story. As it is, its alright. I didn\u2019t feel like I had completely wasted my time although I do wish I had been able to see American Sniper. In a month where Hollywood tends to give me garbage I\u2019m glad that there was something out there I could see and get something out of. People who haven\u2019t read the book will be able to follow the film ok and might enjoy it more without familiarity with the story. This is a depressing, interesting, and important aspect of World War II and its nice that so many people are being exposed to. If you have read the book though and are a fan of the story, you\u2019ll be disappointed at the alternations and omissions made that prevent the film from being as great as it could\u2019ve been. In all seriousness though if you are curious read the book its really good. As for the movie its ok. It was engaging and wasn\u2019t a waste of my time but I\u2019m probably not going out of my way to see it again and I\u2019m not going to highly recommend it either. Check it out if you are interested but if you\u2019ve read the book, lower your expectations.",
