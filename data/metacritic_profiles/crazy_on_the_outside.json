      "text": "Tim Allen creates a film thats all about him.  One would think with all that \"star firepower\" that this film might cook.  It fails as a comedy, as a drama and as a film.  Karle Warren (Loren -Judging Amy) has 2 lines.  Ray Liotta plays a heavy but his role is not defined.   Sigourney Weaver plays Allens sister yet her role is more of a cameo.  In fact the heavy hitters in the film are mostly cameo roles.   A waste of time but a payday for the actors.",
