The song \"Big Eyes\" was used perfectly in the film and truly communicated the feelings Margaret Keane was feeling at the moment.

On that note, the plot was very interesting. Very interesting story and enjoyable to watch unfold. Art is not something that really interests me, but when put on screen in this fashion, it was riveting. I also loved the cinematography.

Christoph Waltz isn't quite believable as the charming sociopath, because his charm is too manic from the beginning--I wanted him to be a more talented liar early on, so that his unravelling could be more satisfying.  Similarly Amy Adams' misery and submission aren't entirely convincing either, and the hallucinations so prominently advertised in the trailer had a minimal role in the movie, and lacked an accompanying narrative of mental illness to explain or justify them.  The movie was still somewhat enjoyable overall, but it felt too glossy and superficial to be a compelling portrait of the Keanes.",

Adams turns this halting, insecure character into a nuanced and compelling performance.

This most intriguing story of the Keane's and their big eye paintings invites exploration into gender politics, sexism, pop culture v. high art, and the very nature of art itself. I wish the film failed for seeking to explore too many areas, instead Burton and his screenwriters are only interested in rubbing the surface of the Keane's personal story and the filmmakers depict this world with little threat or real consequence. That's why it comes as such as a shock in the final moments when Margaret Keane testifies to being manipulated and threatened. When was there any real threat? Why is her duplicity never explored with any depth? Amy Adams has the chops to deliver what is needed but instead, Burton focuses relentlessly on the shenanigans of Walter Keane. In many ways, Burton and his two male screenwriters are guilty of doing to Margaret's story exactly what Walter did to Margaret in real life. The film is entertaining, but ultimately, nothing more than a diversion when depth and insight were there for the exploring.",

Russell (American Hustle) directed it, it would have been even better. Christopher Waltz delivers in his performance, and Amy Adams is good, but her fake accent got a bit annoying. The pacing was uneven, as the beginning and end felt rushed, but the middle seemed dragged out. Overall, this was an enjoyable film, but it did not perform to its full potential.",
