      "text": "A beautiful feel good flick. I watched this on a Sunday night before facing a mucky, mundane Monday in the office, It did the trick and had me hooked, A pretty fairy tale like portrayal of London. Light hearted humor. The kids aren't annoying which is always a bonus. Very colorful and charismatic, I even managed a few guffaws whilst clutching my can of Zubr.  Quite a few  cheeky British cameo roles which  give it that  lovely, warm sort of Love Actually vibe, If its raining outside, you're under the weather or just hungover, grab a pot noodle, a cup of tea &  bang this on,  Guaranteed sweet dreams.",

      "text": "Paddington is a film based on books and a TV show, which I have never read or seen. Firstly, the characters in this movie are really enjoyable, especially Paddington himself, who we honestly can feel sorry for. The humour is spot on as well and have to mention one line \"Now say, Stratford upon aven\".  I also liked how English it was, with many films set in America, it was nice too see a change. I would also say that both adults and children would enjoy this film. However, the plot in this movie is very predictable, and the villain is quite clich\u00e9 too. After going over all these points I would say that Paddington is a good film that is very fun and a film that adults will enjoy as much as children.",
