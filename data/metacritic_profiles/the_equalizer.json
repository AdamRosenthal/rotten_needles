      "text": "The Equalizer was one of the most underrated shows of the 1980s, it was a great show, but it always lacked a certain intensity that the lead character needed. In this 2014 film adaptation of the series, Director, Antoine Fuqua, made sure that didn't happen again. Denzel Washington stars and can play anyone, but I find he's at his best when he's playing a dark loner like Robert McCall. McCall, a former CIA operative has retired and is attempting to live a normal life. Everything is going as planned, until he sees a young girl being abused, and decides to take action. McCall believe he's just going up against a local pimp, but discovers it's a lot more complicated than that. Washington continues to be at the top of his game, as the ageless wonder is once again spectacular. This film is everything I loved about the series, with a whole lot more action and intensity. Director, Antoine Fuqua, has been on a role after films like Training Day, Shooter, and Olympus Has Fallen, and he has become THE guy when it comes to action films. Playing off an established franchise and paired with Denzel Washington, The Equalizer has come back to life and is one of the most refreshing action films I've seen in a long time. Sometimes with a different team, what was once old, can become new again, and I was practically jumping out of my seat with excitement. As far as the continuation of the series goes, Fuqua is in the early stages of a sequel. It may not be a new TV series, but it's still something exciting for the fans, and I for one can't wait to see more.",

Denzel Washington and Chloe Grace Moretz star in what is a sadly realistic portrayal of the American underworld, particularly focusing on the issue of sex trafficking. The film is at times painful and disturbing to watch, however, it is necessary in presenting an accurate representation of such aspects. Denzel plays his role extremely powerfully, adding to the tense drama with moments of subtle comedic humour and outrageously unnecessary acts of violence. With the addition of well developed antagonists, the film questions our sense of morals expertly.",

      "text": "What differentiates a trashy, loudly violent action film from an entertaining, genuine guilty pleasure? If there\u2019s a line, The Equalizer walks on it like an acrobat on a tightrope. Antoine Fuqua\u2019s most recent work establishes itself as a crowd-pleaser, leaving spectators in awe, but every fluctuation between nonsense and coherency creates uneasiness and raises eyebrows. One might think: I hope this guy knows what he\u2019s doing. Fuqua\u2019s previous feature, Olympus Has Fallen (2013), felt like that too: an action packed thriller, forgoing all plot consistency, continuity and common sense for the sake of staging uncontrollable mayhem inside the White House. Since his deservedly acclaimed Training Day (2001), the American director has seemingly found it difficult to keep up with expectations. He has, nonetheless, always had good eye for action scenes, managing to build remarkable and gripping sequences. Much like some of his past works (King Arthur and Brooklyn\u2019s Finest to name but a few), The Equalizer suffers the pains of lacklustre direction. The tasteless use of alarm clock shots to set temporal continuity, or the abundance of dull and redundant digressions, are only a couple of examples. Nevertheless, the film also offers great action, riveting exchanges, and a likeable, cathartic anti-hero.",

It seems to me, we viewers who choose this fare put rationality on hold in order to enjoy the plot and especially the climax. Personally, I was glad the villain was international and not just the local pimp. I did think Densel\u2019s character spent a bit too much time just thinking (implying, \u2026feeling sorry for himself); however, the \u201cdown time\u201d has to be used for something and sensitive assassins pay a price becoming friendly.",

I say this not only because of how the movie was directed, the plot, etc, but I say this also because near the end of the film, the main character (Denzel) was shown with this book.

This isn't the first time director Antoine Fuqua and actor Denzel Washington have worked together. Training Day was a film that produced a Best Actor for Denzel, so I was particularly excited for the two reuniting in an action film. However, this ain't your average action film. Fuqua really knows how to direct compelling action with an artistic framework. He's not like other directors who feel the need to unnecessarily shake the camera to hide the atrocious fight choreography and create cheap adrenaline, he actually uses the action to tell the character's story. You learn more about Washington's character through his fighting than you do through his dialogue. The film also had a strong antagonist, played by Marton Csokas, who had as much screen presence as the protagonist himself, which most action films lack, however, like I said before, this ain't your average action film. All that and a riveting action sequence that takes place in a hardware store should be enough to get your blood pumping for days on end.",

The villain is expertly played similar to what James Bond 007 usually faced in his adventures. And Denzel improvises for his choice of weapons usually on the fly. He is always one step ahead of the bad guys. He's the type of vigilante we all wish we had in this world. Maybe he can pay a visit to ISIS?  He can do what our President doesn't have the backbone to do!  Basically as our fearful Commander In Chief hasn't learned as yet, you can't negotiate with bad guys that have no respect for human life, theirs or our own. Denzel as The Equalizer makes us stand up and cheer. Can't wait for the sequel. Great action popcorn movie. Go see and enjoy!",

This is also because(SPOILER ALERT) I feel like this was all about that 1 girl that Bob was trying to save and that it wasn't about The Equalizer or him trying to equally save everyone like the movie title suggests or hints to. They tried to show that he was Indeed  an \"equalizer\" but it wasn't enough for me the theme of the movie should have been explored more. However if they make a 2nd Movie where the theme of Equalizer is demonstrated and explored in a better fashion the score goes up to a 10 or 9.75 to be critical.

On the action side we have long periods between each action scene making it a put off for those who were hoping for a straight action flick. Those were the bad things about this movie. The Good: The first thing to mention is Denzel Washington's ability to make nearly all of his characters relate-able and likable, even when playing a murderous killer who violently dispatches his enemies. Which brings me to my next good point, although the action is few and far between, the parts we did get to see were brilliant. Avoiding a straight shootout whenever possible and going or more creative fight scenes made this movie a more watchable experience for all audiences, making you crave the action that little bit more. Another point i would like to mention is that the villain played by Marton Csokas was very creepy and intense, making him an enjoyable villain to watch, although a bit more character development for him would have been nice, they do start some, but it never really goes anywhere. All in all i give this movie a 7 as it was enjoyable to watch, with great action scenes and acting, but the story itself was not all that linear or clear, it just seemed to be about a guy who helps people because he can, but never explains why he does or should, and a villain who kills for the same reason.",

As one of the most consistently bankable actor in Hollywood (at least in the domestic market), Washington\u2019s good-man card never fail his audience, bar his sortie in portraying an ambiguous character as a drunken pilot garners him another Oscar-nomination in Robert Zemeckis\u2019 FLIGHT (2012, 7/10).

It almost felt like he had never directed a film in his entire life, found a list of all the cool camera tricks, angles, and cinematic effects, and felt compelled to include each and every one of them. How did this impact the movie? It made it seem as though it lacked any identity whatsoever. Secondly, there is a critical moment in the final major conflict resolution that is just terrible. To avoid spoilers, let's just say that the protagonist that had been established throughout the film makes a decision that he would never make. That, combined with the plot getting a little out of hand, made the last quarter or so of the movie hard to swallow. It wasn't all bad, however, as the rating should reflect. The acting was great and fighting sequences were done incredibly well. The build up and initial character and plot development were fantastic too.
