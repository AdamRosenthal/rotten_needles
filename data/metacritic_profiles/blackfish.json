You don't need to be a die hard animal rights activist to sympathize with the cases presented in the film.

With our apparent intelligence what other reason would there be to imprison such beautiful, intelligent and wild creatures unwittingly submitting them to both physical and mental abuse. The end result, of course, ends in disaster for the humans. This doc is compelling and at times grippingly told and whilst heartfelt there is a certain naivete to the good intentions of the staff of these amusement parks who are as culpable for the whales suffering and the ensuing tragedies as indeed are the captors and, ultimately, the audiences of these questionable attractions.",

It is shocking the extent to which Sea-world have gone to lie and cover things up, some may say it is unbalanced as no official representative from Sea-world responds to criticism but the filmmakers have approached them again and again with no response. Hopefully this film will deal a blow to their profits which is the only way to truly get back at them.",

The filmmakers pushed to dig out the full story of Tilikum and clearly tried to get all sides of the story on the table, so that effort has to be praised. There is also incredible footage of the orcas in their natural habitat providing stark contrast to enclosure life.   But what is lacking is a clear reckoning of the value Sea World brings to conservation and to animal wellbeing outside the tank.  Agreed we should free the orcas (or put them in open water enclosures), and certainly let's tighten OSHA regulations.  But without a more balanced view of the contributions these parks bring to animal welfare it comes across as a shrill piece of Hollywood activism, leaving the viewer to wonder if everyone had a say. That's unfortunate, because this is a very good film.",
