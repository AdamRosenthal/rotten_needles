      "text": "The Fast & Furious brings the franchise back to where it started with the original cast and conflicts that made the first two have some appeal. The only difference is this time I care. The film writes the characters of Paul Walker and Vin Desil in a way that both are likeable especially Vin Desil and the relationship the two have over the course of the film gives it some emotional investment that the other ones lacked. The film while borrowing elements from previous entries picks the good elements such as fun car chases which are for once fun and memorable. The scenarios and sets along with some nice direction make the action in the film engaging minus the occasional moment when its hard to tell what\u2019s going on and one chase sequence early on which has excessive use of shaky cam. The spectacle has also been toned down and hot babes and flashy cars aren\u2019t solely relied on to hold the film up. The characters outside of the leads aren\u2019t fleshed out and there are some clich\u00e9 and predictable moments such as the bad guy reveal and Paul Walker\u2019s characters conflict with the force. Its not a great film but it is entertaining which is something this franchise has never been making this the best of the four and hopefully the future installments keep up this sense of fun.",

I loved seeing almost the entire original cast return and the amazing cars and impressive special effects that are a staple of the series return once again... granted, with a reduced emphasis on the cars themselves. The only real problem I had was that the continuity was broken a bit. *SPOILERS* Why, for example, is Paul Walker back in LA after the ending of 2 Fast 2 Furious? What happened to Tyrese's character? What happened to the rest of the crew from the original movie? These are not huge complaints but they did take away from the experience a bit. It's also evident that this film is a prequel to Tokyo Drift which was a little weird. Nonetheless, great film that is probably better than any of the prior ones other than the first of course.",
