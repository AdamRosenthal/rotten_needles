That line describes the mishmash that was Hitman: Agent 47. It is gleefully violent, terribly long, horribly acted and has a rotten storyline that we have seen before. So, it's a seen-it all assassin movie right? Wrong. This movie gets the basics wrong. The first instalment was a fresher take on the video game. It was bad, but stupid, Friday night fun. See, both of the films bear no resemblance to the games, expect taking the bald action Hitman from them. Everything else is cheesy, rotten plot. Also, no fu**ing stealth! Timothy Oleympiant made a better Hitman than Rupert Friend. He was cool and all, but he had no charm that the previous had. Just a fact.

The screenwrite from the original failed film was somehow hired again for the reboot and it looks like the result was essentially the same.

Zachary quinto plays a terrible villain. rupart wayatt plays a borderline ok/terrible hitman, the women who plays the girl was basically the movies only saving grace and that is not saying much because she is pretty bad.
