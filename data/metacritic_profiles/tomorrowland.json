The characters I found to be quite interesting. George Clooney is great as a gruff older man. Britt Robertson is also equally great as the female lead. But it's Raffey Cassidy as the little girl that steals the movie. Not only was she so unexpected, but she was a straight up bad-ass and served purposefully well in this movie. The big problem with \"Tomorrowland\" is the last act. The message presented something that I first bought into at first, but it kept beating you over the head. And the big climax was a big let down. And the ending doesn't leave you inspired because of its forced message. Other than that, I think the movie is quite a bit of fun with awesome action/visual sequences and great characters. If you didn't like it the first time, I want to recommend those to at least give it another try. I give this a B!",

The key to this being an above average movie that is discretely preachy is that is is FUN. Non-stop throughout the movie. It is so fun and entertaining that it often masks its preachy nature of a great deal of the film. The most stand out feature of the film is that an unknown actress, Raffey Cassidy, steals the show. The acting from the entire cast is very good throughout the film however she absolutely steals the show anytime she is on screen. Her skill is a prime example of an actor bringing their A-game when it counts and she does it. Even in scenes when she is with academy award winner George Clooney she is head and shoulders the best on screen.",

The brief visits to this incredible place are full of eye-popping visuals and cool creative concepts, but most of the movie takes place in the present day. When director Brad Bird switches on the action, it's lots of fun (even though there's a surprising body count for Disney).

      "text": "Okay, so I went to see this movie with a 14 year old son of a friend.  I was charmed by the retro look of the opening scenes at the 1964 World's Fair (I remember that, and it was pretty close to the remembered reality). One of the best things about the movie is the uncanny resemblance between the actor who plays a young Frank Walker and George Clooney, who plays him as an adult.  As sci-fi movies go, this was pretty tame, although there were a few neat special effects (a particular favorite being the multi-level swimming pools).  The premise behind the movie, that we affect the future by our attitude is something worth thinking about, \"Faux\" news aside. Other than a rather gruesome visit to a hobby shop, there isn't much that is scary in the movie, so it would be okay for younger kids (age 7 and up, I'd say). For adults, well, you have to arrest your analytical mind for a bit to just enjoy the movie at face value (not always easy to do, I admit).  But to share it with a younger person, who finds it charming and exciting and rich with possibilities...?  Well, that made the viewing worthwhile. If you don't have a younger friend to bring with you, you might just want to skip this one. But don't forget the message: we all need to work together to ensure the future of the planet!",

At Disney's level, the idea of the plot is ambitious but sadly it starts to lost its direction at the very beginning and the tone as the story develops seems to be uneven, even the final act of the villain himself is wasted without proper addressing of intention and ended up in a disappointing formulaic way. Performances of Brittany Robertson and Raffey Cassidy are charming and entertaining together with the presence of George Clooney though his appearance seems to be involved in some lame action scenes, the musics from Michael Giacchino are beautiful and full of dreams but all of these are unable to save the flaws of this pointless story telling about the importance of being hopeful, optimistic and inspirational.",

From there, we meet a young woman who finds a pin dropped into her belongings by a mysterious young girl. From there, the story becomes a highly original and great one, while sometimes a bit messy. One key detail to not about this movie is that despite it being named \"Tomorrowland\", the titular place is just the main point everything else happens because of. It's more about getting there than being there, and the final act does suffer a bit because of it. All 3 main actors play their roles amazingly, which is a treat considering 2 of them are children. The special effects are also very well done, and the movie uses them to add some very needed twists on typical sci-fi tropes such as lasers and teleporters.

It would have been nice if the movie was ACTUALLY about that. Instead, the girl, Casey, is only there for about the last 10 minutes of the film. What this movie is really about is saving the world from the apocalypse which is caused by, and I'm not joking, pessimism. Just from that, you can tell this is gonna be one preachy movie. I do wanna say that the acting is top-notch, the special effects are beautiful, and it is an overall entertaining movie. The message of optimism is a great one, but after about 20 minutes, it becomes aggravating how much the movie has to hammer that theme in. That's really Tomorrowland's biggest problem: the movie is more concerned with telling us to \"just be optimistic\" as opposed to telling a cohesive and intelligent story. Many plot points are introduced and completely forgotten by the next scene, and there are many instances where the story will just rush past a potentially important event just so that the characters can tell us even more about optimism and the future of the world.

Visually, Tomorrowland looks wonderful, due to a nearly $200m budget. However, the plot was a meandering mess, the script was laughable, and for the most part the acting was subpar (apart from Clooney and Laurie's barely memorable performances). You don't even understand what's going on until the last act of the movie. The writing was bad, with thick layers of cheesy worn-out tropes. Not to mention that the film claims that Casey is the young female protagonist, then proceeds to sideline her role to focus on George Clooney's character, and on top of that, the one other strong female character in the film is sacrificed to make him feel better about himself. Ugh. For the most part, there were child actors, so I can't really fault them for not being master thespians. However, I expected more out of Britt Robertson. Clooney acted like he does in every other film, and Hugh Laurie still felt like House. Raffey Cassidy did a very good job for a young actress, even though her character went to waste at the end.  I did like the part when Hugh Laurie's character's leg was crushed; I'm assuming that was a tip of the hat to his role as Gregory House. And occasionally, the humor made me chuckle a bit. But overall, this movie was a waste of time and money, both for me and for the makers of the film.",

However, the lacking of the film feels light and after I read the reviews for Tomorrowland, maybe people should've stayed watching Maleficent and/or Cinderella instead and hopefully I could wait for Tomorrowland on DVD. But just like Jupiter Ascending, the hype is the only problem Disney might've gotten misunderstood. I don't know if it's like a children's movie or a sci-fi adventure movie, eventually, there were some minor flaws like the dystopian setting where one girl switches the ring from one town to another as seen in the trailer. The story is just recycled (although not much to say about the dialogue), and I know it's hard to count on a fantastic director behind animated gems like The Incredibles and the aforementioned underrated The Iron Giant. No doubt, he is a great director. But Tomorrowland just fallen short of how a great Disneyland-themed movie that inspired for over 60 fantastic years including Pirates of the Caribbean and Alice in Wonderland. Quite possibly be an underrated moment for Disney, so I should probably have to wait for it o DVD and Blu-Ray.",

Let me clarify what I mean, if you watch this movie in a theater you can enjoy yourself, but after you leave the theater and think about the film it won't make much sense. The lack of explanation leads to the film having a weak narrative, weak villains, and an overly complex premise, and a bunch of characters we see but don't understand.

George Clooney gives a masterful performance, and Britt Robinson gives a good performance too. The worst part of TomorrowLand is that it doesn't live up to the hype that it had. Brad Bird instead gave us a beautiful movie, but had no good film underneath that layer. TomorrowLand is inspired by Disney's famous theme park, and there is a slight vibe added to it.

Brad Bird is ambitious in his attempts, but results however in creating a disengaging movie with an array of negative aspects. Whilst it is at times visually impressive and quirky, it never lives up to its potential. The opening act successfully teases the audience into wanting to know more, but unfortunately the film suffers in its pacing to a large degree. The film feels like a ninety minute beginning to a movie, with little character development and lack of a clear narrative arc. The characters are poorly written, lacking in comedic humour, successful dialogue and basic human instincts and emotional drives. Not to mention the incredibly unusual relationship between the main characters and the lack of a proper antagonist. In terms of narrative arc, the film's pacing is a massive downfall. Whilst the opening act engages the audience's intrigues, the film slows down and eventually simmers out, up until the point that the viewer is disengaged in the already disappointing final act. Overall, Tomorrowland is contradictory, unrealistic, over political and lacking in any sense of adventure or fun promised in the trailers.",

I love a good Sci fi book or movie but it has to tip closer to the science and less on the fiction and this story was way more fiction. literally when the movie ended I was like meh and shrugged my shoulders... it left something to be desired. Though I would love to have one of those blaster guns they were pretty cool. I really liked seeing Hugh Laurie. I haven't seen him in much since House MD and it was nice to see him again. poor guy something always happening to his legs. lol Not too shabby!",
