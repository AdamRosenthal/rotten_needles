      "text": "Idris Elba must have looked through the script thinking \"Wow this movie looks horrible. But a least I play a creepy weirdo for a change\". No good Deed is about a devoted wife and mother of two finds her ideal life put in jeopardy when a smooth-talking stranger, who spins a tale about car trouble, manages to get inside her home and soon turns the invitation into a crisis. The biggest thing that made this movie horrible is the movie doesn't know how to tell a creepy story. Idris Elba and Taraji P. Henson did a great job in this movie, but the movie has the most stupidest character that I have seen so far this year since the Purge, and that is Taraji P. Henson character in this movie. She let's this strange crazy man into her own home and let this psychopath play with the kids just because she was trying to be nice. The movie has terrible writing and stupid character's that do stupid things. Overall this movie is a flat horror film with all the cliches in check.",
