Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson, and the other actresses who appeared in the first PP seem wasted here. There are some good acapella numbers, \"We Belong\" being a highlight. But the plot device that serves as the impetus for the movie does not make any sense, and is borderline offensive. Rebel Wilson, in an accident while performing, exposes her vagina to a live audience. The audience is horrified, and the Bellas are left in disgrace. This doesn't make any sense. It was an accident, and she showed her vagina, for pete's sake. She didn't murder an infant on stage.

Most of the movie is a bunch of jokes and not all of them are funny because they are rehashed and forced. This makes the movie pretty boring even though the guy from key and peele is pretty funny in this movie. Honestly, the movie wasn't awful, but it seems like this movie was made purely for money.

However, the film did not exceed or even meet the hype for that matter. The opening scene was absolutely hilarious, but unfortunately it did not set the tone for the rest of the movie. The humor felt forced and the film overall was not engaging. That being said though, the sentimental ending was a nice touch.",

The music in this film was good, but not as good as the first. Still consisted of mash-ups and included an original song. The plot is good, but a little too elaborate. I would have enjoyed more actual singing. Overall I would recommend the movie, but it is definitely not as good as the first one.",

      "text": "Gather around kids, your uncle KJ is going to tell you a story. Once upon a time, a movie called Pitch Perfect was released in theaters in the year 2012. It failed so miserably cause of it's poorly written script, unfunny humor, **** acting and very annoying characters. It was one of those comedy movies where you just want to puke. 3 years later, a sequel came out and guess what? IT WAS EVEN WORSE THAN THE FIRST! It has the same problems as the first except now, there's MORE annoying characters, there's MORE unfunny humor and there are MORE **** acting. During the entire movie, i just wanted to burn my eyes with acid, that's how bad it really was. The only good thing i liked about the movie was Snoop Dogg but sadly, it was just a cameo. I would rather watch the Fantastic Four reboot than this big pile of **** If i was Universal, i would cancel Pitch Perfect 3 and end this awful franchise.",
