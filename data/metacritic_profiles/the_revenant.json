The Cinematography in \"The Revenant\" is over the top, absolutely beautiful.  The film itself can be a little bloody and graphic so if you can't handle that sort of thing then its probably not for you.  True depiction of the era and the hardships of the time.  I thought as with DWW it shows the Indians could be compassionate, and most of the time we as white men were the ones taking advantage of them.  We were on their land and treated them badly.  Everyone in the theater was glued to the screen, might have been a tad long, but so enjoyable and well written that it didn't seem all that bad.  Great movie and glad to see they are making some movies in this genre again.  I really enjoyed the movie and was money well spent.  The only thing I could be critical of is perhaps the super human feats that the character managed at times, but you have to figure that happens on the big screen to make it more appealing!!",

We'll start with the best thing about this film. The cinematography. WOW does this film look AMAZING. Every shot is done with natural lighting and it really shows in the film. This movie is brutally realistic, from the bear attack to the final showdown between Hugh Glass and John Fitzgerald. This film is violent and dark and it's realism and amazing cinematography make the film a true delight to watch even if some of the scenes are very brutal. Now to the story, while good, isn't complicated at all and is very easy to follow. The characters are simple, you have the strong leader, Hugh Glass who is very looked up to by most in his group, Tom Hardy who plays the antagonist that leaves Hugh Glass for dead and murders his son right in front of him. While simple, these characters are portrayed very well by Leo and Tom Hardy and both men deserve a nod for their performances in this movie and while everyone screams for an Oscar for Leo, Tom Hardy did an amazing job in this film as well. What more is there to say about the story? Long story short, Glass is mauled by a bear, left for dead by John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy) who murders his son and now Glass must rise above the elements and survive a harsh and unforgiving environment with some aboriginal tribes thrown in as well along the way. It drags on way too long and made the film feel much longer than it really was and by the last 10-15 minutes it was feeling like it was never going to end. As a movie, The Revenant would receive maybe a 5 or 6. It's simple, drags on a little too long, but the characters are interesting enough to keep it going strong. As a film, The Revenant really shines. To the atmosphere, cinematography, and how realistic it is, it's one you have to see. It'll leave you thinking \"how did they do that? how could they get that shot?\". The bear attack in particular gave me chills and it tried to do that and it succeeded in doing so. It's one of those movies you can watch maybe once or twice a year, but it is an amazing film even with a long run time.",

Despite being the main attraction, his dialogue is so far apart and and between so much action that he's given little opportunity to win our hearts. Even when these opportunities do present themselves the writing is unfortunately much thinner than what you'd expect from a role played by the best actor of the year. For these unfortunate reasons we shall all prepare ourselves for yet another March full of \"Leo has no statue\" memes. Perhaps one in which the Oscar is mauling him instead of a bear. Hardy however, is outstanding, making the best of every scene and warranting himself a nomination of his own, though it's doubtful he'll get it. Even Poulter does nobly in what must have been a daunting list of co-stars. The only role I found distasteful is that of my fellow ginger's. Though Gleeson made my list of those to watch after Ex Machina, this performance makes it two in-a-row that I've felt he was miscast and for largely the same reasons (the other being Star Wars). Gleeson seems to be stepping into roles suited better for men twice his age. Though he looked the part here much better than in space, he still lacks the authority to create a conviction from within a leader.",

The scenery is amazing; the graphics of the bear mauling impeccable; the intermittent gnashing of teeth (DiCaprio's) punctuate scenes like the icy blast of winter's first freeze, cutting the viewer to the core. No doubt, his performance was impressive, and he committed to the role with an intensity that skewers the viewer's soul, much as the computer-generated bear did to DiCaprio's nearly frozen limbs. The story itself misses the mark historically, as the real Hugh Glass did not have a son; however, the overlying, timeless theme of righting someone's wrong rings as true in the 1820's as it does today. It is that drive to make someone accountable for his actions that keeps the viewer glued to the screen from start to finish. One can't help but wonder what he or she would do in a similar situation, and how he or she at one time has also felt like Hugh Glass, wishing to make someone pay for another person's wrongdoing. In addition to DiCaprio's performance, Tom Hardy proved a force to be reckoned with, chewing each scene as hard as he did the wad of tobacco he slid carefully between his teeth and cheek intermittently. It was his performance that was perhaps the most overlooked, and the final reckoning between Hardy and DiCaprio was a cinematic masterpiece.",

However, this very physically demanding performance does not wow as it should. The almost total lack of dialogue for the character results in viewer alienation and a lack of empathy. One watches the horrific events unfold, but with a dispassionate detachment and some distaste. Director Alejandro G Inarritu creates a wonderful atmosphere environmentally. The locations, beautiful but forbidding, are awesomely captured by cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki whose work here is just stunning. The film is worth seeing for his achievement alone. Also many scenes have a visceral quality to them, none more so than the Indian and bear attacks which both happen within the first half an hour and are excitingly and shockingly staged. Visual effects for the bear are incredibly good. After this events meander from one bloody scene to the next leaving one somewhat anaesthetised to the grisliness of it all. Suspension of disbelief is also a requirement in accepting just how quickly DiCaprio is back on his feet after his mauling by the bear, let alone scaling mountains (one sequence shows him at the top of a mountain unable to walk; the next scene shows him drinking from the lake below!). In support, Tom Hardy also disappoints, but this is once again mainly due to a vocalisation of his character that is often unintelligible. As we all know DiCaprio will win his long overdue Oscar here, and there is no denying that he is a deserving recipient. It\u2019s just a shame that he will be rewarded, as happens all too often by the conventional and short sighted Academy, for this performance over one of his previous more deserving roles.",

Either the bear scene, or Leonardo DiCaprio's character covering himself inside of a horse's dead body, it was friggin brutal. The bear attack was especially frightening. What I like about this scene is how the bear interacts with Glass. He first attacks him, smells him and goes away for a few seconds, than Glass grabs his gun and shoots the bear, although the bear attacks him again, and shakes the poor guy like dogs do to the rugs. Then the bear stops one more time, and few seconds later, the bear takes his shot one more time, but Glass stabs it, and they both fall off, with the bear on top of Glass's body. It's amazing how they edited and choreographed this particular bit.",

Though The Revenant is an exceptionally well presented visual showpiece, it is also entirely nonsensical, ham-fistedly delivering its narrative, which like its protagonist's quest, is entirely devoid of any deep significance when it's through. This is mostly due to a disconnect in logical proceedings, which wouldn't be too big a deal if the film wasn't attempting a realistic portrayal of the world. From the moment of the bear attack all suspension of disbelief is totally gone, leaving you only to shake your head as Glass survives countless fatal situations, and crosses roads with so many people important to plots surrounding him purely by coincidence. Oh, it's because he's the best tracker that side of the country, now it all makes sense -- except for the part where he's been shredded to ribbons by a bear with only wet clothes on his back and in the forty below nights of the frontier. While the visuals and soundtrack accompanying the dream sequences were some of the highlights of the movie, I felt they became a bit heavy handed, adding different visual themes without any real substance. Some leaps in logic cast doubt over the final events of the movie, which really sticks out over whatever symbolism the filmmakers were trying to achieve with those scenes. Without spoiling anything, I will say that the climax of the film is well executed, which is good since it was the only really big payoff to look forward to. As good as it looks, it's never as immersive or as symbolic as it wants to be with its cliched and nonsensical plot, as well as few noteworthy performances. Special commendations go to Tom Hardy, who excellently portrays the only well established character in the entire film. His character is the only one I found to have inspired any curiosity, and that's a shame since he's the villain. Some great visuals aside, it's a miserable experience that strains your senses (particularly your ability to hear what characters are saying - my experience seemed to have a very poor sound mix with muffled, mumbling voices).",

The best performance is by Tom Hardy who I couldn't tell was playing the role until they ran the credits at the end. I was amazed that this actor could transform himself with a heavy southern accent and acting that truly made you hate him. I had seen him play a young Patrick Stewart in a Star Trek movie and couldn't believe this was the same person in this movie. Totally believable as a redneck with a southern twang, when in reality he is English with a heavy English accent. Few actors amaze me like that.

Leonardo DiCaprio amazes again with his brutal and anchoring performance struggling to survive while the commitment between him and Tom Hardy into their respective roles have successfully turned the director's artistic visions into an immersive life of death journey.

The film was directed by Alejandro Gonzalez Innarritu  (\"Birdman\") who, with Mark L. Smith,  co-wrote the screenplay based on the novel by Michael Punke. Although shot in Canada and Argentina, the film attempts to depict the challenges of a South Dakota winter n 1823. The word \"revenant\" is derived from the French word \"revenir\" (i.e. to return) and literally means the return of the spirit from the dead. This is the plight of Mr. DiCaprio\u2019s character as he struggles across the barren icy wasteland for over 2 and \u00bd hours of viewing time. The audience also feels his pain and anguish since it too has to suffer through this ordeal as it is forced to endure a tedious and overlong excursion through the cold and unforgiving wilderness. The difference of course is that Mr. DiCaprio was paid for his suffering while the audience was not. Mr. DiCaprio\u2019s character is enmeshed in a thin story line and basically has a non-verbal role as the script requires him to do a great amount of crawling and some groaning but, unfortunately, these do not necessarily rise to the level of great entertainment.",

I felt that the film had great character development as  well, like I felt like I was really attached to Leos character. we see him fight off bears and survive countless times in situations that would definitely kill a normal human being. That was a downpoint of the film because the bear attack would have paralyzed Leos character for sure, let alone him being able to walk,crawl,swim,or basic activities a person has to do to survive. I overlooked this mistake though since it was when the main plot was introduced into the story, that this might be one of my favorite films  of 2016 so far. Leos son gets murdered by Tom Hardy's character(Fitzgerald), and throughout the film,DiCaprio, struggles to survive but is influenced by revenge that he pushes through. The only thing about this movie is that it was really great film, but its defiantly a one time watch and a MUST SEE.",

      "text": "While this film is well shot that's about all I can praise this extremely long winded and boring film for. While the opening was interesting, and the first half-hour gave us an incredibly visceral war scene that is frankly a piece of art in and of itself; the rest of the film was just torture-porn of the worst kind. Leonardo DiCaprio did a good job here but that's not enough to save this film. The films plot can be summarised as, \"nature beats up Leonardo DiCaprio for two hours while he's near death after he gets mauled by an unrealistic looking CGI bear\". This is pretty much the only key event in the film and the rest is just a long drawn out torture scene as we watch poor Leo grimace and strain at the camera for hours. It's almost painful to watch and not because you're sympathising with the character, but because you're not interested in watching someone languish in pain for yet another run-on scene. Honestly, I would question the emotional stability of those who enjoy this, as I feel it would take some pretty entrenched sadism to get pleasure out of watching this.",

It's SO GORGEOUS, sure the film has it's other strong suits but the direction (Inarittu) and cinematography (Lubezki), two categories it won Oscars in, is so overwhelming I couldn't understand why a certain section of the audience did not find this a good watch. It is a very old school film it has this strong 70's vibe where the story is not told and is left for you to figure out. I watched this with a friend who did not enjoy this as much and suggested that the movie would have been better if DiCaprio's character Hugh Glass narrated in the film and spelled out his ordeals to the audience. I called my friend a pleb because I am a high and mighty jerk like that but on a serious note while a narration would have helped with the casual audience, it would also promote spoon feeding hand holding which has become the norm of today's films. The performances were great and a movie like this falls apart if the performances are not good they are the only thing connecting the audience to the film. Well deserved Oscar for DiCaprio, arguably career best performance from him, Tom Hardy was great too shame no Oscar though, some scenes were so intense I could feel it taking a mental toll on me of which the bear mauling scene was on the forefront. Overall a very visceral movie which used only natural light while filming and will stand the test of time, something which this year's winner Spotlight cannot claim.",

Shooting the bear after the first mauling is incredibly stupid as well. Even that doesn't strain credibility as much as the repeated immersions in icy water which he somehow survives or his amazing ability to keep his head out of water while wrapped in sodden clothing and bearskin. I've done winter camping and I just don't buy it - get that wet and particularly in that state of injury and you're toast - or ice cubes really. Then it's just one cliche' and deus ex machina after another. Is there ANY survival cliche' that's not thrown in here? Miraculous buffalo and a miraculous Indian. Miraculous rescued native maiden who will ALMOST keep him for sartin' death later. A mumbling evil Texan. A wide eyed boy. And the acting ... the Oscar was most definitely a career Oscar. Let's not forget the cinematography which is in love with itself to the point of pain. How many shots up through the trees with sighing wind can you take? My limit is considerably less than I got here. The splitting open of the horse to stay warm - followed by the dressing in clothing that has to be either frozen or sodden depending on how much of a thaw we're supposed to believe that really is. This guy has to have an interior nuclear reactor to thaw himself out again. Yes, after the bear mauling I became increasingly bored and angry.

Though some of the wide-angle shots remind you that you're watching a film, the emphasis on realism is absolutely transporting. Some of the best action scenes are shot entirely with one take as well which adds to their immediacy. The performances by DiCaprio and Hardy are top-notch and both truly disappear into their roles.

This is Inarritu's best work by far, beating out the gimmicky \"Birdman\" and the visionary but depressing \"Babel\". A true gem of cinema and easily among the top 3 films of 2015. Go see it in the best theater possible!!",

From its beyond beautiful cinematography to its gorgeous locations, it's a real cinematic movie that traps you in this environment. The cast (particularly the two leads) is fantastic. Tom Hardy gives arguably the best performance of his career in my opinion. He's an antagonist with layers and even brought unpredictability to his character. But Leonardo DiCaprio, is what you go to see. Saying that he gives a great performance is an understatement. He is Hugh Glass. Not once did I think to myself that I'm watching Leo give a performance. He felt like a real person! Maybe it's not my favorite performance of his but it's beyond damn good to say the least. I loved that it was a revenge story and one that makes you clinch your fists during the big combat sequences. You feel the brutality! And you feel Hugh Glass wanting to seek his revenge. It even has really good pace for a two and a half hour long movie. I never got bored because there was always something at stake. I will say that the very end felt a little too ambiguous for its own good. Other than that, I believe you have a strong contender for best picture at the oscars. Overall, it's a brutally beautiful movie with grit and heart pounding intensity. I'm going to give \"The Revenant\" an A!",

      "text": "Loosely based on the life of 19th century frontiersman Hugh Glass, The Revenant is a brutal yet visually stunning western with one of Leonardo DiCaprio's best performances yet. The film follows Glass after he is mauled by a bear and left for dead by his fellow fur traders. One of the frontiersmen, John Fitzgerald, kills his son, and Glass voyages over 200 miles to exact revenge on him. The Revenant is one of the most violent movies I've seen from 2015, although the incredible scenery and cinematography also make it one of the most astonishing movies to look at. It combines some intense, difficult-to-watch scenes with amazing scenery which makes it one of the most beautiful violent films I've seen. Leo's committed and demanding performance is certainly one of the best of his career especially because of the lack of the dialog in the film. The 156-minute running time, relentless brutality and limited dialog does take a bit of a commitment to finish, but The Revenant is a masterfully directed film that makes the most of its subject matter's intriguing story.",

As in Birdman, here he experiments with shooting and cinematography; which are one of the few things that goes well in this picture. The camera is placed precisely in the moment of both psychological and physical stress, the director chooses it at ground level and with close up to tired faces, suffering eyes, dirty hands and demolishing wounds; in order to reflect the Greek tragedy that faces the protagonist. The thing is that it does not go any further than that. There is no plot whatsoever, the script is poor, the soundtrack not outstanding and the outcome is simple and very predictable, making these 156 minutes a fight for survival, not only for the protagonist, but also for the viewer. It\u2019s important to mention that DiCaprio\u2019s performance is OK, nothing special, if he is awarded is just because the Academy has a debt with him. On the other hand, Hardy is really the one people should be cheering, amazing performance, no critiques. So in summary, lazy movie, probably the worst work of Inarritu.",

I think the biggest problem with this movie is that it doesn't know whether it wants to be a survival film or a revenge film. It introduces itself as a revenge film but 90% of time, it seems that its just a survival film. Only at the very end does it suddenly switch back to a revenge film. And the plot doesn't really go anywhere in terms of character development and story. Its more or less just telling us \"DiCaprio has to go through a lot, look at how much he has to go through\" so much to the point where it's like: Yeah we get it, is the plot/story going to advance anywhere?",

DiCaprio does a great job at the main character Glass, and his reactions to what happens to him is basically the whole movie. The pacing is a bit slow and, for a close to 3 hour movie, it can be hard to sit through some of the more dull moments that happen. However the wonderful and gory fights scenes take the cake and deliver a very realistic way of fighting, whether it be against man or beast. I definitely enjoyed this movie more than Birdman as the focus on, basically, one character was far more precise here than in Birdman with it's many different scene stealing characters. Tom Hardy does a good job as the title villain but his thick accent can make understanding some of his lines a chore.

      "text": "The Revenant is one of the most epic yet simple films that I have ever seen. This film is long but there is never a part of the film that feels like it doesn't need to be there. Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu already showed us with Birdman last year that he is one of the best directors out there. Its only been a year and Inarritu WILL be in the winners circle again this year. I feel that The Revenant is even better than Birdman. The film is so raw and powerful and its visually stunning regardless of the scene. Leonardo DiCaprio has become an actor that we expect nothing but excellence. Not only is this one of DiCaprio's best performances but I think that there is almost no way that he does not take home the Oscar for Best Actor. The Revenant may sweep many of the major categories at the Oscars. I think it will win Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor and perhaps even Best Supporting as Tom Hardy is excellent in this film as well and its one of his best performances so far. The Revenant is outstanding filmmaking and it may only improve with more watches.",

It has moments that you simply feel frightened, seriously, that bear scene is something truly special! The acting was also very good, this is probably in top 3 DiCaprio's performances and i swear, if he doesn't win the Oscar then i guess the world is completely doomed. Hardy was also a great presence for his villainous role that also earned him a well deserved nom for Supporting Actor. The only thing that is stoping me of giving a 10 is because of its story but it's something minimal, guys i definitely recommend this one to check out. MUCH BETTER THAN **** WARS!!",

DiCaprio makes you feel many emotions throughout from sadness to hatred. This is a fabulous film to kick start 2016.

      "text": "Leonardo DiCaprio never stroke me as the actor who gets in the mind of a character so much that I can only see the character on screen. His inability to properly display accents, an overuse of body-language and yelling, and his generic grimace often made me go, \"Yep that's him alright\". Though with this role I see him much differently. It could be the awful facial hair, but I think it's rooted in the fact that he barely ever speaks. And the character is spent mostly crawling or limping, so the wild gestures are kept in check. Then when the movie gets tense and he really needs to struggle it looks more convincing, raw, and even natural. And speaking of things that look natural let us briefly summarize this cinematography and camera work. it is widely known that film used a lot of natural lighting, the Barry Lyndon technique that just isn't usually seen today. It payed off. I understand that it was incredibly difficult to film and required a lot of extra work, but it works. I sat in the theater (not in IMAX) thinking, \"if i visited this place this is exactly what it would look like.  I would say that the film has a grey aesthetic, but the backdrops showing a crisp clear image of a foggy forest help it all blend naturally. It is really contributes to 2015's amazing run of beautiful films. Out of all the films this year, Mad Max: Fury Road and this were the best looking. The camera work is also very repetitive, but interesting nonetheless. The film uses juxtaposition all throughout. We may start on a wide helicopter shot of a mountain, only to do a one take zoom to DiCaprio trudging through the snow. Maybe we will have the sun reflect off the camera showing nature in all of it's glory, only to have 'man' use it as a playground for gritty, blood soaked battles. The film likes to go from the larger picture to the little details. I find it to work because we can see how personal and up close the tense situations are. Also the camera feels married to the idea panning. Every sequence involving a dilemma is likely to show the dilemma through a pan to the left or right. It got on my nerves, but really didn't kill anything. Some of the things that are going to turn people are the sequences where DiCaprio is alone and must survive. There is two good character interactions, and one self inflicted medical treatment that felt fresh, but not much else. Giving the film props, it kept with its identity of slow one take shots, DiCaprio not speaking, and beautiful cinematography. Unfortunately they were focused on things that we would have implied anyway.    Nothing note worthy or interesting happens with any other character after DiCaprio is on his own. But the characters are still believable and developed well enough. Tom Hardy, especially, pulls of the paranoid, racist, rebel with charm even though it has been done a million times. Sometimes the movie will have a bit of a mixed bag with how much Hugh Glass (Leonardo DiCaprio) hallucinates, and the hallucinations aren't exactly rocking my mind. The film does a much better job making battles have real weight. The first battle and sequence with the bear is done remarkably well; every hit feels like a crushing blow. Overall the film suffers when it has to have survival, which can be a real problem  for people. Though if you excuse that then you are left with a beautifully looking, drama that does a lot to impress the eyes.",

So when watching the film, I noticed that it was straying awfully far away from what was happening in the book and at first I was disappointed. However, by the time the film ended, I understood more why this was the case. First off, the credits read \"based in part on the novel by Michael Punke\", so that was a dead giveaway right there. Also, Punke couldn't promote, do any publicity, or even be on set or aid in the making of the film due to the fact that he's currently an ambassador to the World Trade Organization, which prevented him from helping the filmmakers include many of the events from the novel. I also realized that since so little is known about what happened with the real-life Hugh Glass that multiple stories and plot points can be made up about him. Even Punke admitted to having to make up several events that were in the novel. So basically Punke was telling his own version of what Glass might've been through or experienced, while the filmmakers were telling their own as well. For these reasons, I'm able to forgive the fact that the film drastically strayed from the novel. In fact, the more I thought about it after the film ended, the more I realized that I actually liked the film better, because the third act in the novel kind of strayed from the revenge plot that it so specifically advertised and went more towards the justice route, whereas the film stuck firmly with the revenge plot, which made for a much more exciting and satisfying third act that truly made the film a great story of revenge! In addition to this, everything about this film was absolutely perfect and phenomenal! The gorgeous cinematography and landscape shots throughout, the hauntingly effective and powerful score, the brutal and unflinching violence and action, etc. And of course, the acting from everyone involved was outstanding! Leonardo DiCaprio will win his long overdue Oscar for this film, mark my words!!! Tom Hardy also delivers a very aggressive performance. Even Domhnall Gleeson and Will Poulter make the most of their characters and screentime. So overall, director Alejandro G. Inarritu does it again with a film that's just as intriguing and engaging as his last film Birdman was! It's undoubtedly one of the most impressive, powerful and memorable films of 2015!",

      "text": "Okay, you riddle me this...How does one man go through all of this \"based on true events\", and still live? Unless he was born on a planet far, far away? Spoiler Alert! Do not read this, unless you have actually seen the movie. First off, I felt bad about the cubs, the Pawnee girl, really bad about the son, really, bad about the Pawnee friend who helped Glass, and really, really bad about the horse )okay, really bad for the mama bear too). Now then, the real question is how? How can a human being attacked by a bear, suffer what appears to be a broken leg/ankle/foot/ uh, punctured lung, ripped off skin, nearly ripped out throat, and then live after going down rapids, wade ashore in this broken state, and then walk/limp away? Even after all of that water rapid ride (that would normally destroy a canoe, kill the average person, Glass still has the ability to have the stone and flint to make a fire AND no additional physical added problems. The flint and stone weren't lost while he was tossed around like clothes in a washing machine? And even though he was total submerged in water (hypothermia didn't play any part in this movie, it was ignored), the animal skins he was wearing, miraculously dried perfectly. The topper (one of far too many in this movie) is when he is riding a horse away from his attackers and they soar off a cliff. The horse goes off one way (lucky? for Glass) and drops to his bloody death nearby Glass. The horse is a total bloodied mess after the fall from the cliff. But \"Super Glassman\" drops anywhere from 150 to 300 feet, falls on his face in the snow pack, and walks away without any additional damage to his already damaged body (not one additional scratch or broken...anything). Amazing! Then, he strips down, makes a bed in the gutted out horse, when he wakes, he is amazingly \"cleaned up\", puts his clothes back on to go on his way. What planet was Glass from originally? Does he know Kal-el? Do they \"do lunch\"? It was almost too much to repeatedly see L.C. ala Glass with those baby blue eyes and the crystal clear whites of his eyes looking like he just got out of bed at a four star hotel. There's more, but it's not worth mentioning. This based on true facts script/story must have been about a number of men and put into one man's life. That's the only way it could possibly have happened. There was far too much (\"you have to be kidding\" under the audiences breath throughout the movie) to make this movie real. The last shot was the final slap in the face. Picture this, one more shot of L.C. looking into the lens with nice clear, rested blue eyes, and then fade to black. Always a good way to end a movie by having the main character starring into the lens. That makes us all feel so warm and fuzzy. If the movie gets any awards, it should only be for sound and photography. Set dressing looses here because of the well patterned snow pack, the trails that were far to tread on where nearly driven snow should have existed at that time, the non-existing branches in the tree and on the ground from that fall both the horse and \"body\" did in the one mentioned scene above. Do we see a sequel in the near future? The Revenant II, Return of The Revenant, The Revenge of the Revenant, The Revenant Prequel... (at least we have to hope it will not be picked up as a series) ugh!",

It is incredibly gripping, full of beautiful shots, and very dark with outstanding performances by Leo, Tom Hardy, and the rest of the crew. It must be understood however that those looking for a 1800s action thriller will be disappointed as it is simply not that kind of movie, nor was it meant to be. This is simply a story of redemption and revenge, and survival against all odds, and while it has action the majority of the movie consists of Leo walking around just breathing between the action scenes. It is a very slow paced movie, which adds to the realism in many ways and allows for awe inspiring shots of the landscape. The fight scenes are incredibly realistic and refreshing as it is no longer simply a bunch of choreographed punches and well timed hits like all Hollywood films, but rather all out brawls that look unorganized and lifelike. The only faults I give it are that the movie doesn't have a consistent pace, as in the beginning we couldn't miss a character blink and the final 10-15 minutes cover like a 1-2 day period. Also at times there are scenes that are too long and unimportant. You'll spend 3 minutes watching Leo slowly ascend a hill just to see bison run around on a plain. Despite these flaws the Revenant is a movie definitely worth the watch, and rightfully delivered Leo is first Oscar award for best lead actor",

I absolutely love the cinematography of this film. The fact they kept the camera so grounded and relied on long shots really made me feel connected and immersed to what was happening on screen. It gives the film an extra layer of grittiness that really helps it to shine. A must see film for any film buff.",

The rest is Werner Herzog rip offs (trying to recreate the grueling filming of Fitzcarraldo and showing us the thing that Herzog doesn't show you in Grizzly Man), overindulgent camera work and a plodding, flat script.  Oscar-bait written all over it, there is little story or character development. deCaprio fails to make you forget that he is deCaprio ACTING his most Oscar worthy and doing this film to pretend like he is in a situation that in reality he would not have the first idea what to do in, with a crew waiting with a blanket and a hot drink nearby. Voyeuristic, grim and pointless.",
