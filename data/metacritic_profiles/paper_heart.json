I also never felt like I really was given a chance to get to know  the characters, which is always a pretty big downer. Not to say there aren't any cute, funny,genuinely good moments, but that's just the problem:they're only moments, and they're pretty out of place.  A lot of the movie also relies on the quirkiness of the two leads, a lot of times it was like, \"Well, this scene is getting dull, let's just get a laugh at how awkward Micheal Cera is.\" It might not be a waste of time to see this movie, but it was a let down for me.",
