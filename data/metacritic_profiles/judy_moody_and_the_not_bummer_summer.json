Things look up when, inspired and aided by her free-spirited Aunt Opal (Heather Graham), Judy comes up with a wacky list of dares and adventures to be undertaken by both her and her faraway friends.  Nothing hugely original here, but Beatty (an Australian actress doing a flawless American accent) is appealing, Graham is tremendously sexy and loveable, and in one of the more surprising bits of casting this summer, Jaleel White - yes, I'm talking iconic TV nerd Steve Urkel - is genuinely charming as Judy's teacher.  I know the reviews are crummy and the Megacritic scores reflect that, but I'd take this over Mr. Popper's Penguins or (God help me) Transformers: Dark Of The Moon any day.",

The CG graphics were a fun nod to a world-gone-gamified - and, aside from some unnecessary fixation on poop jokes (of course, getting some of the best \"ewwws!\" and laughs from the kids), the film provided a playful romp with decent messages.  Loved that Aunt Opal is a walking creativity-maven.  And if this film gets kids reading the book series it was based on, that's not such a bummer summer either.",
