      "text": "Film that tries to be independent, cult movie and almost it succeeds. \"The Canyons\" reminds me of \"The Other Woman\" or the Spanish film \"Allegre ma non troppo\". Lindsay Lohan recovers some of its former essence. The biggest problem with the film is not the script or the director, not, the problem is the partner of Lohan, James Deen. What does a porn actor starring in a movie? His performance is like a homemade short films actor.",
