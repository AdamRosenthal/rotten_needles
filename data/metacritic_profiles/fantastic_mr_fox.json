In fact, one would wonder why anyone would bother making a stop motion movie, as opposed to a CGI movie. The reason, is that stop motion has an odd, old fashioned, hand made feel to it. And somehow, that feel has been captured and placed into this movie, and it's not just evident in the animation. Fantastic Mr. Fox is inspired from Roald Dahl's picture book by the same name. The film follows the story of Mr. Fox, who starts stealing farmer's merchandise again, without telling his wife. Mr. Fox has been planning some \"great heist,\" despite his promises to his wife, claiming he would quit. Soon, the three meanest farmers of them all (Farmers Boggis, Bunce, and Bean), decide to end Mr. Fox's reign once and for all. The film's dry humor is both witty and hilarious. No movie in the world can stand up to the unique humor that Fantastic Mr. Fox displays. I give points to the outstanding voice talents (namely for George Clooney and Meryl Streep), and the comedic score by Alexandre Desplat. The animation is spectacular. By far the best I've seen in a stop motion film. It's truly fantastic. Even for stop motion, it looks incredibly good fashioned, and that is a very good thing. Unlike the book, however, this is not a piece of entertainment I can recommend for younger children. It's too dark, and they probably won't get many of the jokes (they may get a kick out of all the fuzzy animals, however). This is more of an older kids and parents flick. Fantastic Mr. Fox is fun, entertaining, unique, and visually wonderful. It is not hard to understand why they call it \"Fantastic\" Mr. Fox.",

There is such a wealth of humour in here, so many great lines, silly repeating jokes and a great love of language.  Its main failing seem to be that it isn't really a kids film, and isn't really much to do with the original books, more just a hanger to place a Wes Anderson movie on.  And seriously, anyone who rates Pixar animation over this really needs to get a grip (and this is coming from someone who really loves Pixar movies)",

The animation is also great and I really enjoyed the look and feel of the film. On top of that, this one is very Wes Anderson in terms of the way it was filmed and in the story itself, as on the surface it is about a fox who steals chickens and other things from nearby farmers, but it goes much deeper than that, allowing it to be a great film for all ages to enjoy.

It has a mature edge, not only in its content (characters swear frequently, but each word is replaced with the word \"cuss\"), but also in its style. The uniqueness and strange nature never get in the way. Stop motion animals and Wes Anderson seem to be a match made in heaven. The film works very well in just about every aspect, it would be difficult not to enjoy it. The characters are surprisingly great for a family film, and the comedy is appealing to just about any audience imaginable. All in all, it's impressive that Anderson could make such a blended and unique film, without letting the strangeness interfere with his style.

I don't know why that is the case with so many of them, but it is.  The animation is gorgeous and seems to be a mix of stop motion and CGI.  And the script - eh - based on a Roald Dahl tale, it focuses on a crafty fox who raises the ire of some nasty farmers by stealing their chickens and cider.  This causes a backlash, and it becomes all out war between cute critters and creepy farmers.  For some reason, top actors like Clooney and Schwartzman were given the voice-over roles, which ends up being more distracting than effective.  The best of them was Wolodarsky as the shy, goofy possum.  The music choices were weird and took me out of the film.  A word about Wes Anderson - I know I'm supposed to like his slight, whimsical movies, but I don't.  The humor is bland and the stories are usually pointless.
