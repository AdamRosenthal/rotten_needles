The story is annoying, pretentious and very far from being philosophic, it has less depth than Disney and if you are thinking that this could be the next \"dead poets society\" then think again. The effects could have been done in microsoft paint and the acting leaves you totally unable to suspend your disbelief and instead of craving the pathetic and predictable \"twist\" at the end I found myself wishing it would end. Without wanting to spoil the plot I highly recommend that you dont bother watching this movie and if for some reason you want to find out for yourself then one word of advice, If you think its cr*p after the first time they do the imaginary exercise dont hang in there for the next two times they do it. It only gets worse. This movie is the disappointing equivalent of going to the toilet for a satisfactory poo and only letting out a wispy fart.",

The apocalyptic scenarios are thought up by brilliant philosophy students who make the movie what it is. Intelligent, well thought out, and very entertaining.

I as a lover for complex ideas that make you think and as a lover for survival truly enjoyed this film although I wasn't hooked to begin with nor did I think it was going to be good. The film is set on the premise of thought and thinking ahead during an apocalypse. Every student in a class is given a role and that role is then what defines them as everyone has to decide who goes inside a bunker where only 10 can live. This film isn't what you expect and like I said isn't for all but the ideas around it are great and the different ideas you can get out of this film are also great. I gave it an 8 for being unique and enjoyable as there is also room for improvements on the idea (Sequel, game). The film is also very confusing as the way it is laid out and directed may confuse you.",
