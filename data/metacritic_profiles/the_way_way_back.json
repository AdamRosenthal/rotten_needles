Toni Collette, Steve Carell, and AnnaSophia Robb are also all very good in this one, though really the whole cast brings their A game. The film is well directed and well told for the most part and really has very few faults.

While he is in all his waterpark gear and flirting with the e employees, we almost forget that he played a crazy prisoner in \"The Green Mile\". Toni Collette and Steve Carrell make up a talented supporting cast. The direction, editing, cinematography, and script are all on par to make for a very enjoyable film.",

Steve Carrel shows he is more then just a character to laugh at and can deliver a performance unlike any other he has done before while still being believable. Sam Rockwell made this movie wonderful along with his supporting cast and excellent writing from Nat Faxon and Jim Rash. From start to finish I enjoyed this movie even though I wanted to punch the main character in the face to toughen him up. I couldn't help but smile all the way through. i would give it an 8-8.5 but this rating system doesn't let me do decimals.",
