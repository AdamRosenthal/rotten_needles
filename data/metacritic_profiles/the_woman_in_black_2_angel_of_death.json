Also the VERY  unnecessary love story subplot in the film...it was very out of place. Just because the main protagonist is female DOESNT mean there MUST BE a love interest. THANK THE TRAILER FIR NOT SPOILING A LOT because scenes in the trailer that looked like a match for the movie were edited so some scenes from the trailer didn't match the movie still leaving surprises.",

I've seen worst! the film has under developed characters (which is not a good thing for a horror flick), the film's purposes is reacting upon jump scares. The only thing good about this film Director Tom Harper's Gothic vision. I get it the actor's try but Jon Croker's script shows minimum details in the film than the other one. It's scary and unoriginal. Phoebe  FOX is a good heroine for the film it's just there is nothing she can do with the script in the way. The film is unlike able and i wanted the children to die in the film! Grade D-",

      "text": "If you're gonna put the name of a character in the title, it'd be nice if that character was actually in the movie. I'm still not completely sure if this was actually meant to be a sequel to 2012's The Woman in Black, or if the producers just tacked \"The Woman in Black 2\" in front of the original title to make a quick buck. Nevertheless, I'll still treat this film as a sequel, as it does contain the house from the original movie. Angel of Death takes place 40 years after The Woman in Black and is about a woman who starts an orphanage inside the notorious Eel Marsh House, which is said to be haunted by a ghost. If anything, Angel of Death feels like the second act of the original movie, in which Arthur Kipps is lurking around the creepy old house, stretched to 98 minutes. Even scares that were very unsettling and scary in The Woman in Black are reused in the sequel to a much less powerful effect. While there were a few admittedly creepy scenes, they were ruined by unnecessary jump scares. I'd also like to point out that the woman in black never appears in the movie until the last 15 minutes, and she only makes 3 or 4 appearances as cheap jump shocks. I was hoping that at least the time period in which the movie takes place could possibly save this from being a total disaster since it takes place during World War II. It's the perfect opportunity to tell a compelling story about the tragedies of war while also being an effective ghost story, but the war themes are dropped within the first ten minutes. I think the most shocking thing about Angel of Death is the fact that it's a ghost story that lacks both a ghost and a story. If you're looking for a good, moody, atmospheric haunted house movie, then I suggest 2012's The Woman in Black. Skip Angel of Death.",

Pues bien, La dama de negro 2 es una pelicula predecible, donde ya sabes lo que va a pasar. Con una duraci\u00f3n de 1 hora con 30 minutos, la pelicula se siente eterna, pues tiene un desarrollo lento, es decepcionante como ofrece mas de lo mismo y no nos ofrece mas historia sobre la dama de negro. Lo unico que puedo decir a resaltar es la fotograf\u00eda y la post producci\u00f3n, es impecable, es una mala pelicula pero se \"disfruta\" verla. No supera a su primera parte, mejor esp\u00e9rala en Netflix o en DVD.",
