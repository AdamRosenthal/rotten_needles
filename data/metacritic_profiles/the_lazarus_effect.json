Wilde gave a subtle and very unsettling performance to make her character very memorable. Sarah Bolger was another strong part of the cast, and she gave it her all when her character is being stalked by a demonic Olivia Wilde. The rest of the actors were decent yet forgettable. This movie has a lot of great ideas, but there wasn't any room for any of those ideas to fully develop themselves due to the criminally short 83 minute running time. Had the movie been about 15 minutes longer, those themes could have been developed better. There is a twist at the end of the movie that does explain a few of the more questionable plot points. I jumped a few times, I cringed a few times, and I rolled my eyes a few times, but the Lazarus Effect does its job in a decently creepy yet forgettable fashion.",

The pros are the fantastic cast, the plot idea of bringing back the dead (ending in a Pet Cemetery style regret), and the overall look/feel of the movie. The cons are failure to reach expectations (it had so much potential), confusion and lack of explanation (what really happened in that burning apartment? Why was she seeing firemen in the end?), and the sudden fast-forward in how quick everything progressed. Once one of them died, the rest just started dropping like flies. Before reaching the middle of the movie, everything just started happening at once. It felt so rushed.",
