Before I get to the flaws, let me tell why do I like this one better than its' predecessor. The stakes are higher and the pace faster, which adds the effect if in IMAX 3D. The actors are fine as well as the first one. Now, the flaws. Some scenes are a bit clunky. It's because of the script, which is the strength and the weakness of this movie. You'll see it when you do. But that doesn't stop me from liking it because it is plot-wise. Of course, that's just my opinion.

Wait sounds like Veronica Roth did a blurred lines rip off ! Insurgent is 115 minutes of exploding pixels, dark dreams, and inept soldiers in armored tanks unable to chase down three teens on foot - escaping without a scratch. Toto had more personality then any actor in this fiasco. Then everyone runs to the door of the new world as I ran to the exit. To be continued. How sad!",

Most of the good of the first movie still plays here, but I couldn't help but feel like Insurgent sold itself short.  The big reveal toward the end is intriguing, but the problem I had was I wasn't as invested in the story by the time I got there.  If the Divergent Series is going to avoid disaster, the folks in charge of making this movie need to push the cast and writers harder.  There are too many inconsistencies in the acting performances to sell the emotional turmoil that is supposed to be eating up Tris and select other cast members.  Basically, there is no anchor as Tris is no Jennifer Lawrence and thus the film doesn't force audiences to be immersed into this fictional world.  I'll still watch the rest of the series, but it will be a tragedy if the next pair of films can't learn from the mistakes of this particular chapter.",

In what was once Chicago, the war between the factions has begun, and this time, no faction is safe from the Erudite. The intellectual faction has started collecting all the Divergent, in an attempt to open a mysterious box, that supposedly contains something that will change all their lives forever. Tris and Four are on the other-side, doing everything they can to stop the group from hunting the Divergents, whom they see as the key to changing everything. The first part of this film is an excellent representation of the novel and is every bit as exhilarating, but the second part veers off into a new direction. The films producers said they wanted to make the story easier for the casual fan to understand, and they did that, unfortunately, taking away the complexity of the story, takes away some of it's magic. As for the ending, it is completely different from the novel, leaving many to wonder if they'll make the third book into a film at all. Indeed they plan to, but it's hard to see just how they will go about doing it, after the events put in place by the end of this film. Shailene Woodley and Theo James returned for the sequel and again, they played the characters to tee, I really felt like these two were meant to play Tris and Four before the book was even set to be released on the big screen. Once again, the special effects, the acting, and the story are amazing, and this film would be worthy of five stars, if not for the ending that diverted too far away from the original story.",

People change, their actions change, they leave out 80% of the book and replace another 30% with something completely different.

The problem in the main is that the earlier movie was more interesting as it was setting up the scenario. This one just becomes a kind of futuristic chase movie that is far too long. Plot points often lack clarity and whilst the film is eminently watchable the middle section drags noticeably. Shailene Woodley is a major asset as well as being a great little actress into the bargain. She out acts everyone else on screen even if Kate Winslet and Miles Teller have their moments. To get the most from proceedings it is advisable to have seen the earlier film if just for context. Naomi Watts is introduced here as a potential baddie but she doesn't really come into her own here. However, if the rather good ending is anything to go by, we can look forward to seeing a lot more of her next time when hopefully this film's failings are sorted out and improved upon. Finally, the special effects aren't bad, but there isn't really anything here that hasn't been seen before.",

Love, hate, struggle, judgement, corruption, manipulation and politics. All represented in this marvelous movie. The actors are perfect , no doubt about it, they give back the feeling of the society they live in and their characters's emotions are 100% presented. If you loved the first one, you will love this one too. I have a become a fan of this series.",
