The plot follows five married guys who invest in a loft so they can take their mistresses their and then one day they walk in and find a dead body and they must find out who did it. now none of these characters are necessarily likable but the performances behind them are pretty good. Karl Urban is great as per-usual, James Marsden is a stand out and gives the best performance in the entire movie, Matthias Schoenaerts is also very good reprising his role from the Belgium film, Eric Stonestreet is serviceable to his role but not really all that good and Wentworth Miller is just plain awful and awkward in his role. Rachel Taylor is quite surprisingly good as one of the mistresses and Isabel Lucas is really hot (she sheds a lot of skin and it is kind of awesome) and has definitely improved on her acting skills. While the film is very confusing and takes a little too many twists here and there, I did enjoy the unraveling and the motives, it kept me guessing until the end. My biggest issue with the movie is its ending it just felt a little too nice for how dark and serious the movie is. In the end I found this to be a very entertaining movie that I would go back and watch again because of its ensemble and its fun plot. I know it has a 0% on rotten tomatoes and everyone seems to be hating it but I really like and  I give \"The Loft\" an A-. It is now in my list of guilty movie pleasures and underappreciated movies.",

It\u2019s about 5 guys sharing a loft where they can bring their mistresses and eventually end up involved in an investigation that could land them all in jail. The movie has a very strong story that underlines the plot where it is going. This genre of erotic thriller is difficult in some parts of America. That is why the Belgian Director Erik Van Looy decided not to organize a press vision in advance. Perhaps he should just have done that given their pulverizing and ridicilous reviews. Apparently the American press has less difficulty with someone shooting forty men down than with five men who cheat!! The theme of premeditated adultery caused bad blood with the US press. That five adult males take a loft to jointly deceive their wives sometimes could shoot down the wrong way at the puritanical Americans, Van Looy had expected. But the press reviews are so over the top that they cannot be taken seriously because they prefer to pretend as if adultery does not exist. Just go look it up in theaters or bluray and decide for yourself!",

      "text": "\"The Loft got terrible reviews, it has a very rare 0% on Rotten Tomatoes so it interested me even more and i had to go watch it. So was it really that BAD?!? No it actually wasn't, at least for me. The acting is OK it's definitely not Oscar worthy and it's also not terrible. I thought Wentworth Miller was pretty decent, why people are calling him the worst actor in the movie is beyond me, if anything every actor was on par with each other. The film has so many plot twists and it gets annoying after a while, I could have done with one less twist. The way the story is told is in present tense as well as flashbacks between the present scenes and it's OK, but it could have been told better. There is some comedy relief mostly done by Eric Stonestreet also known as the fat guy from Modern Family. The movie had some potential but it kinda missed the mark, you wanna see how everything plays out but you also don't really care for any of the guys because they're all D-bags. Also I didn't buy that all 5 of them were friends. The movie would have been better had they added a thriller sense to it or just more suspense! I did enjoy it nonetheless, it did interest me and i honestly wasn't bored with it at all! Idk why critics tore this one apart, sometimes they just like doing that. If people can find enjoyment in movies like Tammy, Ouija and Transformers 4, why can't I somewhat enjoy this one ?! I'm giving The Loft a 6.5/10 it has its moments, but you're left thinking it could have been WAY better. Also I didn't like the ending. Is it worth watching at a theater? ehh, no not exactly. I don't regret it, but I also wouldn't say it's a must see at the theater lol. It's worth watching at least once, like a rental you'll either like it or not. I did like it but i know it had many flaws! I'll probably get it on bluray.\"\ufeff DON'T LISTEN TO CRITICS ON THIS ONE!",

You have talented actors so why are they in this film? It's the script that makes them terrible. We have two remakes that should not been made. The director of the original Erik Van Looy returns with more and more **** directing. The film gives us clues and good suspense the way we look at Karl Urban, James Marsden, Chris Vanowen, Wentworth Miller, Matthias Schoenaerts. The women in the film are terribly written; the film represents women as a whore of cliche's. But the film has a Hitchcock thriller and times it can be great it's gripping. Grade C+",
