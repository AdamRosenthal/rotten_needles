'Earth to Echo' was more of a snooze fest rather than a entertaining movie.",

The film aimed to highlight the importance of friendship and how this strong bond can sometimes be stretch to it's limits in tough circumstances. It defiantly got a lot of inspiration from Steven Spielberg with E.T. and Super 8 which made the film more engaging and familiar.

Yes the plot isn't original by a long shot, but it's still works in its own way. The story is somewhat unique and there are some entertaining (but also boring) moments. But it doesn't feel that exciting as what it could have been. It started a bit slow but it ascalated greatly in the second and the third act. The aspect that really stands out in Earth To Echo is the cinematography, it's unique but somewhat shaky and annoying. But is it worth watching -- I would say that's it's a 50 % chance that you would find it okay, so it's up to you. But I wouldn't take those odds.",

      "text": "Earth to Echo wanted to be a \"friendly-alien-lost-on-earth\" movie but I didn't do a very good job. The story was boring, the characters were not played well and in all it felt like a failed remake of E.T. The story-line was pretty much the same as E.T. anyway. At no point during the movie does it immerse you and give you a sense of feeling for the character of Echo in such a way as E.T did.",
