      "text": "\"Foxcatcher\" stars Steve Carell, Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo in this true story of the relationship between Olympic wrestling champions and brothers, Dave and Mark Schultz and a troubled and eccentric  member of the one of the wealthiest families in America, John DuPont. The film was written by E. Max Frye and Dan Futterman and was directed by Bennett Miller (\"Moneyball\") with Mr. Carell playing the part of John DuPont. Although Mr. DuPont\u2019s picture is not familiar to most of us, he obviously had a prominent nose which accounts for the significant and almost cartoon-like makeup which Mr. Carell wears throughout the film. Unfortunately, in the producers attempt to achieve reality, they brought about the opposite result as far as this viewer is concerned. No matter how much you want to lose yourself into the film and the character Mr. Carell attempts to portray, you (or I at least) are constantly reminded that it is Mr. Carell wearing lots of makeup. That being said, the film offers a study into the degrees of control those having the power to exert it will go in order to attain their goals. The film, though slow moving at times (2 hours and 14 minutes) manages to hold the viewer\u2019s interest as these two brothers cope with the idiosyncrasies and desires of their wealthy \"mentor\". I give the film an 8 but can\u2019t help wondering if a lesser known actor other than Mr. Carell could have been more convincing in the part he played.",

      "text": "Ultimately, Foxcatcher was a disappointment for me. After loving Bennett Miller's first two features, Capote and Moneyball, I had high hopes that with such interesting subject matter and a great cast, this one would be a home run. It, sadly, was not. However, it is still far from a bad film and instead above average. It is well-written and features some stellar acting from Steve Carell, Mark Ruffalo, and Channing Tatum. The mise en scene is also quite strong and the makeup is stellar. Carell's complete transformation into John Du Pont being the stand out when it comes to the makeup. Incredible work. The costume design is also quite good. However, this one is decidedly not a great film despite these positives because it is far too slow and really plodded along for much of the film. If it had half of the intensity featured in the trailer and was a touch shorter, it would have been a far better film, but as it stood, despite the creepy and odd atmosphere present in every scene, most scenes lacked the intensity needed. There is considerable tension found in most scenes, but they don't have much of an impact. Overall, Foxcatcher could have been far better, but as it stands, is a solid film that continues to show Bennett Miller as a great director who knows his way around biographical dramas.",

With 3 great actors playing fully fleshed out and three dimensional characters, impeccable direction, and a compelling true story, I'm sure it will go down in movie history.  Many movies that tell a true story simply go through the motions, relying on everyone's recognition of the events to do the heavy lifting, but not Foxcatcher.  Bennett Miller directs it with tension, detail and cinematic flourish.  Steve Carrel proves to be a more than solid dramatic actor.  He's creepy, strange, and yet somehow still garners sympathy.  I'm not sure what his performance would seem like without all that makeup, although I'm sure it would still be more than adequate.  Ruffalo and Tatum are also great, and maybe even better than Carrel, but he does stand out more due to his odd and sometimes villainous behavior.  I also have to give props to the writers for creating a script layered with psychological intricacies.  All in all, a great movie, a great story, and a great showcase for its actors.",

      "text": "\"Foxcatcher\" doesn't linger on some of the themes it touches upon long enough for them to register as strongly as they should. Nevertheless, this cautionary tale of the American dream, megalomania and  is a haunting and compelling drama in the vein of director Bennett Miller's earlier film \"Capote\" that is permeated by masterful nuance and a palpable sense of dread - largely by virtue of Miller's chilled direction that uses minimalist sets and moody hues to maximal efficacy and a triage of portrayals by riveting leads - Mark Ruffalo, Steve Carell and Channing Tatum, all of whom are unrecognisable in these immersive and mesmerising performances that are in perfect sync. Tatum is especially good, exerting mind, body and soul to convey frustration, emasculation and identity crisis in a desperately sad performance that simmers with tension - ironic considering his absence from the film's lethal climax. Carell, on the other hand, is far more restrained. Beneath the layers of prosthetics, his is a quietly complex portrait that invites pity more than repulsion from the viewer. The scenes he shares with Vanessa Redgrave as his mother are piercing and the chemistry he has with Ruffalo and Tatum reaches razor-sharp proportions of tension - with danger to match. And Mark Ruffalo, though arguably he has the least to do, ties the three of them together - as Tatum's gregarious, balanced older brother, he is a suitable foil to Carell's narcissism and Tatum's rage. When all three collide, the results are devastating and unforgettable viewing and a profound testament to the talent of all involved. If I am not falling over myself to watch \"Foxcatcher\" again, it is because I don't need to. It makes quite the impact the first time around.",

Carell may not win an Oscar for  this film but it did earn him his first nomination and its hard not to cheer for him as the Oscars approach. Mark Ruffalo also received an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Dave Schultz but its Channing Tatum who surprises me out of the whole cast. Tatum shows that he is certainly capable to of a serious role and he doesn't always have to be a big box office draw. I read Mark Schultz (who makes a cameo in the film if you know his story see if you can point him out) biography prior to watching the Foxcatcher movie and sure it does not necessarily follow the most true story but the film is still effective. The film was a lot darker and more thriller like than I had expected as I figured it would be more of an intense sport film. The ending of course is a pivotal part of the film and I will not give it away but if you are unaware of the Foxcatcher story it will likely shock you and I think that is why this film has gotten such critical acclaim because its a true story that many people are completely unaware of. If you're a fan of sports movie I would maybe sit this film out because it certainly not full of action but if you want to see some amazing acting Foxcatcher is a film for you.",

Carell isn't that good either (very bad make-up by the way). He's played a few other serious roles with much better results.  A ver slow, boring film, and it was about wrestling!",

Notice a lot of criticism that it was too slow, would have detracted from the story is it was rushed, if anything there should have been more in the movie about how du Pont came to resent Dave Schultz.",
