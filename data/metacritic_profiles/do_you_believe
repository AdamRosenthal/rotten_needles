In other words, a propaganda piece leveled at American Christians with hyperbolic straw man representations of their main enemies: atheists, academia, Muslims, and ethnic minorities. Much like last year's film, this one also is composed of several slightly interweaving stories that have no beginning, middle, end, hook, rising action, climax, denoument, tension, or entertainment value. Also like God's Not Dead, the protagonist, a white straight cis-gendered middle-class protestant male overcomes imaginary obstacles to strengthen his faith in white Jesus.",

The anthology plot devices are difficult for any director to pull off, but the film held together pretty well, and many of the sequences were quite moving. Yes, Do You Believe? is targeted at the faith community, but you have to wonder -- with so many people who claim that their faith is the most important part of their lives, why are there so few films that put things such as prayer up on the screen? Definitely a step up from the films starring Kirk Cameron. Pure Flix is on its way to crafting solid cinema. The film is worth supporting in theaters.",
