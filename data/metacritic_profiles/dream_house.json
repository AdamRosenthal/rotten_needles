It is difficult to say too much about the film without spoilers which I will try to avoid.  It is an entertaining if slow film which starts well, blindsides you quite early on and then ends predictably.  The main performances are excellent, and it is also well shot with some nice scenes.  This makes for an engaging and intriguing film in many ways but it is just unfortunate that the story is not strong enough and the whole ends up less than the sum of its parts. A good (if not necessarily original) idea which maybe required a bit more work to make a really good film.",

      "text": "It is such a shame that Daniel Craig, Rachel Weisz and Director Jim Sheridan didn't have final say on what the movie was going to look like in theaters. The plot itself is a very intriguing one, and if the trailer had been cut right, it would have been an intense movie with a great twist. Unfortunately viewers got more than a taste of what the movie would be before they stepped foot in the theater because of the spoiler trailer. Instead of the excitement I had in movies like Shutter Island or Identity, I was stuck wondering how this would get resolved or why I would care. Fortunately Craig did a great job and his real life and on screen wife had a great rapport with him that really kept me interested. Sadly it wasn't enough to make up for the terrible \"twist\" you didn't know about beforehand and the dreadful parts of Naomi Watts and the two villains. Definitely a pass.",

When these two terms blend together you should have a flawless screenplay for an awesome Hollywood thriller. Sadly \"Dream House\" is not it.

When the twist comes along (half way through) it is a bit of a shock but is fairly uninspiring.  Waiting for the plot to uncurl further and introduce what part the caring neighbor plays also keeps the viewer guessing, unfortunately the movie ends unimaginatively and will disappoint most.",

      "text": "Dream House is a hard movie to review  or even describe  without revealing too many twists and turns of the plot. The film stars Daniel Craig (Girl With The Dragon Tattoo) as a writer who settles into a quaint home with his wife (Rachel Weisz) and two daughters, only to learn that their house was the scene of a horrific crime. When strange things start going bump in the night, the husband starts to uncover a connection to the tragic murders  but only the pretty neighbor (Naomi Watts) seems to know what\u2019s going on for sure. Dream House was directed by Jim Sheridan, the man behind such great films as My Left Foot and The Boxer, as well as so-so films like Brothers and Get Rich or Die Trying. Sheridan is a skilled director (even when he\u2019s working with half-baked material) so technically speaking, Dream House is visually sound and richly textured in its disparity between the warm hues and glows of a family home, full of love, and the harsh, blue-tinted, snow-ridden world outside that home  or, at times, the grit and grime of homes that have been overrun with rot and despair. The other strength of the film is its cast. Craig, Weisz and Watts are all skilled actors and keep a lot of the more ridiculous aspects of the story (more on that later) grounded in believable performances. Craig  often stone-faced and grim  displays some warmth and smiles in his role as a loving father, though he gets ample time to stone-face it as well. Weisz is good as a free-spirited wife and mother; she makes her character stand out as a unique and fully-formed person, while Watts is given a harder task, playing a pivotal character that has to be balanced just right to be believable at all. Watts almost pulls of that balancing act, but not quite. Guys like Elias Koteas and Marton Csokas are great character actors  though they\u2019re given little to work with here. This is also a film that changes gears very drastically in its 1st, 2nd, and 3rd acts, and subsequently feels disjointed and episodic, rather than organic and cohesive. There are also a truckload of logical flaws, and plot holes so wide they are nearly impossible not to fall into. On the whole, the poor script reduces Dream House to a movie that is hard to get into  and stay into  despite the talented actors and director working to keep it grounded and engaging. Sometimes an idea just falls flat. There\u2019s no harm in the trying. Certain viewers may watch Dream House and be thrilled by the shifting, uncertain nature of its plot (if they can avoid scrutinizing it and simply brush off the gaping holes). As stated, the film is well-constructed and well-acted, so it\u2019s not a total nightmare. However, like the strangest of dreams, watching this movie will  leave you feeling muddled and somewhat upset about the experience.",
