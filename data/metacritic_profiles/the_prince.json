      "text": "Paul (Jason Patric) is a mafia hit-man in New Orleans, and with a baby on the way, he wants out. Paul thinks the only way to do that is to kill his boss (Bruce Willis). With a car bomb in place, Paul waits for his boss to leave for the day, but is shocked to see the bosses wife and daughter get into the car instead. After the tragedy, Paul and his family flea and for 18 years, live in peace, but that all changes when his daughter goes down to New Orleans for a weekend getaway and disappears. The dry, emotionless, Jason Patric stars in this film and as it turns out, he's perfect for the role. As The Prince, the heir apparent, Patric has to play both a loving father and a ruthless criminal and does so admirably. While he's listed in the background, he really is the star of the movie, with the other big names making sporadic appearances. It's a shame, because Bruce Willis's boss character seemed to be a really interesting guy, who I'd have loved to see more of and learn more about. The Prince isn't very unique and you can't help but draw parallels to A History of Violence. While not as good, the film still features some intense action and a great story. The one draw back is that the Prince is so focused on this man Paul, and his goals, that they ignore some very compelling side stories. Had I been the writer, I would have utilized flashbacks through out, to show more of the prince and the bosses story, but sadly they didn't. Aside from that I really enjoyed the film, it was a chase, a mystery, and a mafia film rolled into one, with some great cameos, and an unexpected ending. This is the kind of action film I'd love to see more of. It isn't simply about the special effects and the guns, there is a purpose behind all of it, and that makes all the difference.",

This movie has nothing good to talk about, fact is, it has nothing okay to talk about. The Prince is a ripoff of Taken, and boy it disappoints. The story, well, what was it? Like, Vice, Brian Miller forgets about everything and focuses on the oddly violent action sequences, with the most horrible green screen, you will see in a movie. It's not even a movie, it's a practical joke, played by Miller, on Bruce Willis, who gets framed in this bad thriller with a pay check that is not as deserving. Same goes for Joan Cusack, who makes movies for the extra dollar now, ex. The Bag Man, which had Robert De Niro, who ALSO makes low budget monstrosities like Killing Season. The chain reaction goes on and on and I fear that maybe, actors like Tommy Lee Jones or Tom Cruise might fall under the same demise to earn some bucks. I hope, you haven't watched this movie, it's trailer or even got free tickets to it. It's a shame to Hollywood. Nuff Said.",

Since 2010, he mainly directed straight-to-DVD titles that struggle to reach a mere 5 out of 10 on their Imdb page: action flicks with a half-baked plot and risible acting, often featuring fallen-from-grace stars and shoddy special effects - arguably the equivalent of old style B-movies. Nothing suggests that they will ever gain the same cult-like following as the films that inspired Quentin Tarantino; most of the time, they take themselves way too seriously to be enjoyable trash culture, and end up becoming sheer nothingness, forgotten in the discounted DVD basket at the supermarket. The Prince, however, features the likes of Jason Patric (you might \u2013 or might not \u2013 remember him from Speed 2), John Cusack and Bruce Willis. It could have been a turning point in Miller\u2019s career; instead, as expected, it\u2019s just another unsuccessful attempt.",
