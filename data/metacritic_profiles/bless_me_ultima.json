Slow paced and dialogue driven, spiritual, and completely watchable.  The success of the entire movie depends on child actor Luke Ganalon, and he does an excellent job in the title role.  One day an elderly medicine woman (a \"Curandera\") arrives at young Antonio's home to spend the final days of her life, and there is an instant bond between the two.  She teaches him the ways of her healing and magic, and the special relationship Man shares with the earth.  Curanderas are both revered and feared in their culture, and she is seen as an evil witch by some.  The only problem I had with the movie is that it is narrated by the older Antonio in parts, and it is never explained who he has become as an adult.  Still, a well done film.",

Not only that, the diverged story with often the plot that meets fantasy and reality at a certain quantity was told in a great quality.
