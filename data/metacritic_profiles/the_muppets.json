We just went last night, and I already want to see it again.  I will definitely be purchasing the DVD.  The plot is fairly similar to the first Muppet Movie, but I found that to be a good thing, because it was as if it was paying homage to it.  The new songs are pretty corny, but fun and enjoyable (and will get stuck in your head), and it was really nice that songs from the Muppet Show were used.  I would highly recommend going to see this movie...especially if you've ever been a muppet fan.",

With the real world reflects just like the story in thiz movie, since the very first stage of movie-making process, thiz movie was way underrated. People keep asking, did thiz movie will actually work? Anyway, look how well the movie is doing now. The Stars sparkle all over the place. The famous frog Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear, Gonzo, Scooter, Animal and other members of The Muppets, can bring the hilarious atmosphere instantly, including the new introduced character, Walter. Jason Segel proves out to be surprisingly talented with his energetic singing and dancing. ENCHANTED (2007) princess Amy Adams is a brilliant choice for her role, she is an unarguable Disney princess figure in human form. The bad guy looks cynical and funny at the same time, played very very well by Chris Cooper. Not to mention, it is featuring endless Celebrity Guests such as Jack Black, Emily Blunt, Zach Galifianakis, Whoopi Goldberg, Selena Gomez, Ken Jeong, Sarah Silverman, Neil Patrick Harris, John Krasinski and even Dave Grohl from FOO FIGHTERS. James Bobin made his directorial debut through thiz movie. The songs are part of thiz musical extravaganza. The singles like LIFE A HAPPY SONG, ME PARTY or MAN OR MUPPET are one of the best moments. The ending scene is effective (Spoiler Alert!). When is told that they have finally got the appreciation and applause from millions of people outside the studio. It is simply to say, we could have happy tears along. It is not just about the Muppets anymore. But it is also about every one of us who have grown up with these guys. Whether we realize it or not, in that very moment, we had a sort of feeling, it was like we looked back the years we had been through and we suddenly realized how much we had already changed. The innocent world that we once had is exist. The Creator Jim Henson must be proud of what they have done. Thanks, guys. Thanks for bringing us the third greatest gift of all, which is the laughter! When they do, they have got the whole wide world in the palm of their hand.",

Not only was Jason Segal and Amy Adams amazing additions to the gang but Walter (the cute 3-foot tall brown haired die hard muppet fan) was also a charming little muppet that was added to the gang. But as always, Kermit, Animal, Fozzie, and the rest of the gang really played a big part in the making of the joyful feeling that only the muppets can give. Awesome storyline also gave this movie its delightful mood. The way it fits it's awesome guest stars including Jack Black, Whoopi Goldberg, and Zach Galifianakis. The way it fits all the gut busting jokes that adults can even laugh too, and hard. Sweet musical numbers and even a little drama make this movie great.

To me he's the guy who wants to do a performance justice, but lacks the right type of talent (TV actor instead of Blockbuster actor) and in the process overdoes his part and kinda ruins it. While I enjoyed the movie more the second time, I found the overbearing performance of Jason Segel paired with the terrible quick fix for the hole they left in the plot was still too much to improve my score. (the quick fix is in the credits, and was ridiculously cheap... almost renders the whole effort of the movie null). Still worth the price of admission for any level of Muppets fan.",

Now, I've read some of the other user comments saying that this movie was perfect for those who grew up with the Muppets, and perhaps that's were the positive reviews come from. From the eyes of a 13-yr-old, though, this movie was incredible boring. My 11-yr-old sister and my mother (she's 39 forever) watched the movie as well agree with this view, so I doubt it's the age difference that made this movie much a catastrophe for me.

While that approach works in movies like Muppet Treasure Island, this movie is an attempt to pander to fans of the old Muppet TV show, and therefore renders the human plot unnecessary.  The Muppet humor is done quite well, and I expect fans of the show or the movies will be pleased with it, however there isn't nearly enough of it and it takes about twenty minutes of the film to even get to the first real bit of it.  The new Muppet, Walter, is pretty pathetic (he looks like a Sesame Street reject, and acts about the same), and the movie's \"villain\" is even worse (he raps, and he's bad at it). The overall plot is extremely predictable, and the human actors seem like they're just reading lines. Final verdict:  There are 50 minutes of good old fashioned Muppet laughs here, but you have to get through 50 minutes of mediocre (at best) filmmaking to get to the good stuff.",

      "text": "Nothing says \"keep out\" quite like an electric fence. The visitors, however, aren't deterred, not even after Walter gets fried trying to scale the high voltage security system, which protects the faded green star from his public. Kermit has become a recluse, living alone in a Shangri La-like mansion, bitter over being surpassed by the far-edgier Avenue Q puppets(disguised as The Moopets, here). 80's Robot, a sort of manservant(shades of Sunset Boulevard), is his Rosebud. It's not 1979 anymore. In The Muppet Movie, the narrative culminates with the burgeoning theatrical players stepping into the lair of Worldwide Studio head Lew Lord. The very familiar man behind the desk appraises them, then over the intercom, tells his secretary to prepare a contract, which allows the frog to direct the Muppets' origin story. Sitting alone on his director's chair in an empty soundstage, it's hard not to imagine Kermit as a stand-in for Orson Welles, on the verge of directing his own Citizen Kane, a first film without any studio interference. Ironically, in The Muppets, Kermit has turned into Charles Foster Kane. He's Citizen Frog, an exorbitantly wealthy amphibian who lost his empire...and pig. Without Kermit no longer acting as her impresario, Miss Piggy, no doubt, found out the truth about her singing, just like Kane's second wife, the failed opera singer. Like Mrs. Kane, the pig realized that her popularity was rigged, due to the undue influence of a powerful alpha male. But whereas, the opera singer ends up on skid row, eking out a living as a club owner, Miss Piggy thrives, serving as the editor of French Vogue. The pig wears Prada. Still harboring a grudge over the frog breaking off their wedding engagement, Kermit leaves France without his muse. \"You never intended to marry me,\" the pig complains, and frustratingly, due to the thematic parameters of a children's movie, Kermit's misgivings about the woman whose likeness adorns his entrance gate, is never brought to light. Past films offer clues, though. In \"The Muppets Take Manhattan\", the beautiful swine expresses her jealousy over the frog's friendship with a NYC waitress, whom the pig misinterprets as a love interest. As it so happens, Juliana has fashion designing aspirations. Miss Piggy's meteoric rise in the haute coutre industry could be a response to her paranoia about an interspecies relationship, more kinkier than their own. Unlike past Muppet projects, the subject of sex emerges from the subtext. Surely, the frog and the pig, and for that matter, Gonzo and his harem of chickens(Camilla is a swinger), got it on, but there was never any evidence of animal lust, no godforsaken byproduct of cross-breeding. But in The Muppets, there is verifiable proof that sex occurred between a puppet and a human. Walter isn't Gary's imaginary friend, but an actual flesh and blood brother, so to speak. In a montage, an off-screen adult, a human one, presumably the mother, measures both boys against the side of a doorway, where Gary sets new highs in verticality throughout their shared childhood, while Walter remains forever short, victimized by a form of dwarfism. The father, the probable muppet and absentee dad, isn't around to help his son feel normal. Lucky for Walter, the human brother does what he can to assimilate the felt one, but to some degree, as suggested by the post-modern diegesis, the film, therefore the subject, approaches his \"skin\" as an egregious malady, a disease. At the carnival, the movie references Rocky Dennis from \"Mask\", in the scene where Walter sees himself as a tall person in the same sort of funhouse mirror that the deformed boy, afflicted with a cranial enlargement disorder called lionitis, realizes his dream of normalcy through the same reflection trick. Walter's reaction to The Muppet Show is telling; it's the first time he lays eyes on his own kind, way back when Kermit could lay claim to being a comedy king. Now the frog is a has-been, or worse, a never-was, thanks to a history-challenged modern audience, too young to remember the puppet troupe's heyday. Their nearly non-existent cultural currency entails that they abduct a celebrity(Jack Black) to host a comeback show, bringing to mind, for some, Martin Scorsese's The King of Comedy, in which Rupert Pupkin kidnaps a Johnny Carson-type named Jerry Langford. The broadcast just happens to be a telethon, the genre that links The Muppets to the 1983 film, since Langford is played by Jerry Lewis, the host of so many MDA shows. In The King of Comedy, Rupert has a hard time distinguishing fantasy from reality, the same dilemma bedeviling Kermit, who believes that they're close to reaching the ten million dollar plateau, when in actuality, the tote board reads something far short. The people in the audience: Are they real? After all, the show starts with an empty studio. And what about the mob outside? Does this all play in Kermit's head?",

I supposed you could say that due to the limits of puppetry, but I say they could have done a better job. The musical numbers also have some problems, mostly considering that there's no real point to them. The numbers are short, don't feature great singing, and the dances are pretty simplistic. Of course this is no \"Singin' in the Rain\" or \"Sound of Music\", but it still pains me to see such weak musical efforts in a movie that could've benefited from them.

Also, you can tell that it has been influenced by 'Flight of the Concords' too, another show I am a fan of. This is a result of it being directed by James Bobin, 'Flight of the Conchords' co-founder and its music director Bret McKenzie from Flight of the Concords. So if you are a fan of the Muppets or Flight of the Conchords I recommend seeing this. Even if you are not but you want to see a nice light heart-warming comedy with singing puppets, you should still enjoy this.",

I still watch them all the time owning a couple of them on blu ray and dvd i watch The Muppet Christmas Carol every year on Christmas. Some people may not like Jason Segel saying he is an annoying actor but i would have to disagree with them. I like the guy he is really talented and the effort he put into making this film shows that. Amy Adams is a doll so its always a treat when she is in a movie. All the cameos in the movie were awesome and it was fun spotting them its too bad they couldnt get all the actors they wanted becuase of timing i really would have loved to see Jon Favreau, Ben Stiller, Steve Carell, George Clooney, Mel Brooks, Mila Kunis, Ed Helms, Alan Arkin, and Dave Grohl. It was funny watching Forgetting Sarah Marshall back in 2008 seeing Segel do a Puppet musical it was a teaser of what was to come.",
