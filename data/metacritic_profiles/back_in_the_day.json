He not only wrote and directed this movie but he also starred in it! He did a great job.  It was made with lots of heart and soul.  It has a great cast that will make you laugh. There is some nudity in it but it's not too much. Just enough for some laughs. If you get the DVD you should also check out the extras! that is the best part of the movie! I highly suggest the world check this awesome movie out! You won't regret it!",
