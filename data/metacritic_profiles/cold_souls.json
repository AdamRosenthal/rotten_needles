It is no wonder that this film has influenced other works in cinema.  However, although most movies are not too original, Sophie Barthes's debut film resembles Kaufman's work way too closely to Eternal Sunshine and Being John Malcovich, which was also crafted by Kaufman.",

      "text": "A very strange and clever comedy starring Paul Giamatti as a semi-biographical version of himself.  The soul-swapping premise is perfect for a 90 minute run time... unfortunately this runs at least 10 minutes longer than that.  Subsequently, it gets a little draggy and derivative at times but the overall film is quite good.  Another fine Giamatti performance to add to the long list of fine Giamatti performances!",

The same company also works with a Soul Black Market in Russia, with a mule scheme (and in this points enter Nina the other protagonist), from this point the story of the movie unrolls... it's a well acted movie, with a unusual and interesting theme. My score: 6,7 / 10,0.",
