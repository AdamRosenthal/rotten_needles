Sarandon and Keaton and  De Niro have beautiful adorable chemistry, and even know this isn't Heigl's best film, she does do a great job portraying  as this mean spirited character, but it's the best character I've seen her play. Don (played by Robert De Niro) and Ellie Griffin (Diane Keaton) are divorced, but  their adopted Alejandro's (Ben Barnes) biological mother unexpectedly decides to come to wedding, she believes that divorce is a big fat sin, so Don and Ellie are forced to be a married couple. They also have to confront their past, present and future. And avoid killing each other through the process. The chemistry between Barnes and Seyfried is cute; this could of have been terribly made but Zackham makes it charming and witty, also makes it stunning. Grade B+",
