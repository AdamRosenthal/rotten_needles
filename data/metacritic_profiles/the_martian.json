It seems North American culture has been seriously dumbed-down, now lacking any measure of critical thought. This film was mediocre at best. Yes, the Mars landscape was nicely done; but visual effects alone don't make a decent movie - the effects of Gravity were much better, in my opinion. A  good film requires a good story, plot, dialogue, suspense, acting, etc. The Martian was so predictable it was boring. Damon's acting was adequate but forgetable. I felt nothing for any of the characters, and couldn't care what happened to them as the film ignored any potential psychological and emotional aspects of the story. Most of the characters acted like frat boys, not like professionals you'd expect in these roles. Damon's \"kiss my ass Neil Armstrong\" and other painful and foul-mouthed quips seem to appeal to a \"now generation\" too wrapped up in themselves to respect and honor past achievements - a professional astronaut certainly wouldn't act like that. And the disco music score was odd, jarring, like a drunk uncle karaoke-ing at a wedding. If this film was meant to be drama/comedy/sci-fi it fell flat on all accounts, appealing to the lowest common denominator. In my opinion, this is typical Hollywood capitalist crap, enabled by a well-bribed mass media, out to rip off people for profit (why can't I get a refund?), completely lacking in substance, made for dumb people who haven't picked up a book in their lives. And the positive reviews on here and elsewhere reveal a serious decline in taste. Has everyone become pigs satisfied with slop?",

I mean, what the mmph were they all doing out there at the beginning of the film getting the Matt Damon character almost killed? That was just too stupid right outta the gate -- I mean, the storm is so ferocious that they have to abort everything and lift off, yet there they are outside the ship traipsing about doing something God-knows-what. Derrr. Sorry, but this stuff just drives me crazy.",

While it seems to be a rescue mission, the film is able to deliver an important message - regardless the help from the whole world, self-initiation determines the survival opportunity.

There is only one genuine scientific error in the story, and it was committed knowingly and deliberately as a plot device to strand astronaut Mark Watney: the atmospheric pressure on Mars is so low that the fiercest sandstorms could barely flutter a flag, let alone do the damage portrayed in the opening sequence. The only other quibbles involve things that we know more about today (thanks to NASA orbiters and rovers) than we did when Weir started writing: Mars does have tiny amount of liquid water at places on its surface, but it's hypersaline and undoubtedly full of toxic perchlorates; the dirt Watney wallows in would probably also have enough perchlorate in it to poison him; putting your intestinal bacteria into Martian soil, on Mars, is a major no-no according to international treaties about planetary protection: we still don't know whether Mars has any bacteria of its own, and we don't want to confuse the issue by contaminating the place with E. coli. Also, although the terrain at the novel's landing site looks smooth in maps made from orbit, in high-res view it turns out to be covered with huge potholes that would make driving vehicles difficult. And finally, the orbital maneuvers at the end of the novel, involving releasing air and flying \"like Iron Man\" are more comic book than physics book.  But those are \"errors\" only uber-nerds would cite. The novel is as hard as science fiction ever gets. The most improbable idea in it is that the US Congress would ever fund NASA enough to do these things, but NASA probably could do them were it given the funds.",

On the other hand Matt Damon thinks of his situation like a huge video game in that he has to be smarter than the average bear.  At no time does the audience not think that he isn't getting back home.  There is no suspense; no sense of urgency; no sense of danger; and that is what takes the movie down.  If you saw Sandra Bullock in the yawn of a movie Gravity where she talks to herself, the The Martian is the same, but this time with Matt Damon in a comedic role which belies all realty.

Also, the ending was slightly tweaked and added on to, but other than that, the rest of the film was entertaining, Damon gave a confident and often times humorous performance (staying true to the nature of his character in the book), and Scott's direction was superb and a great return to form after some of his previous mediocre films (e.g., The Counselor, Exodus.)

I don't think it's as good as the rapturous, and profound Interstellar, but it is one of the best and most enjoyable movies of the year and will go down as another Ridley Scott sci-fi classic.",

The film pays serious attention to detail in matters such as food and water supply for The Martian yet depends on an increasingly improbable series of mishaps and 'heroic' acts to move the plot along. Surprisingly corny dialogue, lame soundtrack, forgettable acting by the supporting cast and a succession of action-adventure cliches (including that old stand-by: the kitchen-made bomb for blowing the hatch) confirms Scott's fading reputation in this genre.

It's too busy focussing on space science and rarely on human struggle or emotion beyond humour. All great stories are dark in some way, The Martian takes avenues in the storytelling that is uninteresting and predictable. Not a single character is linked or emotionally attached to Matt Damon. So how can I care for anyone else? It's not what was on the screen that disappointed me, it's what wasn't there. I'm very unclear as to why this movie is highly raved. It is suspiciously overrated. At least create a dilemma like what if Matt Damon was left on mars on purpose. Ridley Scott created an overlong overdone movie with a massive budget, a big paycheck and no memorable payoff.

However, independent of the specified context, 'The Martian' is a spectacular exploration of the admittedly generic but nevertheless magical realm of human perseverance, determination, impartial compassion as well as the fight to exist. Gripping, suspenseful and often surprisingly comical, its character study of Mark Watney is a subterfuge to inspire us, and tell the uplifting story of the will of the human spirit in the face of extreme adversity. The film is oddly light-hearted (for a film that had a person deserted on a planet for years), however, this made for a kind of hunger for a greater range of emotion from our protagonist; one could argue that the uniqueness of the protagonist lies in his ability to withstand the harshest of conditions - yet, this makes for an overall less powerful tale of how bad the conditions really were - how bad things were before they got better. The cinematography of the film often paved the way for many beautiful scenes, but it is trivially easy to take a beautiful shot of outer space, or a planet. The difficult parts of the job lie with mise en scene - the shadows, the frame composition, and the colour palette of the frame. There were few shots that stood out in any of those criteria. In this sense, The Martian lacked a distinct style of its own, which Ridley Scott is often so apt at (refer to 1979's 'Alien'). Furthermore, lightheartedness took the place of gripping, gritty atmosphere, which makes for a less tonally diverse film. The soundtrack is often melodically repetitive and generic, but generally ticks the boxes.",

The movie stars Matt Damon as Mark Watney, a NASA astronaut who gets left behind on Mars and has to survive with limited resources available until help arrives. Damon\u2019s portrayal of the character is stellar! His comic timing and his acting is spot on. The way his character keeps himself positive even during overwhelming odds in which the average Joe would probably lose all hope of survival (on a planet where nothing grows, which Watney himself admits) is extremely enamoring. There is a genuine concern that you feel for the character\u2019s plight. And whenever he achieves something like, being able to establish contact with Earth or grow food, you want to rejoice with him.",

Despite this more intellectual approach, Damon's performance is spirited, amusing and occasionally touching. Director Ridley Scott manages to make the moving parts and technical explanations acceptable, while mining a bit of emotion and even humor in the interactions.

I thought it dragged a little bit too long. \"Gravity\" didn't have that problem, and to be honest, I found the latter to be more entertaining. I know some people say it's vastly overrated, but I frankly don't think that way. The visuals in that movie were a little better than this one, but \"The Martian\" is still pretty to look at. Matt Damon is amazing and shows a tremendous devotion to his character. What I like about the character is how he used humor to get him out of a sticky situation. It doesn't feel forced or anything. I wish I could say the same thing to the other characters though. Sometimes the movie would fall into movie conversations that last longer than they should have, and that attempt to make you invested. Science fiction is clearly not my cup of tea, but I can appreciate it when the film deserves it. Other nitpicking element I'd like to bring up is the \"not so subtle foreshadowing\". There was this scene where the NASA president says Damon's character has chances of survival... this of course if something doesn't go horribly wrong, and in the very next scene, what happens? Surprise, surprise, the airlock decompresses and Mark gets himself blown up!",

This movie is so diverse that Science-Fiction fans will love it, drama fans will love it and just the movie fan in general will love it. The music used in the movie which takes up a great portion of the original soundtrack is from the 80 's; songs like Waterloo from ABBA or Rock the boat from the Hues Corporation really set the tone for this movie. The movie's atmosphere was just so great you just want this movie over and over again. And that brings me to my only little flaw with the movie (this really not a big thing). Which is that the movie's re-watch ability is not that high because the movie is over two hours and it also really feels like a long movie. So when you've already watched this movie you're just going to wait for the parts of the movie you really liked the first time you watched it. The rest of the movie is just a bit boring then, because it's a bit repetitive a times too. Which obviously is due to the slow phasing (which is not a bad thing) and the same environments the movie takes place in",

Each movie has their own distinct style and can be enjoyed for different reasons. Of the four, The Martian is probably the most light-hearted and fun to watch, but don't let my words fool you. There are some insanely intense scenes to be found here. Based on the novel of the same name, The Martian is about astronaut Mark Watney who is presumed dead after a violent storm and left behind by the crew. He actually lives and must survive on Mars for months with meager supplies and his own ingenuity. Ridley Scott directed this film, and he was desperately in need of a success after the financial and commercial disappointments of Exodus: Gods and Kings and The Counsler. Luckily, he delivers one of his most spectacular movies to date that's capable of making you laugh and putting you on the edge of your seat. The final act of the film is particularly nail-biting, drawing comparisons to some of Gravity's most terrifying scenes. But what makes The Martian such a hit is its heart. Besides its great humor and amazing characters, it emphasizes the value and integrity of the human spirit. It may not go into the more philosophical implications of those themes too much, but when a movie is this well crafted, that hardly matters. The Martian is up there with the other great sci-fi epics of recent years, and it's certainly one of the best films of the year.",

There are a few too many comedic moments that rob the dramatic weight from key scenes, particularly at the climax. Watney's joking tone plays well when it's cast as a coping mechanism for the vast problems that he faces, but it takes us out of the moment when he's cracking jokes while others are risking their lives to try and save him.

Lead Character \"Mark Watney\" played by Matt Damon is a treat to watch. Mark is a Astronaut who's indeed a Botanist and Chemist totally we can call Scientist. His hardships on the planet Mars makes the movie a horrific thriller with essence of his comedy timing. Mainly in 3D one can really feel the presence of Mars just at a distance of his eyesight. This credit goes to the Cinematography and VFX department who has really done a wonderful job. The Martian is a great attempt from Ridley Scott after Oscar winning Gladiator. The only confusing element in the movie is 'Time', where one can feel some logics are missing but the humorous part in the movie is Mark got survived on the Mars only by potatoes.

The film really handled the jokes very well, and at times could of extended to a R-Rated movie. Also, I really enjoyed the first half of the movie. But that was about it... The last part really seemed to drag until its final act, and it really disappointed me during the last half excluding the ending. The ending was great though, and I felt like if the movie had just ended at 1 hr. 31 min. like Gravity did, it would have been a lot better. However considering that, this film was much better than Interstellar, and you might like it or not. It really depends on your tolerance for really long space movies. Also, I was surprised by the amount of people in my theater:",

The characters had the potential to be so much deeper (as they are in the book) and the limited time to tell this story left even the main protagonist, Mark Watney, with what seemed like an untold story. Nobody does it anymore but this would have been perfect for a 3 or 4 part miniseries on TV as the flushing out of the characters and their struggles could have been so much more profound. That said the movie stuck very close to the book for the most part and I love the use of real science behind everything.

Seriously, if you have seen a lot of movies in your life you will have a lot of De-ja Vu while watching this film.  The Apollo 13 film had the exact same plot, someone stuck in space and we have to get them home, so there is constant interplay between the Astronaut and NASA on how they are going to fix the problems that constantly come up.  That doesn't mean I didn't like The Martian.  If you have Ridley Scott directing and Matt Damon starring chances are it's going to be well made.  I really loved the look of the film, and it did keep me interested for the entire 2 1/2 hours.  It's just not a film I would have a deep desire to see again.",

Emotional, heartfelt and most of all, a love letter to science and human ingenuity, it is also a great space thriller. As if apologizing for Prometheus, which contains scientists doing some really dumb things, the astronauts in The Martian are cool folks, solving problems left and right. At its heart though is Matt Damon's incredible performance, an Oscar worthy one where you believe that despite incredible odds, his optimistic astronaut will survive. As per usual, The Martian is a gorgeous film, and along with Gravity and Interstellar, somehow made them an 'unofficial' trilogy of absolutely great hard sci-fi films that need to be seen on the Big Screen. Is it one of the best film of 2015? For sure.",

So basically Ridley Scott ruined this story, the screenplay is not very clever, the music is simple and the acting of Matt Damon is awful, he is incapable of involving the audience with what is like to be trapped in outer space, and he is basically the pillar supporting the whole thing, which transforms all the effort of the author in a lame space movie among many, that will soon be forgotten.",

Lets face it, the plot was boring and we should have been yawning through the whole movie but somehow... I kept watching scene after scene without falling asleep. The directing and writing was very good and Matt Damon played his role well enough. But ultimately nothing could save this movie from being another unoriginal survival story with yet another Hollywood portrayal of scientists as being borderline idiots. I mean... another gravity slingshot solution? Really? This is semester 1 physics level problem for Petes sake and has been done dozens of times in TV shows and movies. But what was enjoyable was the dialog between Matt and NASA and watching how one would survive on another planet should it ever happen. Maybe I was so interested in the science of colonizing another planet that it kept me up through the movie. I am not sure honestly but this is no masterpiece and the reveiws are clearly bloated. At best, this is an average flick.",

The movie was simply a two dimensional wise crack that would be most suitable for high school students or the developing world.  I was bored after about 15 minutes when i knew exactly how it would end though perhaps not the exact incredibly miraculous method to save out protagonist.  The movie really reminds me of the show, Dirtiest Job, which is about the highest degree of mental and emotional level your are placed in with this thing.  It was simply built around matt damon so he could play the incredible, smart and lucky hero who kept the dumb folks in the audience guffawing with lame stereotype jokes, it was a waste of money but a huge waste of precious time.

The only downfall is a few scenes that stretch reality and goofs such as unrealistic gravitation. Those are clearly not issues warranting complaint, but to give you an idea those are the strongest flaws in the film. The story is incredibly inspirational and every performance does the job. Overall it's an incredibly entertaining survival story, but the strongest aspect is surprisingly the large amount of comedy that will surely keep you smiling all the while rooting for the story. It's a must-see film and a sure frontrunner for best picture of 2015.",

But, Matt Damon's portrayal of main character Mark Watney was well deserved of the Oscar Nomination, and makes up for the underused characters. Harry Gregson-Williams' score fit the film exactly, and his use of electronic themes and classical strings made the score even more remarkable.

I could have watched the first half hour, skipped to the end and missed nothing. This is not a criticism of of the actors, directors or crew. They made a beautiful movie.

I was waiting for something to happen, but it was going round and round in Astrodynamics curves which need to be met, applauding audiences on earth, heartbreaking crew members and families, and the Martian itself performing miracle after miracle. Characters have annoying habit of express and ultrafast dialogue responses of  geniuses, like in a lot of movies today. So i gave up. The Botanist part of the movie was even good, but after that nothing. It's not about solitude itself, ''Castaway'' for example is much better movie. Maybe it needs some time for the overrated scores to deflate to something around 45%, or 5 out of 10, which is closer to reality.",
