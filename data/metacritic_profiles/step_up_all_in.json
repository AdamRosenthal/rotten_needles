The movie boasts a dynamic choreography and stellar music to go with it, some are timed just right and they are admittedly entertaining. It commendably tries to bring a dancer's perspective on their life style and tribulation, but the plot often contradicts the effort by putting overly flamboyant characters or tired plot. In the end it's just another drawn out excuse for a dance battle, albeit a rather spectacular one.",
