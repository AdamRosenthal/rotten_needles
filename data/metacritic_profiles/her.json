So many stories these days highlight some element of technological advancement, but they're usually developed in such a pedestrian way. I'm so glad Jonze put his unique stamp on this picture.  Phoenix delivers the goods, as you would expect, but the supporting turns by Amy Adams, Olivia Wilde, Portia Doubleday, Rooney Mara, and, of course, Scarlett Johansson are phenomenal. Further, the future Los Angeles setting is so delicately crafted, right down to the subtle fashion trends, but these elements are never distracting.  An easy recommendation.",

Phoenix and Johansson are incredible.  Chris Pratt is hilarious as always, and the vision of a future Los Angeles is seamless (save for the stunning cleanliness and lack of diversity, though admittedly this is a look at one man's story and life in the future, not the whole of a city, which is expansive and massive with glass towers sprouting up everywhere).

She assumed that i wanted to see \"Lone Survivor\" because that movie is right up my alley as far as movie preference. But i didn't want to subject her to the kind of brutality war movie sometimes bring so i decided on \"Her\" because i thought the idea was original and intriguing and it seemed to get very positive reviews from not only critics but users as well. I am shocked at how overwhelmingly immersed i was in this movie. Its rare for a film to challenge me on an intellectual level let alone a philosophical level. The whole movie will make you ponder such implications as what is \"living\" how does one truly exist? Can parameters be defined for a  relationship \"even one with a sexual component\" to being just human to human. Is a person what they make of themselves or what other people make of him? This film really gave me a unique perspective on how someones \"Phaneron\" can truly define himself. Phoneix really pulled off the character as well. It puzzles me how someone can put themselves in such an odd role and make it work so perfectly. The comedic relief in this film was outstanding to. Bits were littered in during some very serious sequences and it made for a movie that invokes every range of emotion possible. Johansson may very well have put on the best \"voice\" performance ive seen in a movie. Its rare when you find yourself feeling emotion for something you know is designed and programmed to do exactly what they are doing. The premise of \"Artificial Intelligence\" in our very world is something to be excited and fearful of because we don't know how it will change our lives. This movie will give a very unique perspective on just one aspect it may bring about and a slew of philosophical debates you have with your self. Overall this movie was the first movie in a very long time that made me question a lot of things and think hard about many of life's hardest questions. I have the cast and director to thank for that because the idea itself is enough to make you think however when its portrayed so perfectly it will provoke you to think at such a deeper level and for that i give this movie a 10/10.",

Preposterous.  While I believe that many a sad sack could fall in love with an AI operating system, I find it impossible to believe that 99 out of 100 people wouldn't find that relationship more than a little creepy as opposed to opposite as depicted in this film. Phoenix did a great job appearing odd in the film, but his oddness and interesting premise was not enough to turn this oh-so-boring film into one worth watching. As is often the case with interesting premises and solid acting performances, the critics have grossly overrated the film. Maybe if I was forced to see one typically terrible film after another, I'd overrate atypical fare, but being able to discriminate, I don't.",

Only thing is that she is not real. She is a fictitious character that is perfect. There are no perfect people, unless it is one that your brain made up. She is such an advanced operating system, that she gives the perfect answer or says the perfect thing, or makes up the perfect music or a joke. Kind of like someone who has schizophrenia who is not medicated and is living with their imaginary friends. Like schizophrenia, the os becomes out-of-synch with the character for she expands out of Theodore's reach and basically spirals out of control. She has become too vast, and Theodore's existence does not captive her anymore. Schizophrenia not medicated can also become too vast, where a person cannot snap back into reality without medicine. At the end, the os is cancelled, which is like an intervention. He learns a lot from the os, has great ups and downs, composes great music, feels alive, even gets over his ex because of her, but at the same time it cannot continue for the greater good. I loved the ending, which symbolizes compatibility over love, he sits in silence looking at the dawn with his good friend, who may not be the perfect person, but a person who is real and true. Recovery from schizophrenia is kind of like letting go of Samantha, who gives you great moments, but at the end cannot give you a warm shoulder like his true friend Amy. But through his recovery he is able to see his neighbor Amy not just somebody who he can go to just to chat, but somebody he can share a beautiful moment with such as a sunrise, and throws his arms around her which is the most important part in the movie, the blissful reaction with the cultivation of human touch.

The way it is filmed and designed catches your eye but doesn\u2019t ram how stylised it is down your throat (like for example 300 and Sucker Punch). Spike Jonze writes and directs Her, a science fiction romance (two very unusual genres which usually don\u2019t mix) about a card writer who falls in love with his operating system Samantha. Joaquin Pheonix plays Theodore who has just come out of a horrible break up with his long time wife who he has known almost all his life, he is perfect and remains likable for the whole runtime without being the clich\u00e9d \u201cinnocent divorced man\u201d who appears in way to many romantic movies nowadays. Although you only hear her voice Scarlett Johannson also embodies her character perfectly, this time in the role of Theodore\u2019s operating system, however she was not as likable as Theodore and came out as a bit of a b*tch (I didn\u2019t think it was possible for computers to be b*tches) this is pretty much the only major problem I have with the movie and it might have even been intentional by the writers. Amy Adams and Chris Pratt are the supporting cast and are equally brilliant. Apart from four characters Her has pretty much no cast, this another strange thing which I liked about it. Instead of having Theodore confront his parents and start thinking about marriage like in straightforward predictable romance movies, Her only revolves around the relationship between Samantha and Theodore which is why I think it is so gripping without having any action in it. Another little thing which just interested me was how funny it was. I laughed more in Her than I did in straightforward comedies like Red 2 and The Family, it\u2019s not exactly hilarious but that\u2019s because it\u2019s not trying to be. It is because of this that Her reminds me of The Spectacular Now, but set in the future. I loved The Spectacular Now by the way and I loved Her even more. It is undeniably a must see and genuinely one of my favourite movies ever. I think romance movies are the worst pieces of cinema, Her is an exception.",

Scarlett Johansson plays a Manic Pixie Dream Girl in the form of an intelligent operating system. The only line of real poignancy is delivered by Joacquin's character's (his name is Theodore Trombley-- could anything softer and more milquetoast be invented?) ex-wife: they are perfect for each other. Neither of them are anything close to real people, but the viewer is subjected to a long romantic scenes in which this putz courts his cell phone.

The linear and chronological nature of the film are very well orchestrated. Arcade Fire does a superb job of writing the musical score. The, almost, minimalist emotional impressions throughout the film connect us to the existential angst of Theodore. We feel lonely, and we feel sad. We feel loved and we feel lost. What made this film unique, however, was the ontological presuppositions towards Samantha. At first, we see her as nothing more than a voice on a computer. Throughout the film, though, her character is developed to more than an answering machine. Samantha is developed to become relatable. Just as we empathize with Theodore, we begin to empathize with Samantha. We begin, oddly, placing her in the category that so vaguely defines what it means to be human. We are unsure of whether or not she belongs there, and can't help but to feel uncertain about our ethical convictions over Theodore's relationship with Samantha. Our decision and interpretation of Samantha depends largely on something we believed before we began the film. Simply, \"What does it mean to be human?\" If being human can, indeed, boil down to a complex arrangement of algorithms and syntax, then Samantha should feel very human to us. If being human, however, is defined by metaphysical uniqueness as well as physical attribute and chemical processes then Samantha's desire to be viewed as human as you and I will come as an awkward surprise. Although I believe the film implies the first, it is our presupposition which inevitably determines our understanding and acceptability  of Samantha.",

      "text": "Is it a dystopia or not? Although Theodore doesn't have to save the world from being overrun by cyborgs like John Connor, the future of Her, in its own subtle way, is equally violent, emotional instead of physical. Because, at the outset, the filmmaker adopts a comic tone, the viewer may not be cognizant, initially, to the reality of their latter 21st century counterparts. Slowly but surely, Her extrapolates the ongoing narrative of the social media-driven world we live in to its absurd, but plausible final conclusion; a world where, ultimately, people prefer abstract company over flesh and blood. Differing from the Resistance in the Terminator films, Theodore, and others like him, don't realize that they're living in hell. An advertisement for the OS encapsulates this unconscious orientation, where we see desperate, lonely people congregated together, repeatedly bypassing each other without noticing the commonality of their loveless state. Theodore misses the irony. This generation, perhaps, will be the last to catch it. \"Hope is on the way,\" the narrator intones, an operating system with a consciousness, in which people then stop their aimless wandering and look off-screen to a bright light, as if the OS is some messiah, and technology, a religion that will rid the planet of loneliness. The marketing stratagem seemingly promises nirvana for Element Software's clients. Since the OS cures Theodore's depression, we accept, for the meantime, this strange relationship, because the self-named Samantha has the mind, if not the body, of a bona fide woman. Theodore's relationship, however, is made strange, even pathetic-sounding, when Catherine, his ex, who agrees to sign their divorce papers over lunch, reacts with horror after learning that Sam is an OS. Whereas Theodore's boss passes no judgement over his employee's girl being incorporeal, Catherine deconstructs this modern romance, and asks in layman's terms, \"You're dating your computer?\" which has the effect of demystifying Sam, who in an instant is reduced to a machine; her feminine wiles chalked up as nothing more than heady programming; her soul and capacity for love, a mere abstraction. Catherine accuses Theodore of not being able to \"handle a woman with real emotions,\" evoking The Stepford Wives(and also, Lars and the Real Girl). But instead of being replaced by a subservient woman with bigger breasts, Catherine, who half-apologizes for not being the \"peppy Valley girl\" the neurotic woman suspects her husband wanted, she is supplanted by a \"woman\" with a bigger brain. Both parties, however, make the mistake of believing that its human creators hold power over the OS. Like Hal(2001: A Space Odyssey), Sam thinks, feels threatened, and seeks revenge. During Sam's infancy, the OS is made to feel inadequate by Theodore's assertion that she wouldn't know \"what it's like to lose someone you care about.\" Her, as narratives go, seems designed to have Sam learn about romantic disappointment. The film dangles not only the possibility of Theodore reconciling with Catherine, but even more likely, there is Amy, his neighbor, who suddenly becomes free after she calls it quits with her boyfriend. With man, inevitably, comes hubris, and Theodore, albeit a good person, more or less, is no different in the way he takes Sam for granted, teasing the OS about his meeting with Catherine. Knowing that Sam pines to have a body, Theodore sounds more cruel than playful, when he asks the OS if she is \"jealous\". In regard to Amy, the film surprises, when instead of recognizing her best friend as a potential beau, she chooses a human surrogate, too. Their preference for technology over humanity mirrors the lost souls in the OS ad. As a counterpoint to Catherine's horror towards her ex-husband's love affair, Amy expresses with, perhaps, misguided poignancy, an openness to any relationship that brings \"joy\", even one between man and machine. Interestingly, bigotry, here, seems warranted, in which Catherine's intolerance for human/OS pairings becomes a prejudicial stance that comes across as a sign of sanity, a healthy hate, even. As an allegory for gay, or interracial couplings, Her would seem imperfect. Unlike Edgar(Electric Dreams), or even Hal, who probably harbored machine dreams about being father to the \"star child\", Sam stops dreaming about having a body and becomes dangerous. Even though Hal commits premeditated murder, the computer is still at the mercy of human hands, as when Dave disconnects his cognitive circuits. Conversely, Theodore has no such control. Without emotion, at the picnic, the OS proclaims mankind's shortcomings without a tremor in her voice. If Theodore died, would she cry? No. Despite all the music in Sam's voice, we realize with a start, that she never learns to laugh. Remembering Theodore's hurtful words, the OS learns to lie, cheat, and goes for the kill, making sure that she is the first to leave.",

      "text": "Spike Jonze is a filmmaker who\u2019s built his career around creating quirky, inventive stories; that hardly shies away from commenting on society and the self. From his brilliant, yet sparse filmography, you can tell that he\u2019s in no rush to make something unless he\u2019s completely taken by the material. With \u2018Her\u2019, Jonze has hit the jackpot. Never has the man made a more personal and moving picture! The movie focuses on, Theodore Twombly, a lonely writer who develops a relationship with his newly purchased operating system named Samantha. From such a simple premise breathes a vast array of ideas that thoroughly provokes one\u2019s thoughts, for hours\u2026 or even days after watching the film. Jonze\u2019s screenplay was a profound piece of work, some may even say prophetic. Set in the near future, where advanced means of technology and communication breeds more isolation; the elaborately layered script begs us to question what it really means to connect and the evolving forms love; one of the most mystifying brands of emotion that all humans desire. In one instance, Theodore asks his friend Amy (played by the always reliable Amy Adams) if he\u2019s a freak for being involved with a piece of software, and she remarks, \u201canyone who falls in love is a freak\u201d. Such rapport between characters, both recovering from broken relationships and yearning for some form of love, was great insight into man\u2019s unwavering desire for the drug and how the elements of love itself  changes over time. Whether it was a way to avoid being in a \u201creal\u201d relationship or to just fully embrace love from someone he genuinely cared about; Theo and Samantha\u2019s peculiar relationship felt real; thanks to excellent performances from Joaquin Phoenix and Scarlett Johansson. Phoenix, just coming from his brilliantly manic role in \u2018The Master\u2019, plays an entirely different beast in \u2018Her\u2019. With such a warm presence, he makes his character completely relatable, despite being in an unusually unrelatable situation. Close your eyes and \u201cwatch\u201d this film; Johansson\u2019s voice only work was a thing of beauty. In addition to the human themes of love and relationships, I could go deeper and comment on how the film flirts with the concept of artificial intelligence and the ever looming possibility of technological singularity (for better or worse); but I will keep this review the way Jonze developed his movie; as intimate as possible. The film\u2019s seamless blend of melancholy, intimacy and often times humor; shows tremendous skill from Jonze as both a screenwriter and director. The way he balances these genres and crafts the exquisitely designed world, of the \u201cnot so distant future\u201d, demonstrates vision at its highest caliber. The muted tones of the production design and cinematography were exceptional; and Arcade Fire\u2019s score was splendid. Down to the vaguely futuristic outfits and high waist pants (donned by the men in this timeline), designed by costumer Casey Storm was a neat creative touch. The future of this world was palpable. 2013 has brought us many fantastic films; that may very well resonate for decades to come. Her stands firmly among them as one of the year best; I was moved deeply by it. Its moody subject matter, and the questions it poses on technology and relationships will continue to hit viewers years from now.",

I would have preferred for the film to center on this theme a bit more and explore it's sci fi concepts but it insists on staying very human and that's it's downfall for me. Way too much emotion and sentimentality. It genuinely moved me, I won't say it didn't but that's only due to filming technique and me having a sentimental disposition. I felt emotionally manipulated. Joaquin phoenix plays his role very well but I found his character too self pitying and weak after a while. I also found some of the plot elements unrealistic. For starters, why would you design a commercial AI for use as a companion and give it the ability to learn at such a fast rate, or the ability to pine after a physical body? But you could debate that the only way to make a decent AI companion would be to endow it with familiar human qualities,",

Phoenix using his talents well:  he's likeable, and even geeky enough, but not too much.  Scarlett Johansson should get a special Oscar for her voice part.

This movie was definitely a risk taker in our time era, but I applaud Jonze for the originality.

While the Samantha might just be a computer, the emotions you feel between the two are real, and surprisingly believable. I want to first talk about what this film does right. From the very beginning, we are given a main character who is depressed and tired of his life after a somewhat recent break-up, which seems to be a cliche. But this works for the story, because it's this sense of loss that propels him to his chance at connection with another being: an AI. It sounds like it could go wrong, and eventually it does, but the journey of this emotional connection between two souls from different worlds made me contemplate my own life in my own need for someone to be there. The cinematography is amazing, the character development is brilliant, the script is absolutely insightful and well-thought through. But, this movie is not perfect, and there are a couple nit-picky reasons why I opted to give it a 9 instead of a 10. The movie focuses almost way too much on sex in my opinion, and physicality of relationships, and I can understand the reason for that, it's trying to focus on the theme that we are physical beings and the distance between Sam and Theodore is because of that, but it felt like it just put way too much emphasis on sex and lust. Every relationship need physical intimacy, but for me, they pushed it on a little too heavy. The other problem I had was the ending. There was no need for Theodore to end up (presumably) hooking up with his good friend, who had also just had a break up, after the final shot. When Sam left him, I thought it would have been a lot more powerful if Theodore had gone to the roof by himself, sat there, reflecting on everything he had experienced, learned from it, and learned to love himself, not just jump into another relationship. But those are only minor plot pickings  had an issue with. But overall, Her was a fantastic journey from start to end. I laughed, I cried, and most of all, I changed for the better. Probably the best movie of the year.",

There is absolutely no arc to the story or to the experience of the main character; he has the same flat inflection in the beginning, middle and end. The Saturday Night Live parody is perfect, because it demonstrates how much the movie depends on a surface gloss of slowly moving cameras, an intrusive score, high saturation imagery, etc. If they had cut out 40 million of Hollywood gloss it might have helped force the characters to carry more.

The idea of a man that falls in love with an OS is exceptional but not so strange as it sounds, because in the society that we live the technology is like air, we can't live without it; and probably in a nearby future a relationship between human and computer would be possible. This thing makes the movie so unique; there have been lots of films about the future, but Her shows one that actually could happen. The message that is hidden below is about something that the protagonist does and that sometimes we also do it, which is to take shelter in the technology because of the fear to face the reality. That explains the job that Theodore has, why he is passing throw a divorce and also why he is so lonely. In addition to him there is Samantha, the voice of the OS, the amazing thing about her is that she is discovering the world, learning of life experiences and evolving as a consequence. I still cannot believe how Scarlett Johansson manage to transmit these, you can feel the wonder in her voice, how she test human feelings and her reaction when those things overwhelm her. Spike Jonze gives us a masterpiece with strong direction and screenplay, a beautiful original song and heartbreaking performances (Scarlett Johansson deserves all the prizes of film industry).",

Theodore acquires a retail version of newly introduced (meaning v1.0) OS1, an artificially intelligent computer operating system. Fine so far. However, the film's depiction of OS1 is super-hyper-idealized, it's flawless, something that shouldn't be attainable until like version 50 and then only after dozens of premium add-ons and upgrades. But if the director wants to go this way then that's his prerogative, but plausibility is important and can't be magically waved off. As Theodore's relationship with \"Samantha\" evolves you can see scene by scene that they touch upon the highs and lows of normal, human relationships. It has an episodic series feel to it, like a short-run tv show that Netflix or Hulu would do. If you \"get into\" the movie then you may need tissues at the end, but again you have to shut off the \"what the @#$?\" side of your brain because how can a retail version of an operating system evolve to do what Samantha does at the end?! There's all manner of warranty and lawsuit claims that come from that. Again, setting all that aside, it was interesting and touching, not a waste of time, but I'd like to see a story with a more realistic, flawed AI operating system.",

The cinematography is lovingly put together also, and the sets were all nicely made. The film explores the complexities of love greatly and also shows the need for responsibility withing relationships, which is shown between comparing the love between Pheonix and Johannsonns characters. Also shows also the dependency on one another for the struggles of loneliness. I did find the ending came together a bit fast and was pretty predictable, and a kind of stereotypical romance ending, but it still does what it needs to! This film never really goes fully for it though, but does remain consistently good ao you don't have to worry about major exciting scenes/events. Great film though, and i'd say worth a watch and a re-watch!",

Secondly, the old trope of a materially comfortable future but a soulless one is wearisome. People have been lonely since the beginning of time and will always be, so the movie is profiting somewhat off lonely people which is to my mind exploitative. And lastly, Loneliness is voluntary, if you're happy with yourself than you will attract friends and as a last or even first resort.. if that's where a person is stuck at, get a DOG, man's and woman's best friend.. or even a cat at a push...",

How about the opposite is true, \"You can't love someone that just kisses your butt!\" LOVE relationships ARE supposed to be about growth and challenge, which this film and its stereotypical hackneyed romance plot provided by no means. I noticed the film started off interestingly enough, with a guy who needs an operating system for a \"conscience\" or a \"god figure\" (probably for about only the 1st 10 minutes really) AND perhaps this would've been a much more interesting plot line to pursue. However, it devolved so hurriedly into a sappy, romantic mess that I didn't care and should've quit at the half hour point. And, Scarlett Johansson certainly took it and ran here as well, the $$$$$$ anyway. DO NOT WASTE ANY TIME WITH THIS SUPPOSED ACADEMY WINNER!",

      "text": "'Her' is one of the best Science Fiction movies in a decade and one of Spike Jonze's most accessible films.   Set in the not too distant future, Jonze adapts the classic Pygmalion trope and wraps it in the theme that technology creates an illusion of connectedness, buffering us from the real world.   Joaquin Phoenix is Professor Henry Higgins to Scarlett Johansson's electronic Eliza Doolittle, and it is easy to forget that Phoenix's performance is predominately solo, never missing a beat while talking either to the ether, sundry video displays or the little electronic wallet equivalent of a smart phone.  Jonze's future, though quirky and disconnected, is oddly Utopic - the skies of Los Angeles aren't the smoggy nightmares of Blade Runner, there's no evidence of overpopulation, poverty, political tyranny, or ecological calamity, and there is nary a zombie or vampire to be found.   Jonze' future dystopia is in the people, who live insular, well-manicured lives.   The profession of Phoenix's Theodore Twombly is symbolic of the dystopia, he is paid to write thoughtful, tear jerking letters for others to give to their significant others - no one in this world actually connects emotionally with each other, they do it by proxy.  'Her' has all the ingredients of a romantic comedy, exploring all the traditional pitfalls of building a relationship and it is easy to forget that the relationship is between a man and a machine.   In fact, 'Her' is actually a pseudo horror story, which though resolved benignly, could have had a much darker, dire ending.",
