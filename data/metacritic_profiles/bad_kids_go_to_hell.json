The \"Bad Kids\" were cast exceptionally well. One of the most surprising talents was Jeffrey Schmidt, who played Dr. Day. His quirky character was hilarious, as were many of the unexpected music video style flashback scenes that had the whole theater laughing out loud. This is definitely one of those movies that you'll want to see with others. Instant cult classic!",

And the end is KILLER. And a GREAT soundtrack.",

Despite the fact that there were several amusing scenes as a \"horror movie\" it failed to be fully satisfying. Several characters that were detestable lived and the film had two twists. The first of which wasn't bad but the second twist (which occurred in the scene directly after the previous twist) was just plain silly. The film had potential but the writing (and fake looking roaches and rain) really held it back from being achieved.",

From the library, the character traits of the kids, (only more modern and less wholesome), who make up the cast, right down to the awesome Judd Nelson cameo as Head Master. The flaw (which is minor) is that it seemed to go hardcore in referencing the 80\u2019s high school flick but sadly no real dialogue reverb from the movie, what - not one kid could have found a way to declare \u201cI wanna be just like you. I figure all I need, is a lobotomy and some tights\u201d. Okay, I know new decade , new social commentary. The film does have some very awesome quotable moments that I loved, my fave \u201cI don\u2019t worship the devil, I just promote him\u201d. The cast where killer in their role and all had more than enough back story and depth of personality to bring the characters to life. I did want a bit more bravado, overt-expression from a couple of the characters. I thought they where more subdued than they should have been, but still the acting was stellar. Plus a hot cast can hardly ever go wrong.",
