When there is something she cares about and gets animated it comes off as \"I'm so perky!  Listen to me because I'm perky!\"  She is always flustered, is dropping things on the ground, and her face usually has a vaguely incredulous look on it.  Enough examples yet?  Hooray for Harrison Ford and Jeff Goldblum who verbally smack her down like the yappy dog she is playing.  This movie reminds me why I hate morning shows.  At one point, Rachel tells Harrison that there was a war between news and entertainment, and news lost.  So did America.  Shows such as the Today Show, Good Morning America, and the Early Show are just ridiculous.  God forbid Americans learn what happened over night in other countries while brewing their coffee.  Ford's dialogue saves this film from being a total loss.  \"You want me to banter?  Isn't banter from the Latin word meaning to jabber like a moron?\"  Responding to Diane Keaton who says, \"I had to say rectal and moisture in the same sentence\" he retorts with \"Well, first dates can be tricky.\"  These lines are few and far between and do not make up for the rest of this nonsense.",

      "text": "Contemporary films are edited to death. It's a criticism made over and over again, ad nauseum, by old people with long memories. In Robert Altman's \"The Player\", a security guard grouses to his much younger colleague about how \"everything these days is all cut, cut, cut,\" citing Orson Welles' \"Touch of Evil\", with its long opening shot as a dramatic counterpoint to the chopping speed of modern movies, while they traverse the studio lot. Walter Stuckel(Fred Ward) remembers \"Network\", a filmic augury about the encroaching sensationalizing of broadcast journalism, which \"Morning Glory\" clearly descends from. While the sunny child birthed from Sidney Lumet's loins may have some of 1976's looks, along with 1987's congeniality(James Brooks raised it), \"Morning Glory\" differs in this very important aspect: the news industry's degradation into its current information/entertainment hybrid that both \"Network\" and \"Broadcast News\" prognosticated from their own respective eras were, at the time, still a laughing matter, extrapolative art which bore the habiliments of satire. Concerning the state of the news, \"Morning Glory\" is post-stupid, and has no qualms about it. The devil's minion doesn't carry a pitchfork, but give Becky Fuller(Rachel McAdams) time, and she will, as the producer of \"Daybreak\" helps drag the low-rated morning show to hell without any regard for the hallowed industry's past that she professes to love, all in the name of the bottom line: ratings, and the glory that comes along with the territory, ephemeral as it may be. Becky, a thoroughly modern update of the Faye Dunaway character in \"Network\", is a 24/7 workaholic with little room for a personal life, just like Diana Christensen, the programming chief for the UBS network, but since McAdams' character turns up in a light, breezy comedy, and can light up a room with her megawatt smile, unlike Dunaway's dour, lipsticked shark, the ramifications for the industry that follows Becky's success may not be as readily apparent. It's a crying shame that the tenacious woman settles for being a pawn of the status quo, rather than aim to be a proponent for change, because she's clearly dynamic enough to exact a revolution. Together with Mike Pomeroy(Harrison Ford), a lion in the news biz(cut from the same mode as Walter Cronkite) who takes the \"Daybreak\" gig for the money, Becky could restore news to the news division. And should their best-laid plans fail to procure traction with the general public, at least the producer can say she fought the good fight. Her utter competency, especially her hyper-ability to process information is the film's comic highlight, when Becky proves her mettle during a production meeting on her first day, in which she answers all of her staff's questions with rapid-fire economy, an exhilarating retort to the bombardment of information that seemingly overwhelms her. The MTV-style editing that Walter Stuckel hates is a reflection of her fast mind. More often than not, the camera's reluctance to linger on a subject for any length of time is purely a commercial matter, but in \"Morning Glory\", the conventional editing style is predicated on an adducible tangent; it prevents Becky from getting self-introspective. If this woman-on-the-go stopped for one second and examined the damage that she presides over on a daily basis, as the network news producer(played by Holly Hunter) does in \"Broadcast News\", in which the filmmaker utilizes a long take, time enough for Jane Craig to have a good cry, maybe she would have second thoughts about replacing the show's soporific segments from its prior incarnation with pure spectacle, and listen to Pomeroy's heeding for a return to old school journalism. Since the newsman's cries fall on deaf ears, more or less(the two, however, do reach a compromise that allows for SOME substance in the program), \"Morning Glory\" should have forewent the motions of a romantic comedy(by dropping the needless love interest, as played by Patrick Wilson), and mirrored the May/December romance between Dunaway and William Holden, by pairing up Becky with the older man, as well. Despite the sex, Max never compromised his integrity, as it pertained to his professional life, whereas Mike Pomeroy joins the riffraff, selling himself out through reinvention. Donning an apron for a cooking demonstration, a trusted voice in America's living rooms suddenly becomes a comradely one; he turns into Regis. Worse than Diane Christensen, Becky has a touch of evil that's even more insidious, more far-reaching Diane captured a groin. No biggie. Becky, however, captured a soul.",

The title is apt not only in the fact it describes what Becky (Rachel Mcadams) is trying to return the show to but it also describes the feel of the film. Its a feel of cheerful possibility as if after the film is over you have the rest of the day to enjoy. Its a film that is undeniably chipper and is all the better for it. In Becky's quest to help the show regain some credibility (and hopefully some ratings) she enlists the help of legendary news anchor Mike Pomeroy (Harrison Ford), a washed up presenter whose career has hit a low point. He begrudgingly accepts a position at Daybreak where his sarcastic wit and his contempt for all things morning show drive people up the wall, especially his co-anchor Colleen (Diane Keaton). The film works Ford for every ounce of sarcasm he has and in doing so infuses some much needed comedy into the proceedings (especially in his interaction with Keaton). Mcadams proves a talented lead (much like she does in The Time Travellers Wife) as her perky demeanour fits the character of Becky whose eternal optimism is entertaining even when it borders on naivety. She and Ford have great chemistry and their scenes towards the end of the film are delightfully heartfelt giving the ending real heart unlike most modern relationship comedies. The cast is rounded out by some equally talented comic actors like Patrick Wilson and John Pankow. Pankow gives a particularly entertaining performance as ever cynical producer Lenny Bergman. The writing is quick and funny while also allowing for some touching moments, specifically between Ford and McAdams with the direction emphasising the light cheerful tone the film is going for. All in all it works really well and if it is let down anywhere it is in its beginning which seems a little too cornball but it soon shakes it off with a good dose of grumpy Ford which everyone loves, even if they don't want to admit it.",
