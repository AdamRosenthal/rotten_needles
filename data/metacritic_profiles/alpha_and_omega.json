      "text": "Winston(Danny Glover) is a wolf without sons, so the father, by default, sends his oldest daughter Kate(Hayden Panetiere) to alpha school because she's the heir apparent; the alpha female in-waiting. How does that make him feel, the pack leader, the envy of other wolves, having to rely on a girl for daily sustenance, fresh caribou meat, and in the future, leadership, when the time comes for Winston to hand over the reins of power? Surely, he'd much rather have his successor be an alpha male, just like his old \"man\". After Kate returns home without a kill, neither father nor daughter acknowledges the elephant in the room(well, in this case, forest), a notion about lacking, which must weight heavily on both wolves' minds, yet goes unexpressed. Even though Kate comes from good stock, all the alpha training in the world can't offset the physical disadvantages of her gender, relative to the male, who is stronger, faster, and more fierce, more wolf-like. But at the risk of seeming too \"Mulan\", the film addresses the father's latent paternal malcontentment over having girls in a roundabout fashion, by having the wolf blame the unsuccessful hunt on eastern wolves, then employing him in the highly unusual position of matchmaker, in which Winston brokers a connubial union with another alpha male, an enemy father who has a marriageable son, Garth(Chris Carmack), as a means to unite both packs. That's pretty convoluted. Since when do wolves consolidate? Wolves are territorial. If Winston had sons, and outsiders infringed on their hunting grounds, he'd make war, not peace, and have his warriors rip the trespassers' throats out. With her long eyelashes and well-brushed mane, Kate looks too high-maintenance for killing; she'd probably much prefer being a girl, just like her sister Lilly(Christine Ricci). Out of desperation, Kate is allowed to marry Humphrey(Justin Long), an omega, a wolf beneath her station, because his daughter is no hunter, no leader of wolves.",

      "text": "To begin, this is a mediocre movie.  It deserves a 5.  No more, no less.  I give it a 7 for two reasons.  First, to attempt to balance out the negative reviews, and second, because I am one of the few people who thoroughly enjoyed the movie (who is not under the age of 10).  It has many things going for it.  The plot was the perfect balance between a simple Cinderella story and a more complex, for lack of a better word, political story.  The voice acting is well done, the animation is competent and deserves more credit than others give, and the characterization and development make you truly care about the main characters.  One of the major problems with the film is the rest of the writing.  Most of the jokes are extremely over-the-top, slapstick, or toilet-related.  The plot, as I said before, is a good balance and kept my attention, but it is not sure of its target audience.  The childish jokes might appeal to, well, children, while the emotional predicament might appeal to teenagers, and the political situation might appeal to adults.  The mixed-in sexual references are out-of-place in what seems to be a children's movie.  If, like me, you approach the movie as less of an animated comedy and more of a mature love story, you might appreciate it a bit more.  The original soundtrack is outstanding, and fit well with the themes of the scenes the songs were used it.  The \"Moonlight Howl\" as I believe they called it in the movie is an interesting concept, and if the introduction to it, a duet between two rather strange-looking wolves, wasn't as...creepy...it would have made a better impression.  The later \"howls\" throughout the movie are well done and the emotion-filled singing voices work very well.  The pairing of the singer with the character's voice actor does not work well in many cases, including Humphrey's.  There are also a few moments where the vowel sound in the music doesn't match the shape of the animated character's mouth, particularly in the later scene between Humphrey and Kate.  The body movements of the wolves are also well done, especially in the opening scene where Humphrey's **** head and his bending down to see through Winston's legs illustrate the character's youth and playfulness.  Now I've said all I have to say, and I hope that the reported sequel under development will fulfill its potential.",

The plot is a mix of Romeo and Juliet Balto, The Incredible Journey and A Midsummer Night's Dream and uses the laziest cliches in animation including near the end after the stampede where Kate is knocked out cold from what it looked like it killed her. Humphrey thought she's dead without even checking her breathing her heartbeat and big surprise she's alive (who by the way is the one who didn't tell Humphrey that she has an arranged marrage which made him think Kate doesn't love him). Another bad thing is having all those big name actors like Danny Glover the late Dennis Hopper and Christina Ricci having their acting talents gone to waste. The most mediocre part is the humor and the constant howling which is not how mating rituals work and they howl more time than Warren Zevon. The sexual undertones were so bizarre that it almost as though some nutcase used another script just to make us care for the two leads. The most noticeable flaw is the animation which was done in India but pre production and post production were done in America which you could say is an insult to Indians.
