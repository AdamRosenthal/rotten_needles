No, it is not original, but it is also not a stupid and empty slasher fest, full of blood and gore where the director just goes \u201cboo!\u201d at you every few minutes.

However after maybe 40 odd minutes, the film devolves into something more like scary movie or drag me to hell. All suspense is lost as we see the beastie who is behind everything (a dude with a goat's head) and we hear about the back story of the doll, which is nonsense.

The writing is incredibly mediocre with characters that are weak (and dumb), a script which is thin with a few holes and a plot which is unoriginal, predictable and just plain dumb. Apart from a nice period art design, the production is bland and feels very cheap. Joseph Bishara's score is also a disappointment; it is far from as memorable as Insidious' score and The Conjuring's score. The Conjuring had great performances; Annabelle - not so much. The performances feel fairly wooden and boring and do not really bring much life to the characters. I am not sure if the dull characters are to blame for this or if the actors are just not very good. Despite these flaws, I did not dislike the film - Annabelle does have its good moments, such as a few cool well-constructed scenes (e.g. Basement/Elevator) which make the film enjoyable at times, as well as a few references to real life events and other films such as Rosemary's Baby, which, I thought, was a rather interesting choice. Overall, Annabelle has a nice art design, a few cool moments and is enjoyable at times, but the script is weak, the characters are dumb and it ultimately feels cheap. As a theatrical film, it does not work - but it would make a great direct-to-DVD film.",

In fact the first real scene of horror is one of which Hitchcock could be proud. The attractive leads are also better than the usual cyphers placed in these types of films and the story is generally quite logically played out. References to Polanski's 'Rosemary's Baby' abound and there are definitely shocks to be had along the way. One sequence involving a sewing machine, a hob and some popcorn is cut to elicit maximum tension. Two supporting players are effectively presented with menacing undertones, but the movie's biggest mystery remains why anyone would want to own such a sinister looking doll in the first place. The final scenes become somewhat predictable, but I must say that it sets up the scenario for last year's' The Conjuring' very nicely, and is actually preferable.",
