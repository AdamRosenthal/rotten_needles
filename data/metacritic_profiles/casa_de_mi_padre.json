      "text": "This film has a lot of Tim and Eric style humor, as does a lot of Will Ferrell projects these days. I did laugh a good deal while watching this film, however the pacing was kind of off. Like a super ridiculous scene followed by a \"heartfelt\" one. It just felt kind of inconsistent. I think that's part of the problem of relying too much on surrealist humor, it can get old fast and too much of it makes the story incoherent, so it was applied in small doses. All that aside, Will Ferrell does an excellent in an all Spanish-speaking role. Fans of Will Ferrell's more recent works will probably enjoy this.",

The poorly made shots, low budget special effects, and overly dramatic elements of the story are portrayed with mostly a straight face. The humor here is very meta.",

The actors stay deep in character at all times, the story and scenes move along without stalling, and there are a lot if visual pleasures here. The purposely bad sets and effects not only spoof old Mexican films and telenovelas, but are refreshingly artistic in an era when even crappy American movies and TV shows have way too much budget dedicated to 'professional' production values that end up just looking boring by comparison. The art direction is really quite good. The title sequence alone is a beautiful tribute to 70's art. And if you understand Spanish and Mexican efforts at understanding English, the crazy subtitles are hilarious! My only complaints are a slightly long ending that sort of goes all over the place, and the film is a bit too violent in several places (for a comedy).",

They mock traditional Spanish westerns and the like throughout the film. Will Ferrell is genius. Genesis Rodriguez is breathtaking. Overall, it's just a really funny and silly movie that doesn't take itself seriously. I can't give it a higher rating because it's not that kind of movie. That being said, it's still a movie that certain people will really enjoy, myself being one of them.",

      "text": "This is the best way i can put this.  If you've seen \"Black Dynamite\" and liked it, you'll probably love this.  here's the caveat.  \"Black Dynamite\" is a movie about blaxploitation films that were churned out to cash in on the success of \"Shaft.\" Few of them really tried to be good.  This is a love letter to the tellanovella, in the form of an early 80's western.  I have a feeling that some of the people making tellanovellas actually believe that they're doing something with quality and weight.  This movie takes itself seriously, which makes it more absurd, but in a quieter way.  It really helps to have had spanish in high school, because you will read the subtitles much faster, since your brain already has some idea what's being said whether you know it or not.  This allows you to notice more of the subtleties.  There are so many consistency errors.  I'm not talking about the plentiful \"now he has a cig, now he doesn't, now he does\" moments.  I'm talking about extras being filled out with mannequins, or a wedding massacre victim casually smoking away because he doesn't know he's on camera.  At the same time, there isn't one single technology or fashion anachronism ever.  Comedy is like horror.  What one person finds effective, another thinks is terrible.  I thought this movie was hilarious, but I understand that few will agree.  Hope this lets you know if you're one of the few that does.",
