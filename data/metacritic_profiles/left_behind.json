No, not all of the movie was great, there were some cheesy moments. This is kept to a minimal however, and I felt that the movie really did to a good job of keeping characters in your thoughts, and actually made you care about them in some way. No, if you are not a Christian you will probably not like the movie. In the same way, I feel that a lot of the hate towards this movie is that it is not mainstream.",

When I saw the trailers I was a little apprehensive in that Hollywood has a way of butchering some of the best books and making them into movie disasters but this one takes the cake. This book is suppose to be about the apocalypse. How did it get to be about Nicholas Cage piloting a plane and the peoples reactions  and about Cassi Thompson saving the plane and just a little about the rapture. Firstly Cassi Thompson as Chloe Steele was grossly misrepresented and Nicholas Cage as Rayford Steele was laughable the state of shock he was in for the entire movie was hilarious. My advice for anyone watching this movie, read the books you'll enjoy them more. Movie was poorly made, poorly taught out, should have stuck to the book it would have made the movie Epic!. So disappointed, always wanted this book series to be made into a movie and then This Happens. Will not recommend this to anyone. SMH.",

We're not there to criticize and dissect. So I'm starting to think I might just have to read what the users have to say and they were right about \"Left Behind.\" It's not a movie to be taken seriously, however, it had a lot of serious thoughts about religion in it. I also think it had funny moments that were not intentional, but that often happens in movies that are trying to be too serious, and it makes the movie better. I saw the \"Exorcist\" and everyone was laughing the whole way through the movie. Good thing because I was scared to death watching it. \"Left Behind\" had its moments of scariness, humor and absurdity. The acting was fine. However, at times some of the acting was way exaggerated for the scene, which means, it's the director's fault. Like the actors would be really scared, then calm down too quick in the next scene even though the problem is getting worse. That's not bad acting, that's bad directing and bad editing. But we still liked the movie. We try to go to all the religious movies that make you think, not the ones that praise religion. But we especially like the religious movies with action (The Matrix had a lot of religious undertones). Boyfriend is a believer, I'm not sure if I am, but I used to be. So we saw the movie with different mind frames and still enjoyed it because it showed how different people are about religion. I'd be like Nicholas Cage. Give me a sign and I'm believing again. The only cheesy part of the movie was when the daughter cleared a \"runway\" with a truck for her father to land a crippled plane full of scared people. Yet I thought it was very creative and resourceful how they used the cell phone to locate one another. I'll have to remember that next time I'm lost with no landmarks, like people who get lost in the woods. Of course, you have to have cell phone reception for it to work. The movie is not perfect. It is what it should be. Makes you think while it entertains.",

The acting in the beginning is bad (though I don't usually watch movies for it, sometimes bad acting is noticeable), the dialogue was very lazy, and the writers didn't even take into consideration how normal conversations between two average people go. The conversation between the mother and the daughter quickly ends before people can get a grasp on it, some background elements (such as clothing falling from parts of the sky where people obviously weren't standing) made no sense at all, and sometimes it felt as though the set and practical effects designers got lazy or were high on drugs. Overall, it is a bad movie. Real bad. You just need to really watch the movie, and ignore all the negatives, and you probably will have a good time with it.",

I'm a non-believer but that hasn't swayed my judgement of this truly terrible film. The bible is a great story book, but this didn't work. in any way. honestly. its awful.",

The whole idea of everyone disappearing because god is angry at them it just felt really silly and i don'think i will be watching this movie ever again",
