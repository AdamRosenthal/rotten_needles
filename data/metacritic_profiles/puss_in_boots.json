If you do not compare this film directly to the Shrek movies, which bombards you with jokes and such, then I believe you will enjoy this movie more.    Another thing that stems negativity is that people believe there is too much adult humor for a children's movie.

Antonio Banderas returns the voice as \"Puss in Boots\", Salma Hayek voice as \"Kitty Softpaws\", Zack Galifianakis voice as \"Humptey Alexander Dumptey\", and of course \"Jack & Jill\" was voice by Billy Bob Thornton and Amy Sedaris. Those characters are fun to watch and they did pretty well such as Banderas and Hayek since they team up in \"Desperado.\" Most importantly, the animation was wonderful and I saw this movie once again in 3D. It's very beautiful and I can see the background that the 3D could take you anywhere and its done well since the animation brings 3D to see.

All the other characters were great. Every actor's voice matched perfectly with their character. Of course, we all know Antonio Banderas (as Puss in Boots), but even Zach Galifianakis (as Humpty Dumpty) and Salma Hayek (as Kitty Softpaws) did a wonderful job. The comic moments were cleaver, and they all had the perfect timing (essential in comedy). It also has that Mexican style, with the songs and all that. It funny for me, because in this movie (including Shrek) they make fun of fairy tales. So the creators put all type of stereotypes and representation for each fairy tale character (like Puss in boots is Spanish). This movie didn't lose that sort of '' humor ''. A thing that I founded interesting was, in some scenes, they splited the screens, to show different places at the same time. They made fun of that, which was cool.

Puss in Boots was what I expected - interesting characters, some great laughs (including the Shrek-like humor for adults only), and an interesting backstory. Unfortunately, no cameos from major Shrek characters. The star of the movie was definitely Banderas's Puss. If you liked the character from previous movies, you will not be disappointed. Salma Hayak as Kitty Softpaws was decent enough although not very memorable in any way. And finally, Zach Galifianakis's Humpty Dumpty will be a polarizing character in my opinion. If you thought Rumpelstiltskin from Shrek Forever After was a tad on the annoying side, I think you'll feel the same way about Humpty Dumpty.. Anyways, the story is good. The integration of former players in nursery rhymes and fairy tales is seamless. And the comedy is standard Shrek-style delivering lots of laughs for children and the occasional adult-only joke. The visuals are stunning. And the music is fantastic. It almost felt like an action-packed spaghetti western with a Latin flavor. I definitely enjoyed myself. I also talked to quite a few people afterwords and the consensus was that the children all loved it and the adults kept using the word \"cute\" in so many different ways to describe their feelings about the movie.",

Unexpectedly though, there is a strong point in the writing, where there are scenes in the story that give hints to what will happen next without making the predictable boring. The action, travel and fight scenes are a definite treat; the film features top-notch animation of scenery. At the very least, seeing the movie will satisfy people's want to know Puss's story, and that enough makes it watchable and gives the watcher something to remember it by, but of course no one could forget Antonio Banderas's majestic portrayal of Puss.

The script is tightly woven and links together well giving an emotional backstory that is worthy of the required character arcs. The animation is as solid as you expect from Dreamworks as is the A-list voice cast. It is potentially Humpty Alexander Dumpty that steals the show here who is well voiced by Zach Galifianakis. There are stumbles, especially after the halfway mark where it all threatens to fall to pieces but the final act does bring it back on track despite not hitting the initial laugh count. There are laughs, action, fairy tale and darkness and all comes together to make a thoroughly enjoyable film. Shrek it isn't quite but it certainly beats some of the poorer animation efforts.",
