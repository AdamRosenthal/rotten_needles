Mark Wahlberg was great as usual! \"Battleship\" star Taylor Kitsch also gave another great performance. Emile Hirsch was really good, as was the highly underrated Ben Foster. The story was really well done and the action was intense and delivered!

Sorry getting off course...acting was very believable and loved the back ground music...Peter Berg did a fine job off telling this unbelievable story of our real life super heroes.

What carried the narrative along, so that it wasn't just a shoot out, (although one of those scenes went on too long for my taste), was careful editing, back and forth between two or three narratives. And what carried the day, was not patriotism, but the the band of men, fighting together. The four men, were admirable, although I wasn't completely happy with either Mark Wahlberg's character or acting, I'm not sure why, I seemed to have the sense that he wasn't in the fight as much as the other men, as if the star needs to be saved at the end, and I dislike having to say that, because I am sure the real life hero fought as bravely as the others. The script and dialog were tight. The film showed war at its bloodiest, most fatal, hand-to-had combat. And also had an interesting plot twist at the end showing the humanity of a culture other than our own. Interspersed with the fighting shots were wide angle natural beauty: supposed to be a mountainous range in Afghanistan; the film was shot in New Mexico. The film's credits at beginning and end - stay all the way to the end - nicely framed the picture in our real country's heroes. The entire theater audience with whom I saw the picture, applauded the film at the end, and at the end of the credits. Films don't often get that kind of praise.",

The acting was phenomenal and the main guys, Mark Wahlberg, Ben Foster, Emile Hirsch, and especially Taylor Kitsch, who I thought stole the movie, really deliver. They are able to establish an incredible rapport and level of camaraderie in a very short time so credit to them for them. The combat scenes, which make up essentially three-quarters of the film, were done excellently as well. Peter Berg really delivered here. The movie was gruesome, bloody, gory, and felt real because of those often subtle but occasionally dramatic sequences. Another thing I loved about the film was the sense that, more than just a movie, it was a dedication to those who lost their lives and have done so for our freedom throughout our history. The 5-minute intro with real-life footage from BUD/S training and hell week started in and then the photo/video montage of the heroes who died in the battle after the film completed it. Bravo again to Berg for that. Lastly, I loved that Marcus Luttrell had a role in the film itself. He is in several scenes and it was very unexpected when he first popped up in a scene.",

The way the characters act are typical for a modern war movie. You have your everyman, leader, tech-guy, trigger happy guy and it's the trigger happy guy I found myself agreeing with the most. He wants to kill 3 people cause he knows they'll tell the Taliban in the area their whereabouts. If they had done that they would have avoided their real fate. If this movie taught me anything it's that the Geneva Convention is out dated and doesn't apply to war in the 21st century. The action is good, realistic and will make you cringe at some points, but the story is cliche' and honestly a little dull. It's okay at best but it won't make much of an impression on you.",

'Lone Survivor' is an Afghanistan-set war film about a special-ops mission, that goes horribly wrong, and it features one of the years finest sound mixes and some gritty scene to get the blood pumping. Where I can give the film applause for these visceral technical aspects, I can't give such praise to the things that matters most. Its funny that a movie so firmly built on comradery, features a hokey group dynamic between these imperiled soldiers. Everything in this relationship felt cliched; without being true and moving. Undeveloped characterizations was the blame for this; but what would you expect when the movie cares more about thrilling audiences with action sequences rather than moving them with depth. I also took issue with the film's heavy-handed delivery of its message of patriotism and courage; and how it paints its Middle Eastern villains with limited shades. They are simply relegated to being \"the bad guys\". In the end 'Lone Survivor' was a feast for the eye and ears, but has little to offer for the brain.",

While the movie lacks solid character biulding it surpasses in its action and realism. Some of the fire fights they get into are brutally intense thats were the realism takes it to another level. The cast was great for the film Mark Wahlberg, Ben Foster, Eric Bana, Emile Hirsch, Taylor Kitsch all did amazing jobs for thier portrayal as the soldiers. Its a very emotional movie seeing the team try and try again to get saved but only to fail again and again also i think will shock some people when they watch it because of the realism style. Peter Berg really surprised me with this one his past couple movies i didnt really care for and seeing that the last movie i liked of his was The Kingdom another war based film it seems he can do this genre pretty well.",

This film is exactly what it says, brutal and realistic. It is because of these factors that the film is so immersive! The intro is great for understanding what these seals go through in training and gives you a respect for them right off the bat. The start of the actual movie is a bit boring and typically americanised in a way, but it works for elements later on in building the characters and actually freling genuinely sorry for any characters loss which not too many movies can pull off this well in this realistic and actually emotionally distressing way. The middle section of this movie is unmissable and the main reason you should pick up this film. Also, direction in this middle section is superbly done. Bravo Peter Berg. The last section loses steam but is still a good and actually satisfying ending to see. I also like how an american film pays it's respects to afghani's and pays homage to the tribes law they follow. A lot of american films could have easily missed that out just to pay respects to the americans. I say this is a great movie in many ways, and well worth a visit! Pick it up!",

Secondly, the film begins in a cliched almost fawning way, with the (what seems now standard) portrayal of Seals as warm hearted,, cuddly, lovely guys who are just doing a job. Whether it's true or not, this seems to be the standard way such movies start these days, with a kind of implication that special forces soldiers are societies moral exemplars, and it's getting really boring. Thirdly, the ending is the standard \"cavalry arrives in a nick of time\" conclusion that is very disappointing and cliched, and had nothing to do with the book. I don't believe the protagonist died and was revived in real life either.

It oozes so much testosterone that is literally drips off of the screen. I have never been a fan of war movies, especially American ones. In fact the last American war film I actually appreciated was \u201cThe Hurt Locker\u201d, which was much better directed than this blood bath. I mean, this film is well acted and the photography is wonderful, but the direction is not up to great standards and the script is kind of uneven and lacks a sense of humor which a film like this really does need. The film works best when it briefly explores the relationship between Wahlberg and some villagers.",

      "text": "Lone Survivor is an amazing motion picture that captures the horrors of war and what happened to those Navy Seals. The movie stars Mark Wahlberg, Taylor Kitsch, Emile Hirsch, Ben Foster, and Eric Bana in Iraq in 2005, when the four men go through hell trying to survive in the Afghan Mountains against the militia Taliban. Now this movie nails everything perfectly in trying to be true to the story, the acting was something to remember, and the action was very intense. But the movie made it difficult to understand what the Afghan villagers were actually saying, there were little to no subtitles for them. But overall, Lone Survivor tops my top 5 war movies that were based on a true story at number 3.",
