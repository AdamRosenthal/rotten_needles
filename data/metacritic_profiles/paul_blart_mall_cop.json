This comedy is waste of humor and basically the cast sucks. Another sappy comedy when Sandler's production company (Happy Madison) wastes talent comedic actors to this garbage material, even people like James are talented it takes a script to ruin it all. Let's not forget the action scenes holy **** there so bad Grade D-",

Bottom line: If you can't stand fat jokes, then this isn't for you. But if you like a good, dumb slapstick comedy, then Paul Blart: Mall Cop is worth a look. 7/10.",

It is not a well made family movie by any means but it is a movie where you shut your brain off for an hour and half and not put too much thought into it. The women i forget her name did a nice job as paul blarts love interest as well. Overall this movie is very entertaining for what the actors were given. It's nothing spectacular that you need to see immediately but still tends to be alot fun.",
