She portrays her character in such an endearing way yet at the same time is utterly hilarious. The rest of the cast is also fantastic. Rose Byrne is great with her constant put downs and a scene with her and McCarthy on a plane is hysterical. Miranda Hart is also terrific even though I initially thought her out of place but once she moved out into the field in the second half of the film I could not take my eyes off her and found that she stole scenes with great one liners or even just funny mannerisms. Jason Statham was perhaps not as funny as I was expecting but he was still great delivering his lines in a comically dead pan voice.The most plaudits must however go to Paul Feig for managing to create a film that was hilarious yet also riveting through its many plot twists and action sequences. His writing was so brilliantly specific to each character, something that only heightened the comedy. There were also many occasions during the film when lines became inaudible due to the laughter of myself and the audience at a previous line or action.",

I got more than a few belly laughs from Statham in particular, who is absolutely ridiculous in this movie in the best way possible. He's this oblivious tough guy who makes it a point to brag about how tough he is then does the dumbest things possible. McCarthy is back to being her hilarious self, and the supporting cast are all excellent. Spy is the definition of a fun action comedy - see it in theaters if possible because nothing's better than good laughs in a packed house.",

Also this movie movie makes use of its R rating they swear multiple times and some people get shot in the face and blood splatters. Everyone in this movie does a great job McCarthy, Jason Stathom, Rose Byrne, everyone! The Action Scenes were well shot. But my mine problem is that the plot is kinda cliche but its still kinda original but if you are really big into spy films then you've probably seen this. If you haven't seen Spy by now then please watch it whenever you get the time to.",

Smaller cast members; Miranda Hart, Peter Serafinowicz, and Allison Janney all contributed greatly to the movie. Melissa McCarthy has played many roles similar to this one, so if you want to see a different character from her, you will have to wait for her next film. McCarthy still delivers when she turns into filthy-mouthed intelligent badass after she has to become a spy for the CIA, because the entire group of spies have been discovered by the extremely ignorant villain, played by the beautiful Rose Byrne. McCarthy has to save the world from a nuclear bomb, and along the way she keeps you laughing and wondering what might come out of her mouth next, and of course if she will succeed in finding the bomb.",

'SPY' isn't your typical comedic movie, it's something that I, in my opinion, found original and funny in every way. It gives action, drama, crude humor that you will laugh no matter what, and a story that you've heard before but still give it a shot anyway because it's a f*cking spy movie. Say that James Bond had sex with Austin Powers and this is the results.",

This spy spoof excels in making a story for you to genuinely get into with some badass action to match, that somehow still manages to keep you laughing throughout. It's paced excellently, keeping the audience on a joy ride from the off; this is not only one of the best spy spoofs ever, it's one of the best comedies too",
