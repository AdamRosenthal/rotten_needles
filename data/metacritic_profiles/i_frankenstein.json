This movie is intended to be reimagining of the classic tale but there is still not anything revolutionary going on. I enjoyed the first two acts of this film it may not have been the story that I was looking for but there was some fun to be had. In the third act though, everything falls apart in just a few scenes and it completely drags on and when the time comes you are not invested in the ending at all. James McAvoy was really the reason I watched this film in the first place and he is great here but there is some pretty obvious overacting in spots. Radcliffe is pretty solid as well as he often is.",

Daniel Radcliffe gives an impressive performance as Igor, James McAvoy does a good job as the title character and Andrew Scott makes for a good antagonist. As I mentioned, I did have a few gripes- not all of the plot elements were entirely plausible and the only major female character in the movie does pretty much nothing for the plot. That said, there is still plenty to enjoy in the movie- McAvoy and Radcliffe had great chemistry and the production design was amazing. Overall, Victor Frankenstein may anger purists, but it's a fun movie that gives an iconic tale an intruiging twist. 7/10.",
