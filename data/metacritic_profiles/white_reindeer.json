Based on the trailer, the story is about a woman who's husband is violently killed just before Christmas.  Afterwards, she finds out that her husband had a brief affair with a stripper and the woman goes on a quest to find herself and more about the husband she thought she knew.  If that had been the movie, then we might have something.  Unfortunately, the remainder of the film is simply a series of segments where the woman indulges in extreme behavior (like excessive shopping, drugs, and sex parties) for no real reason other than they're just things most upscale family women don't do.",

Perhaps the jokes were so subtle I didn't realize they were supposed to be funny.  After a tragedy near the holidays, the eerily isolated main character makes a series of bad decisions.  Suzanne's character isn't really developed.  She is just sent reeling from one blow after another, reacting to each new humiliation.  If you really hate the Christmas season, this movie might compliment your mood.",
