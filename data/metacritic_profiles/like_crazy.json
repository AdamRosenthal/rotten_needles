My primary problem with the film is Jacob (Anton Yelchin) - he looks like he's loaded for about 80% of the film, and it's difficult for me to believe Anna (Felicity Jones), who seems to have her stuff together, would go for him in the first place.  But again, they're young, and we don't always get to pick that person.  I really like how the writer/director artfully skip huge chunks of cliche'd story that other movies have dealt with ad nauseum.  The type of ending employed seems to be in fashion these days. I don't have an issue with it, but I'm sure many probably do.  It seems Felicity Jones will be in the biz for the long haul - recently caught her in Chalet girl.

This made their relationship seem more real, it gave it a feel of authenticity. Great direction and story. Jennifer Lawrence was also really great. The only problem was the movie didn't really have any sense of time. I didn't know if 2 months or 1 year had passed, which made it a little hard to follow at what point in their relationship I was watching. But I think that might have been a deliberate choice by the director, I thought that he was trying to show that no matter how much time passes they will always be in love.

I think the way you ultimately feel about this story -- the ending in particular -- has much to do with what you project onto it, based upon your own experiences. I will say \"Like Crazy\" is an extremely apt title. It describes the swoon-worthy early stages of love ... yet also the painful, even damaging later stages where the urge to hold on and the desperate yearning to recapture can feel like (and possibly represent) a form of insanity. Extremely thoughtful, honest, well-calibrated performances by both leads and every supporting player. Just don't let the first act fool you -- this is NOT a feel-good movie throughout.",
