Mostly wondering.. can they pull this off even somewhat realistically?  There were a few disconnects in the story line but I forgave them for achieving the level of validity that they did considering  such a challenging yet compelling premise.  If you have ever wanted to attend your own funeral, at least watch the first half for a taste of what that might feel like in your worst nightmare.  ***Not a spoiler since it's in the trailer ***",
