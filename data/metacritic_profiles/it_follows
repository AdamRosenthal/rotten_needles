This is one of those gems. It's a beautifully shot, spare horror thriller with an amazing retro-analog synth score that keeps you tense and engaged throughout.  The basic premise and \"rules\" simple-yet-brilliant and lead to some highly fresh and fun terror sequences. Maika Monroe, fresh off her solid role in The Guest, raises her game with a stellar performance. And every one of the supporting actors, the setting, and the \"It\" are all so authentically drawn, you leave the theater with a smile on your face.

The sound in this film is what convinces me this film is a truly brilliant work. Yes, it is a great horror film on its own and is truly terrifying. The concept is fantastic and wonderously executed. Director David Robert Mitchell knows how to truly scare you and he does it with pure glee and abandon by keeping you on edge from the get go. The acting from Maika Monroe is great. The cinematography is also fantastic. However, none of this would be enough to make it as good as I believe it to be. Rather, the sound is what sets it above all other horror films that do everything else I mentioned very well. The sound is unsettling, creepy, terrifying, awe-inspiring, atmospheric, and other adjectives, to describe its true brilliance. It Follows is the best film of 2015.

By, the end of the movie it was one of the first times I've ever wanted a refund (not that I would ever ask) and somebody from the upper part of the theater behind me yelled out in disappointment as well and also mentioned rotten tomatoes.  It is slow paced and as with most horror movies had many just plain stupid and easily avoidable situations.  The characters just seemed cliched(not such a surprise, as many movies borrow from others) as far as I.Q.s under 100 and casually not believing anything that was transpiring.  The only plus was that the idea of the movie was somewhat original.  I do stress somewhat.  Then, in the blink of an eye, it ended in the type of way you ask yourself \"Seriously?

These and many other ordinary compositions have been lit and captured in a way that gives the film its eerie sense of menace and dread. In the main the film owes its success to these simple details masterfully directed by David Robert Mitchell. Maika Monroe, looking very much like Chloe Sevigny, registers strongly as the young victim of events, and the nerve jangling score is another great contributor. It is also good to be able to report that the film does not rely on gimmicky shock tactics to raise the hairs on your neck. In fact, there are surprisingly few jumps to be had. Still, this doesn't prevent the film from holding you mesmerised in the palm of its hand for almost its entire running time or, at least, until an unsatisfactory ending somewhat disappoints.",

It Follows is a rarity among modern horror - it's unique and spells out very little for the audience by focusing entirely on eerie atmosphere and constant suspense. The brilliant musical score elevates the film and provides a retro feel similar to John Carpenter's Halloween. That comparison alone speaks volumes about newcomer director David Robert Mitchell who, along with Jennifer Kent (The Babadook), are breathing fresh life into a struggling genre. They are directors to keep your eyes on in the upcoming years.",

This film takes a lot of elements from A Nightmare on Elm Street. For example, you'll see a female lead struggling to sleep through fear, you'll see skin bruises caused by an invisible monster, you'll see a group of teenagers dealing with the monster, while none of the parents appear to be involved, also they take a scene straight out of the movie when the female lead tries to call her friend (who happens to look a little like Johnny Depp) across the street through her bedroom window at nighttime to warn him about the monster before he dies in his bedroom... There are still a ton of original ideas in this film, but this just stood out while I watched the film. Really good film, but I wouldn't consider it a masterpiece. Still way better than all the other crap horror films that come out annually.",

The movie just drags on for what seems like forever after an admittedly intriguing opening, only to devolve into shots that go on for way, WAY too long that focus on nothing of real significance, little is explained as to what \"it\" is, why \"it\" follows, why \"it\" is at times unable to open a door, which \"it\" then resorts to breaking windows, then is able to hurl large electronics into a swimming pool and take on a completely different level of physicality that makes you question what the hell it's actually capable of. That's how a lot of the movie is: something is vaguely eluded to and you think you know the 'rules', because as an audience, we're being told a story and we want to feel like we have a personal stake in the film, feel a little immersion, etcetera. But little to nothing is ever explained. Characters are just not interesting. Jay's sister seems to be there to be a shoulder to cry on in close ups when things \"get crazy\" and doesn't really have an arc to her story at all. There's another girl with glasses and a \"shell phone\" in the group that provides almost nothing other than famous quotes delivered in a monotonous, pretentious tone of voice during low points, just to keep it's floundering head above water in hopes that the audience will put up with just a little more punishment.",

Adam Wingard (You\u2019re Next, The Guest) and Gerard Johnstone (Housebound) have put their knowledge of modern horror to use, creating genre-inverting horror comedies that manage the tricky task of being funny without diminishing the scares. Even more promising is the work of Jennifer Kent (The Babadook) and Ben Wheatley (Kill List, A Field in England) who draw on the history of film to move the medium forward. Both groups are similar in that they are film literate but the distinction of where they are pulling references from is important. We have seen a few films in the first group enter the mainstream consciousness (Scream, Cabin in the Woods) but none that I can think of from the latter (maybe studio\u2019s think they are doing this by remaking classic horrors?). It Follows, the sophomore effort from writer/director David Robert Mitchell falls decidedly in the latter group. Harking back to the films of John Carpenter without feeling derivative, It Follows is a statement of how far Horror has come, and the promising future it might have.",

In fact, theres very little mention of time(or even temporal continuity editing throughout the film), all the while slowly revealing that the reason for much of this midwestern mise-en-cene is that the film is set in suburban Detroit in the late Summer(something that with my regional prejudices seemed to be a horrific revelation in and of itself) .",

If you enjoy warped video, panning video of nothing, video of people do people things (brushing teeth, staring at things, ect...), then this is the movie for you. Of course, it must be added, the vast majority of the film that isn't panning shots of nothing, are shots of porno magazines and nudity for the sake of nudity. There is nothing artistic about the way they show nudity. All together, this film is an example of a modern era, where anyone with a camera can think themselves capable of releasing a film. I cannot say it strongly enough, DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM. There is nothing good about this film. I can not understand why the reviews put this film in such high esteem. A zero is too good a score for this atrocity of a film. DO NOT WATCH.",

It was incredibly well acted, and so many of the shots were beautiful--just the camera panning slowly across a quiet suburban street.  I found it really interesting that they managed to anonymize the time period to such a degree--I've spoken to people who think it took place in the future (because of the clam shell ereader), and ones who think it took place in the past because all the other electronics look so old and dated.  I think the overall effect is to set it in any time period, which is also perhaps why it was so hard to tell where it was taking place until near the end.  The premise was so simple and startling and the result is an excellent movie.  I'm so glad that it received wide distribution and that I got to see it, and be scared by it.",

      "text": "It you have seen the Trailer or read any of the glowing accolades there are no possible spoilers left. But, for the sake of sparing those who have remained objective about the return of body horror I will check the appropriate box. It Follows has a beautifully stunning aesthetic that recalls the photography of Gregory Crewdson's Twilight (surreal suburban imagery) or the cinematography from Les Revenants (The Returned) where everything is shot in a crepuscular glow. But, if we were to combine urban legends about waking up and finding \"welcome to the wonderful world of AIDS\" scrawled on your mirror after a one-night stand with the curse from either version of the Ring you would have It Follows. An interesting premise that sounds preposterous when you can sum it up as a \"sexually transmitted curse.\" Although the movie does not rely on jump scares or soundtrack manipulation it does not employ character development or dialogue either. Also the slowly walking dead who are invisible to anyone not initiated into the sex curse are easy to evade despite being relentless and perpetually changing appearance, so suspense builds only when the audience can see the murderous zombies walking up behind her and the main character is otherwise distracted.  We witness her slowly unraveling as she struggles to save herself by passing the curse on to others, if the ethical dilemma had been more pronounced maybe it would have generated suspense but because she eventually does doom her younger sister's crush and a boat of horny boys only to find that the zombies still seek her out because these others have already been killed. Still, the only thing I find remarkable about the movie is the level of disconnect between adults and the teenagers, the media seems unfazed by the initial rape, the inexplicable and violent death of teenagers and that a group of friends are breaking into a pool with a series of electronic devices. It is supposed to have a nightmarish surreal quality but in a world where are consequences are suspended it is hard to fear whatever it is that follows.",

      "text": "A truly masterful psychological horror film. I haven't stopped thinking about it since I watched it a few days ago. Though there were two scenes that I felt were unnecessary and slightly confusing (where 'it' attacks Jay at the beach and when it appears on the roof of her house), the majority of the film is both shot and written ingeniously. I loved how it didn't completely rely on jumpscares, and the scariest scenes in the film were definitely the ones that were built up for a while and gave a sense of dread, rather than a sudden instrumental thud. I thought the cinematography was very impressive, but the thing that stood out the most to me was the writing. Unlike a lot of mainstream hollywood horror films that like to show all of the gory details, a lot of the events in It Follows are implied. A lot of the time you're left to notice subtle visual cues that indicate what just happened off screen. This clever type of storytelling is precisely what we need more of, not just in horror films, but all types of films right now. Other aspects of the film that we aren't shown have been left to interpretation. After watching many YouTube videos analysing the film, there are loads of valid ideas as to what the film may be a metaphor for and what the ending means. In my opinion, the way significant parts of this film are left to interpretation rather than spelled out for the audience is part of what makes it so brilliant, and as a result It Follows has crawled under my skin as I've spent days coming up with my own explanation for the film's dark meaning. In conclusion, easily the best horror film I've seen in years. I'm very impressed that a horror film in recent years has managed to genuinely scare me.",

The film really wasn't that scary though which I was disappointed by and I found the story kind of tampered off during the third act after an amazing second act, despite a few flaws I enjoyed It Follows and I'd love to see David Robert Mitchell at the helm for another horror film, lets see a Stephen King adaption next.

The praise to mainly come from the idea a of it being a \"smart movie\" when in reality I picked up on something. There was a point where it felt like the movie and I were going for a jog right after a well deserved break. I felt refreshed and ready to go but once you hit the midway point I began to feel like I had done this all before. The movie plays off of paranoia which fades quickly once it has ended however it still felt like there was some sort of voice growing louder from the other side of the screen. After clearing my ears from all of the nostalgia I could finally make out the words \"remember when this clich\u00e9 used to be cool\" on loop for the remainder of the film. It then quickly turned from horror to thriller where the scares were non-existent but adrenaline was still going through me. The only thing which I can say was amazing about the film was the actors due to the realism being portrayed through them. Sadly everything else seemed like a cut out from a better movie. The pacing was confusing as I had to keep checking my watch to see if I hadn't zoned out for the last 10 minutes as I had felt like a coffee break whilst an entity who constantly follows you was out of place. The entity itself would have been creepy if I hadn't had been through something that is terrorising films since last year and that is the \"new movie trailer\". Now for the people that don't know the \"new movie trailer\" is when the person in charge of making a trailer for a movie is given the footage but is told not the watch it at all. They then put what ever they can fit in the 1-4 minute trailer without realising they ruined the movie's biggest spoiler. The trailer of \"It Follows\" shows every form of the entity besides from one that wasn't worth putting in anyway. In the end I would label \"It Follows\" as a thriller rather than a horror which was disappointing. I loved the plot and the characters however when a movie has so many rules to stick to which it made it self something is bound to go wrong. It was a one watch kind of movie due to it starting well but it went other a cliff after in the last act.",

The soundtrack is amazing though! Also what seems weak is the story-line as in how it plays out; like for one the monster just being some random person you might love is interesting but not scary at all. I like the shot where \"it\" comes out at 1:41 (check trailer on YT) and i think if the monster took that form or maybe took forms of other people but when it took their form they were say mutated or human but still kinda not. Also the monster idea is amazing as most horror are generic but this isn't same as the monster its very creative, but the way they used the monster and how they showed \"it\" and how the characters and story plays out makes \"it\" not as terrifying but more interesting and eerie. It'd be cool if they made a sequel that had better writing,scripting,budget,actors,and a little more of everything (expect the soundtrack) than it probably be the best horror movie ever!!! i give this version a 5 out of 10.

The acting is good for the most part. The lead (Maika Monroe) is great in the movie. The best part of this movie is the atmosphere it creates. The unnerving electronic music and the beautiful and eerie wide-shots create a great atmosphere, which causes you to constantly feel slightly on edge throughout the movie, nervously searching the screen for \"It\". The pacing is good overall, but the movie starts to drag a bit in the middle. The pool scene had a few plot holes (as well as some of the decisions the characters made), but was quite intense nonetheless. An issue I had with this movie is the rules of \"It\". It is described to only walk slowly towards the person who has \"it\". Yet at times, \"It\" can crush windows, open doors, swim, jump, stand still, and other stuff. This movie gets the good score it gets for the acting by the lead, the cinematography, music and score, and as well the story. It does not quite reach the \"masterpiece\" level for the inconsistencies of \"it\", the draggy middle and a few plot holes. This movie is flawed, but overall very good and has great atmosphere.",

While it created some tension, most opportunities were wasted and not followed up by anything remotely scary.  I wasn't remotely frightened at any point.  There are some parts that don't belong and seem as if it was accidentally put in and forgot about by the director.  The 30 extra seconds tacked onto every scene was unnecessary and made me physically frustrated as I felt a 10 year old boy with disabilities would know not to put in.  The movie could not establish a time period to save it's life as it jumped from old tv's and black and white shows to a 2007 Ford Explorer.  The one special effect in the movie looked as if it was from sharknado and belongs on syfy.  I don't know what movie many other reviewers watched as apposed to what movie I watched but it wasn't good and I recommend to not waste your money on it.  It was a terrible movie and the trailers were highly misleading as to how scary it would actually be.  I felt bad wasting 6 dollars on it, none the less movie theater price.  So if you want unnecessary elderly nudity and nonsensical writing, look no further than this movie.  I'd also like to add why people should take this review seriously and to that I would say that I made an account just to share my feelings about this movie.

However, It Follows left me with nothing. No sense of dread, I was never creeped out, freaked out, or the least bit afraid. And when the dead victims, ghosts, cursed, w/e, appeared, it was nowhere near as effective as how M. Night Shyamalan pulled it off in The Sixth Sense. I\u2019m not necessarily suggesting skipping It Follows, but if you never end up seeing this movie, you\u2019re not missing out on much.",

      "text": "Alright here's what I have to say about this load of garbage. Why don't we start off with the main character, shes a whore she sleeps with 3 men in the same movie and this is in a span of like 5 days! But that's ok right? Wrong, it's like the movie try's to be bad I mean like the beginning is so slow, wait scratch that the whole **** movie is. I didn't really understand the whole movie to be honest, they had a lot of **** that they wasn't necessary like at the beginning because the girl got her leg bent backwards, but when the ghost got the other dude all that happened was he got raped and died, this **** doesn't make any sense the movie breaks its own rules, an example of this **** is almost the whole **** movie. The ghost is suppose to be slow and only walk, well it shows the main character n friends driving a lot and I mean a lot. You would think that at least out of one of their driving sequences one of them would be a road trip maybe a couple of hours away. But guess what? The ghost shows up in a matter of hours, now unless the movie had a time skip or something then the ghost shouldn't have been able to make it there in a couple of hours. But even if they did have a time skip we were never informed of this they could have been like (A couple of days later or some **** like that) but no there was nothing .The plot is really weak honestly, its about a slut who catches a ghost kinda like a one way STD and if the ghost touches you I guess (I don't really know since the movie doesn't follow its own rules) then you die? yeah it likes to change the rules. Also, why didn't she just take an air plane far away then **** some random dude, it could have been solved so easy but they had to make all this bull **** I can tell you the whole movie with a couple of sentences wanna hear? Alright, Main Char ****s a dude, then she see's a ghost, she runs away from the ghost, ghosts follows her and breaks something, try's to solve it, can't, ****s another guy then repeat this one more time and you have the whole movie right there. Don't believe me? Then why don't you go watch it for yourself because I'm being 100% honest to walahi swear to god that that's all that happens with a few little minor tweaks. I also feel that the character development was weak. All her friends were the stupidest bunch ever and they didn't do much except sit on their lazy ass or they were sleeping. The middle of the movie was just plain boring and there was little to no suspense at all no rising action what so ever just run away from the ghost. The ending of the movie was the stupidest part though. Even after the main char tried to shoot the ghosts face off they decide it would be a good idea to hide in a ONE ENTRANCE AND EXIT POOL! HAHAHAHA what dumb asses, anyways... They put electrical things like toasters and hair dryers around the pool then they put the main char in the pool, My guess is as good as yours that they were trying to kill the ghost in the pool after the girl gets out, and do you think that works? Of course not you dingus, The ghost isn't a retard it doesn't **** around dog it just picks up the **** and starts throwing it at the main char. This is when the dumb ass shoots their friend trying to shoot the ghost that he can't see, buddie please tell me what exactly you're trying to accomplish? I'll just make it quick cause I wanna get to the ending. They put a blanket on the ghost, Point blank it, ghost falls in water, main char swims away from it (another time the movie breaks it's own rules (ghost catches up with the main char swimming as fast as possible)), guy shoots ghost trying to drown main char ghost dies?, main char see's blood in the pool. Great, Perfect, Happy end, NOTTT!!! lets just say it like this. The girl ****s for the third time now THIRD TIME so that guy has the ghost, then he drives past 2 hookers (not sure what he does quite honestly there was never any hint or clue that he ****ed them just drove past) then main char and **** are walking down a side walk you can see someone following them in the distance (The rape ghost) thus ending the movie. Please no squeal. Do i recommend it? NO. Is it scary? NO. I am ashamed of this disgrace of a movie and i want my 1 hour and 40 mins back, your worst enemy's don't deserve this torture. So if you can, Please please please stay away from this movie.",

The visuals were striking, the sound was gripping, and the premise was interesting and relatively well handled. There are a few images in particular which left a very strong impression on me. Honestly, this was the first horror movie I've seen in quite a while which actually impeded my sleep. It is not without its issues, but I would recommend this movie to anyone who isn't diametrically opposed to horror films. Unlike The Babadook, which has been hyped beyond any reasonable expectation, It Follows proves that the genre is not flawed at its core, but in its general execution.",

And in the end it's got a plotline you could lift from nearly any monster movie, as the creature is defeated (or IS IT?) and the Unlucky Everydude saves the pretty girl. My only hope is that the critical success of this movie will open the door to more daring efforts in the fields of cerebral horror and monster flicks.",
