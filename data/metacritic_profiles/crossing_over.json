I watched the movie for class and we were only showed a few parts of the entire movie but from what I saw i enjoyed and it made me curious to see in it its entirety to truly understand it all. I would say that the movie is decent but not blow your socks off amazing. If you want a movie that jumps around a bit and makes you think, this will do it.",
