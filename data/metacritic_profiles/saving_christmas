Normally I'd bash the terrible comedy, bad camerawork and lame script (trust me, I still hate them.), but it's the message in this movie that makes me want to attack Mr Cameron with a sharpened candy cane. The fact that there's apparently a 'wrong way' to look at Christmas is just narrow-minded and borderline offensive. What if we don't want to treat Christmas like the greatest day ever? What if we don't want to ignore the bad parts? I always saw Christmas as a season of mixed feelings personally. A confusing time where we don't always know how to feel. The Charlie Brown Christmas Special absolutely nailed this message and that was made in 1965. A good 49 YEARS EARLIER! Y'know an article on Kirk Cameron's website said that Atheism is founded on fear and prejudice. After watching this, I believe I've found a greater source of fear and prejudice. Fear that rational minded people are finding entirely logical flaws in your holiday and using prejudice to force them to change their ways. Please Please PLEASE do not watch this movie!",
