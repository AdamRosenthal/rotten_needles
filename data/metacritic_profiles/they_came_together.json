It's very bizarre, but if you know what to expect, it is very funny.  I laughed out loud many times...and also yelled things like \"what the hell?!?\" at the TV several times because weird things kept happening that wouldn't in real life with real people.  Characters break the fourth wall making it hard to believe that the characters are real people, so empathy is difficult, so this movie is mainly just for the laughs.  It has a fantastic cast with more familiar faces than I could name.  Throughout the whole thing, I kept thinking \"This really reminds me a lot of Wet Hot American Summer.\" Afterwards, I looked it up, and yep, I was right, same writer and director....partially the same cast (with lots of other people we all know from assorted sitcoms showing up.)

This movie is trying to be a parody of cheesy romance movies but while it is overly cheesy none of it leads to great comedy or satire of the genre and the cheesiness hurts the movie more than it helps it resulting in a movie that is even worse than the films it is trying to satirize. But the biggest sin this movie has made is its lack of lasting appeal. This movie is bland and forgettable with nothing memorable about it. For all the bad movies (specifically comedies like Movie 43) I\u2019ve seen some of them were memorable and even if its for the wrong reasons I still remember them and their **** This movie on the other hand has none of that.

Director David Wain's script is funny and a little tiresome, but the chemistry between the leads is a droll. Grade A-",

And like Airplane it's not afraid to throw out other bizarre non-sequiturs jokes as well. Just when you think it's settled down, it throws another punch out of the blue.  This movie deserves to be a cult classic, but I wish it was better received so other movies would learn from it... instead we'll no doubt end up with another ______ Movie in the next six months instead.",

      "text": "They Came Together is a delightfully smart romantic comedy filled with absurdity and incredibly dry humour. The story is unsure whether it is a parody or pastiche film, and at some times it is a bit messy. Just remember that this film is meant to be a parody of films like You've Got Mail, nothing more. The supporting cast is not used to their potential, particularly Bill Hader and Ellie Kemper, but the chemistry of Paul Rudd and Amy Poelher bring this cliched film literally to higher levels of entertainment. Definitely a very intelligent and enjoyable comedy.",
