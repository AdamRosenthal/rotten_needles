I don't usually disagree vehemently with the roster of professional critics, but with this movie, I am baffled by the low scores. Paul Rudd and Tina Fey are wonderful, the script is delightful, and puts the viewer a little off balance, keeping the surprise element  always in play. We don't like predictable scripts, and this was far from it; two original characters, who travel a wonderfully circuitous path toward the \"happy ending.\" This movie was one of our favorites of the year. We're so tired of the mega-violent and teen-angst flicks that Hollywood is perpetually foisting on the public. It was so refreshing to go to the movies and laugh, smile, empathize, and simply dream along with the lead characters. This review wouldn't be complete without a tip of the hat to Lily Tomlin, who puts in a stellar performance, playing Tina Fey's stridently feminist author mother. Wonderful! Please go see this movie, and take your friends and family. You will be thankful that you did.",

The likable Tina Fey and Paul Rudd did play the parts well, and I found myself liking their characters and wanting more. But, there shall be no Admission 2. In summation, this movie felt like an Apatow-directed jumble of emotion, drama, and comedy, and sometimes it didn't know where it was going. If the foundation had been stronger, this movie would not have suffered so much.
