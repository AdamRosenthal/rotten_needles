The only new movie that had any interest, more because of the actors than the subject, was \u201cPhantom\u201d, which is based on a true story about a Russian  submarine in 1968 planning to fire on a U. S. ship hoping to start World War 3 between China and the U. S. their biggest competitors. We were the only 2 people in the auditorium so it was like a private showing but that didn\u2019t help much. It is a comparatively short movie--97 minutes--covering a lot but making it a little hard to figure out what was going on. At one point I thought one of the actors had been killed and there he was in the next scene, though in profile, and Allen had to tell me it was him. None of the actors use a Russian accent which is a blessing especially when it comes to scientific angles of what is going on. There are some flashbacks which aren\u2019t clearly edited and neither is the ending. The director/screenwriter, Todd Robinson, isn\u2019t exactly clear on what is happening when, or why, but most of the actors come through for him with Ed Harris doing the best job. David Duchovny seems out of place, not quite comfortable playing the KGB agent. The supporting cast is made up of many familiar faces who always give their all including William Fichter, Jason Beghe, Sean Patrick Flanery, Johnathon Schaech, Lance Henriksen and Julian Adams. They are actors that you will constantly ask yourself, \u201cI know them but from where?\u201d and are interesting to watch. Dagmara Dominczyk and Tessa Robinson play brief roles. In no way is \u201cPhantom\u201d in the same class as \u201cDas Boots\u201d  \u201cRun Silent, Run Deep\u201d or \u201cThe Hunt For Red October\u201d but I have a feeling it is a better movie than the other ones that opened today",
