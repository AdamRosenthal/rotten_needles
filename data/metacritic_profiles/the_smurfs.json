I'm not saying that I hate them, on the contrary, I used to like the smurfs when I was a kid. I don't understand why they brought them back. It just ruins the reputation of the smurfs. The people who would be interested to see this are little kids, which surprisingly makes a good family movie. It wasn't that bad. This got to be the movie that surprised me the most this year. Of course, there are some flaws. It has '' cheesy '' humor, the villain Gargamel (played by Hank Azaria) was stupid and has other '' cliche '' stuff that you would expect. This kind of entertainment is useless and annoying these days. Hollywood producers, directors or whatever, should stop making these type of movies. Also, has you probably already know, Katy Perry does the voice of Smurfette. She actually did a good job. But it starting to get on my nerves to see singers appearing in movies (it's okay if they can actually act), leave that to the actors. Anyway, I saw this movie with my little brother, and he liked it. So this movie may be enjoyable for kids, even I surprisingly thought it was better then I expected. At some points, I even managed to get entertained a bit.",

What we got in the end was an insulting child racist poorly done, lazy Smurfs movie, and its not worth your money even if you were to see it free. Let me explain why it failed so badly. It starts off in the Smurfs village until they are teleported into the city of New York for some lazy unexplained reason this completely breaks the nostalgia of the Smurf village making the viewers feel out of their comfort zone. Even worse The smurfs tv show was set in the middle ages and for some reason this movie is taking place in the 20 century, it goes against the tv episodes. A few of the Smurf, not all, sadly try to find a place to stay amongst the humans in New York, but because the story is so so poorly told  it feels like its going another direction for no reason at all. Its basically a weak story when the Smurfs are trying to get home in between that time waiting for the portal to reappear the events that occur are so dull and mind numbingly out of place. I didn't feel any connection with the Smurfs and what they were trying to accomplish, and so therefore didn't care what was going to happen to the Smurfs in the end. It makes it even worse that the movie does try to make us care about the Smurf, with only some dull emotional scenes, shoe horned in. By the way the voice acting was awful, especially with the Smurfs. The tv show had likeable characters with quirky and unique personalities, and lots of humor. But in the movie we find ourselves with boring characters and terrible writing and there was humor which was terrible and didn't make me laugh once, not even once, in fact the humor was annoying. The acting is horrible, probably one of the worse acting movies ever, and not just with the actors but with the animation. So what you have here is a boring, shallow and uninspiring disgrace to the Smurfs tv show. Don't watch this movie, and don't support it in anyway possible, and tell everyone to stay away from it. If you have children and thinking of sharing the movie with them, don't take them to see this movie. Especially for your children, we don't need horror like this to torment their innocent minds. If you want to experience the Smurfs franchise then watch the tv episodes of the Smurfs, you wont regret it.",

Sure, it was a big part of the TV show as well, but we as a culture have moved on from that kind of entertainment.

Anyway, the film is just awful. There is nothing positive about it. It uses pathetic acting (mainly Gargamel and Sofia Vergara who is playing Gloria from \"Modern Family\" basically - or is she just playing Sofia Vergara?), horrible screenplay - the dialogue is pathetic - and it is just not very funny. There is something to be said about a film in which a character makes fun of \"how annoying\" the theme song is. The sad thing is - the song is very annoying (at least in the rendition in the film), as is the whole picture.

      "text": "Hot on the trail of the Smurfs, the wizard has no time for introspection, especially in such a faraway land as New York City. He almost had them, but once again, the little blue creatures were able to outsmart their age-old enemy, escaping this time in \"a mechanical wagon\"(taxi), by the seat of their white pants. For the moment, while Gargamel figures out the logistics of corralling his most hated nemeses, the wizened old necromancer can bide some time, thanks to the fortuitous hairball that Azarel coughs up. Entangled in the cat's mucus, to the wizard's chagrin, are strands of Smurfette's hair, the color of which is not what Gargamel had selected for the girl's coif the day that he created her. In \"The Smurfette\", an origin story of the patriarchal village's only female member(an episode from the NBC animate series \"The Smurfs\"), we learn that Smurfette started out as a brunette, a Jew, just like her father, who resembles a caricature born out of German propaganda, the bogeyman that Goethke makes the Judaic people out to be, for the benefit of a roomful of terrified Hitler youths, in \"Europa, Europa\", by describing the Hebrew people as having a \"high forehead\", \"shifty eyes\", and an \"apelike walk\", characteristics that aptly describe Gargamel's somewhat grotesque figure. In \"The Smurfette\", the wizard makes \"exaggerated gestures\", going so far as \"waving his hands around in excitement\" over the \"Blue Bride of Gargamel,\" giving credence to Goethke's lies about the persecuted people whom Salomon Perel, known to his Nazi teacher and peers as \"Jupp Peters\", actually descends from, in the 1990 film about the arbitrary nature of identity, and survival during the Holocaust. \"Garbage Smell\"(referred as such in the movie) is the imaginary Jew who \"leaps at your throat\", which Goethke, on bended knee, demonstrates by squeezing a student's neck, seated at his desk, the resulting consequence of what happens \"the minute your back is turned\". Goethke, the master of spurious impersonations, in that moment, is a forerunner to Gargamel, a live-action cartoon figure made real through agitprop rhetoric and hateful hate. In \"The Smurfs\", Gargamel finds himself in a city where he wouldn't be touched by self-loathing, since back home, there's not another Jew to be found in the forest, whereas in the \"Big Apple\"(while creating Smurfette, he describes her as being \"three apples high\"), the lonely wizard, for the first time in his life, would be among his own kind, because down deep inside, he wants to be a Smurf(read: Aryan), too. \"The Smurfette\" is telling. From a blue lump of clay, the Smurf alchemy that Gargamel performs is indicative of the wizard's deep inferiority complex at the hands of Papa Smurf, who has the cult of personality to rule 99, whereas his autocratic influence holds sway over a single mangy cat. Broken down at the elemental level, Smurfette is made out of \"sugar and spice(but nothing nice)\", \"a dram of crocodile tears\", \"half a packet of lies\", and \"the hardest stone for a heart\", an ingredient list that seems to have been written out by an Aryan. To Gargamel, the Smurfette is a sort of wish-fulfillment; he gets to live vicariously through her, because being blue is what he most wishes for. In \"Europa, Europa\", Goethke considers the Nordic race as the gems of the earth, championing light hair and blue eyes as being \"the most glowing example of creation\". Likewise, Papa Smurf, as a result of sharing the same Nazi ideology, transforms the slightly dowdy, black-haired Smurfette into a terrifying vision of Aryan perfection, introducing the finished produced as being \"new and improved\", meaning that she is blonde and Nordic-looking. Salomon, in his effort to be more Aryan-like, reattaches the foreskin to his circumcised penis. Presumed to be East Baltic, \"Jupp\" is barely Aryan as is, therefore, barely human, similar to how Smurfette's new family of blue Aryan youth considers her to be barely a Smurf, due to the girl's naturally dark hair. But for survival's sake, she seduces her blue enemy by acting the part of the coquette, just like Charlotte Rampling in \"The Night Porter, where the concentration camper sings a song made famous by Marlene Dietrich(star of \"The Blue Angel\"), while dancing topless with Nazi accouterments. Since blue is white in the Enchanted Forest, the blue moon ad that Patrick Winslow creates and Odilie approves for her cosmetics company, becomes an accidental endorsement for Aryan superiority, or rather, blue superiority, without their knowledge. Papa Smurf needs Gargamel; the totalitarian needs the wizard in order to keep himself in power. In all likelihood, he created the Jewish bogeyman, similar to how the elders in \"The Village\" invented the myth of the monster in the woods as a scare tactic against their people leaving. Papa needs his minions. Those smurfberries aren't going to pick themselves.",

I got to give the film some credit that they at least tried to make this movie heartwarming and fun. The Smurfs universe looks awesome, though you only see it for less than 15 minutes, while everything else is in New York City. There were many useless scenes, really corny humour and the ending was all cut and paste that ended too quickly. The only thing I liked about The Smurfs was Gargamel (played by Hank Azaria) and Azrael (voiced by Frank Welker). Those two practically got me entertained than the rest of the cast, even though some dumb and repetitive jokes felt pretty forced from those villains. The Smurfs is a film I will definitely skip. It's bad, but not extremely terrible.",

They look pretty real, and really have spot-on voices, especially Katy Perry as Smurfette. The story is familiar but I'd prefer it over an adventure with Gargamel as the only human.
