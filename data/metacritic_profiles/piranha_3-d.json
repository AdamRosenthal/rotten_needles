It plays up the jiggle sex to the hilt, but it also has a heart courtesy of Elizabeth Shue and her screen family.  Ving Rhames is awesome in a limited role, and Christopher Lloyd is at his Back To The Future best.  But the money shots - the scenes of blood-and-gutsy gore are incredible.  Picture a girl's hair getting caught in a motorboat's propeller while a panicking teenager  in the boat tries to get the motor re-started. What comes of that scene will be stuck in my head for at least the night. But not what you would expect, mind you. It's a funny, funny movie.",

It's pure exploitation trash, but it nails it with deadly precision. Alexandre Aja has gleefully crafted a film so horrendously grisly and stupid, that to enter the film with tongue planted in-cheek is a basic requirement. \"Piranha 3D\", like Sam Raimi's recent \"Drag Me to Hell\", are not meant to be taken seriously, and would fall under the \"comedy horror\" category. However, the former contains gallons upon gallons more blood, and mutilations that would make any horror geek squirm.

The main character is dull , his mother is ok but the rest of the cast ( Except for the Kelly Brook which is obviosly there for the eye candy moments) are quite irritant. There is a certain grindhouse feel in the movie which is also a plus but that's individual impression. CGI Pirahna's dont look so good at all , and their real potential is probably only there when watching in 3d. This is a rolecoaster ride first , and a good horror movie second which is a bad for Director who staretd with Heute Tension , and Hill have eyes remake. This movie is his downhill , that he started with Mirrors , but that doesnt mean audiences wont enjoy it. Fun and cheap.",

      "text": "Kelly goes wild, just not wild enough to get herself killed, or rather, punished by the filmmaker. The \"good girl\" may down a jigger of tequila, lick salt off the bare skin of a bad girl, then suck face and suck lime like a pro, but the good girl, despite her trampy conduct, does keep her top on. This is how we know she'll survive the Grand Guignol spectacle of the \"Saving Private Ryan\"/\"The Real Cancun\" mash-up that turns out to have a surprisingly feminist bent. Don't be distracted by all the blood and breasts, and more importantly, don't make snap judgements about the film's graphic violence and liberal dose of nudity; don't be fooled. The filmmaker has bigger fish to fry. This is hardly an empty-minded exploitation movie about the worst spring break ever. \"Piranha 3D\" serves as a critique on pornography; it shows how pornography works. Jerry O'Connell plays Derrick Jones, a soft-core pornographer(clearly modeled after Joe Francis of \"Girls Gone Wild\" infamy) who preys on young nubiles with the hope of getting them drunk, then naked, for his \"movies\". Against Jake's protestations, Kelly gets on his yacht, where she performs for the camera, but not until Derrick needles her a bit. When the piranhas go wild, the filmmaker makes a salient point about pornography's function, as bare-breasted women are literally turned into meat, slashed and severed, for the instant gratification of the fish(read: pornography's consumers). Initially, the nudity is pleasurable(great faces, great racks), since by all appearances, it's the women's choice to be nude, but when the violence starts to intervene on sex's behalf, the film suggests that appearances can be deceiving. After all, it's usually a man who holds the camera. As it turns out, the prehistoric fish are not old enough to spawn, so when Derrick's detached genitalia becomes fish food that one of the baby piranhas spits out, the filmmaker demonstrates the relationship between pornography and kids, who just aren't ready for D-cups, and C-cups, and etc. etc. etc. Ultimately, \"Piranha 3D\" indicts the audience, indicts them on the charge of being hypocrites for cheering on Derrick's appropriate manner of demise, since porn is a ten-billion dollar business. Pornography keeps the world spinning.",

I gave \"Date Night\" a zero since it did not have a single laugh. I hasten to post concerning \"Piranha\" in the hope that I may deter any additional movie-goers from seeing it. I shamelessly take comments from the critics, often out of their context, to identify exactly what I think about this movie: \"sick,\" \"exploitation,\" \"stupefying,\" \"schlock,\" \"disgusting,\" \"sick,\" \"gross-out,\" \"shameless,\" \"trash,\" \"ridiculous,\" \"gratuitous.\" This movie is mind-numbingly bad. It has no wit, no satire, no point other than to display females in various degrees of undress. If CGI boobs are your thing, \"Piranha\" has plenty of them for you. It is bad in every way -- plot, acting, script. It has gore, senseless, overwhelming, and near-eternal in duration. Save yourself the price of admission and two hours of your life, and do not go!",

      "text": "Somewhere near the end of Piranha 3D, as Ving Rhames was indiscriminately firing shotgun casings into the water and Jerry O\u2019Connell was doing tequila shots off an eighty-five percent naked woman, I decided to award this film three stars. This may seem like an unusually high number of stars for a gimmicky b-movie about piranhas attacking drunk college kids in the third dimension, but I happen to find a certain amount of honor in a film delivering exactly upon its promises. Four stars, that would be ludicrous and two stars, that would imply Piranha 3D somehow disappointed. But three stars, that\u2019s the right number for an aggressively pleasurable film involving cocaine, piranhas, inordinate amounts of nudity and Jerry O\u2019Connell.  Sheriff Julie Forester (Elisabeth Shue) is a single mother in charge of the waters surrounding Lake Victoria, a seemingly quiet Arizona town annually invaded by throngs of douche bags and whores every Spring Break. Julie puts her seventeen year old son Jake (Steven R. McQueen) in charge of watching his two little siblings so she can skim the waters for, I guess vomit, but this Babysitting Diaries plan goes awry almost immediately. There are three problems. 1) An underwater earthquake has opened up a subterranean portal, releasing swarms of cannibalistic piranhas. 2) Porn producer Jerry O\u2019Connell has enlisted her son as an impromptu location scout for his newest seedy film. 3) Nanny McPhee had a previous engagement, returning, somewhere else. Piranhas, like mastadons, like wildebeests and sometimes like boozed-up college kids on spring break, are ludicrous pack-traveling creatures who seem to lack long-term goals. They exist only in the moment to satisfy the most basic of human or creature desires. This strikes me as a bad strategy for planning one\u2019s retirement but a totally reasonable way to spend a Saturday night. I fear the majority of reviewers will disagree with me, but fu*k them. Movies are about creating a story and telling said story in an entertaining or enlightening way. Never has a movie so overtly claimed to be about something and then been about that exact same something. Here are three facts about Piranha 3D: 1) A piranha tears a woman\u2019s swimsuit top off. 2) Adam Scott rides around in a jet ski pretending to be Rambo. 3) I will likely buy it on sale some time late next year for between $6.99 and $8.99. If any of those hot facts made you roll your eyes, there are four other new releases opening in theaters this week for you to see.",

There is Richard Dreyfuss in a cameo roll singing \"Show me the way to go home\", the poster has a girl on top of the water with a bunch of piranhas right below her, and there is also the inevitable argument that \"we cannot close the beach now, this community needs the money!\"  Remember how Samuel L. Jackson died in Deep Blue Sea?  That method has returned.  The lead actor is a newbie with the name Steven R. McQueen, another rip-off.  It was good to see Elizabeth Shue, Ving Rhames, and Christopher Lloyd getting work again, but I think there is a reason you do not see Jerry O'Connell very much anymore, he even sucks in this movie.  It also has a pair of children who just yell and scream the whole time; that makes for pleasant movie watching.  My wife came home while I was watching this and joined me around the mid-point of it when the fish really get going.  She hates horror movies, but I tried to explain this was not a horror movie.  This is really making fun of horror movies and trying to use that tactic to make some money for itself.  The fish naturally choose spring break to start wreaking havoc and really, there was some sort of morbid satisfaction watching a bunch of frat boys and sororstitutes getting eaten alive by piranhas. Lessons learned:  you can kill a piranha with a shotgun (Ving Rhames), you can tase one to death (Elizabeth Shue), you can transform into a badass hero trying to save lives when you were just a nerdy seismologist diver a minute before (Adam Scott), and your silicone implants float to the surface after piranhas eat your boobs.",

At first, I thought that the movie will be superb. But when I saw it, it just had lackluster acting, a terrible plot and overreacted approach of the characters to a certain scene. It was a bad movie and I agree with some users that the poster looks better than the movie itself. So, don't expect too many great things about the movie just because of its poster because you don't know whether the actual movie is great......",

In fairness its no where near the height of Jaws, but it surely puts itself at second for best 'creature in the water movie.' Many wonder why the film has been recieving a positive response, and the answer simply is cause it is fun. Theres not much detail to go into here, but we actually care for these characters and the many stories is brilliant, and even the bloodless, boob filled first half of the film is entertaining for its pure shock value and laugh factor. But where the film shine is its second half, the tense scenes of trying to escape the boat, and finding the mauled body of a character whose still alive just no skin on his legs, is probaly the most disturbing of the film. We then cut to the fast paced craziness of what can only be described as the blood bath of trying to get out of the lake. Its just a really good time to watch, you cant fault the script and acting cause there even good enough, Piranha 3D is the sort of film you think I could watch again, or were genuinely on the edge of your seat, and for this genre of film is a rarity. Its by no means 2010 best film, but it is in a clear mile its most innocent, non caring fun fil , which anyone, over 18, could watch and will defintely thoroughly enjoy.",

For the love of God, Michael Bay would be ashamed to have his name on this thing, and he dumped fat dead people down city streets in \"Bad Boys II\".

Am I really supposed to find humor in a bunch of spring break teenagers getting chewed, bitten, torn, ripped and shredded to the bone? Am I supposed to laugh when a girl breaks in half while being carried to safety, or when the camera looks over all the half-eaten cadavers? Am I supposed to be entertained when a half-assed villain devoid of any and all character or human relatability comes crawling onto a deck with meaty twigs for legs? No. Absolutely not.
