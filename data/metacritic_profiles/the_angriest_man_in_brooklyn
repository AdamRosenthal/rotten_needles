You know it was one of the last movies of the legendary actor Robin Williams. That was not the reason for me to like it. The story begins to build on a silly reason, but it was a partially unique concept. Opens like a regular comedy and then turn over to the actual meaning for the contents it deals. Like the cancer theme movies it gets emotional in the later parts. There's no twists, but convinces the effort they had tried to end it on a high note. Sadly, it kind of depicts the actual life incident of Robin Williams. It is a great loss, I grew up watching 'Jumanji' and 'Flubber' and definitely he's going to live forever through his movies.",
