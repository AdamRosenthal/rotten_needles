      "text": "This is not a political satire. It is a satire on the media. It is about how the media appeals to our emotions to get us to feel a certain way about certain things. It is about how our opinions on certain events are mainly driven by how the media portrays them. This is a recurring idea throughout the movie, and it takes many forms. It criticizes the United States a lot more than you would think as well. The movie's screenplay deserves credit for its shrewd observations of the media and human emotions, and for its exciting story line. The opening scene, a song, is simultaneously hilarious for its lyrical content, and chilling for its disturbing social implication. In terms of comedy, there are a few clever jokes written, but the comedy, while there is a lot of it, mainly comes from the performances, especially from James Franco and Randall Park, who also both perform well in their dramatic scenes. The scene with the actual interview is one of my favorite scenes of the year. The movie deserves Oscar nominations for Franco, Park, and for the screenplay, but of course that will not happen, because the movie will be scoffed at by people who will never give it the credit it deserves simply because they will never be able to see past the fact that it is a James Franco / Seth Rogen comedy.",

Really though, what would you expect from two stoners who know nothing but potty humor?  The Interview has an okay start but ends up being something in the 'worst things you have ever watched' category.  This movie extra sucks for all the negative hype it generated only for the payoff to be worth nothing.  The world is going to see this movie after all the threats that have been made and digital hacks that have been accomplished and say \"They deserved it.\"  For Seth Rogan to go on television and say that this movie wasn't created to cause controversy makes him just as idiotic as this movie was.  This movie relies on celebrity cameos and bottom of the bucket humor to keep it going, but again, we've seen the same in every other one of his movies so not sure why I expected anything different.  Only difference between this and his other 'great' works are that instead of this one being based in a frat house its based in the in the real life setting of the supreme leader of North Korea WHO just so happens to be a film buff, like his insane father, as well a hot head about global relations at the moment; so for Rogan to say nothing was intended by this movie is a total lie.  Maybe years down the road when this conflict is over, yes, but not in the heat of it.  If this fat, unfunny stoner really just made things for the world worse over a nearly unwatchable 'comedy' then I vote that it's time for this guy to go away.",

The first 30 mins left me worried that the movie would be not great. James Franco's character is really dumb and kind of annoying, but as the story progresses, I grew to appreciate his 'lovable idiot' quality. There is a fair amount of toilet humour, which always lowers the quality of a movie if applied in heavy doses. I think that 'The Interview' tread that line very closely, but because of the overall quality of the characters, story, humour, I can abide the somewhat liberal helping of dick jokes. \u200bRendall Parker, the actor who plays Kim Jong Un, does a great job and deserves juat as much credit, if not more than Rogan or Franco.",

Well, think of it this way: all movies have certain target audiences the movie is meant for. Silent films, chick flicks, B-movies, biopic dramas, erotic XXX films, etc. These films aren't exactly meant to be enjoyed by the majority of the general public; they're most likely going to be enjoyed by a certain demographic. Likewise, \"The Interview\" is meant for a late teen/early adult public that likes R Rated comedies and satirical entertainment filled with pop-culture references (such as Family Guy or South Park). However, due to all the controversy and publicity this movie is getting (over NK's condemnation of the film and the hacks Sony has suffered from), a lot more people are seeing it than anyone could've once thought . People are seeing it to support free speech and as a sense of patriotic duty, to see WTF everyone is talking about, and to just be a part of the national buzz on the film. Now, is this a good thing for NK's current SUPREME LEADER? No. (He's kind of a mockery now--\"that fat little NK dumpling is an international joke\" according to one Metacritic user.) For freedom of speech? Debatable. For Sony? To be honest, I can't see Sony making much of a profit from online downloads and VOD purchases/rentals. But I could be wrong. Will The Interview change the way we watch movies? Maybe. Will it be the \"firework\" needed to cause a coup d'etat/revolution in NK? Who knows?",

The Seth Rogen/James Franco bromance has been hit and miss in the past but this movie was a definite hit. Most of the humor hinges on the absurd and the duo, especially Franco, delivers those scenes flawlessly. I also loved the supporting cast, especially Lizzy Caplan playing the attractive CIA agent and Randall Park doing a marvelous job portraying Kim Jong-un. Overall, while I know this isn't a comedy for everyone, I think a lot of people will be able to find plenty of laughs in the ridiculous plot and even more so in the hilarious way in which it unfolds.",

Overall it's not really a bad movie as a lot of people say it is, but it certainly could be better done than the form that it is in now.

Seth Rogen, as director (and actor), put this together well for the most part.

      "text": "No film in the history of cinema has had more press than the Interview. It almost started a war and made world headlines for almost a week, still it lost money, and is considered to be one of the biggest flops in recent history. In The Interview, the hottest duo in comedy, Seth Rogan and James Franco team up for their third feature film together. This time the pair play a TV talk show host and his producer respectively. Their show is like a combination of Maury and TMZ, and is considered by most in the media to be a joke. Wanting to change that image, the team decide to get in contact with the reclusive leader of North Korea, Kim Jong Un, for his first televised interview. Once announced, the duo is contacted by the CIA, who wishes to recruit them to take Un out. The first time I saw Rogan and Franco together was in Pineapple Express, and I thought it was one of the funniest films I'd ever seen. They have terrific chemistry and I expected great things from them in the future. It might have something to do with the fact that their characters are always so similar, but the more I've seen them together, the less impressed I've been. Seth Rogan is kind of annoying to begin with, especially that chuckle of his, but it's usual balanced out by Franco's extreme behavior. In the Interview, this dynamic didn't work, as Franco's character and portrayal was even more annoying than Rogan's. The cameos may have been impressive and so was all the attention this film received, but the truth is that many of the jokes were amateurish, and the film was a giant step back from Pineapple Express. When people work together, especially comedic duos, the films are supposed to keep getting funnier and more outrageous, but Rogan and Franco seem to be going the other way. The Interview isn't a great story and it isn't that funny, in fact, it's more frustrating than anything else. I love both Seth Rogan and James Franco, they've both given me hours of quality entertainment, but sadly enough, I can't add the Interview to that list, as it's bark was much worse than it's bite.",

The movie does stir up a couple laughs from me but it is hard to recommend when some of the jokes just fall flat and are left there to let it sit in with you. The only surprise the movie gave was the fact that the protagonist Dave skylark did not get with the good looking cia agent. The only risk this movie takes is taking a shot at North Korea. Overall the movie is alright, if you are feeling \"patriotic\" and want to stick it to North Korea then go watch this movie.

      "text": "Comedy has been known to be the most subjective, controversial and risk-taking genre, depending on what it is you are satirizing. When it involves politics, especially a controversial political figure, you are putting your reputation, and in this case, life (as well as many others) at risk. 'The Interview' finds Seth Rogen and James Franco in their most ambitious premise yet. Franco plays a hotshot entertainment host named Dave Skylark, whose show mostly revolves around interviewing big-name celebrities (we see Eminem making a cameo) as they reveal some of their hidden secrets (apparently, Eminem is gay!). Rogen plays Skylark's best friend and producer, Aaron Rapaport, who grows concerned for the show after hearing that it isn't intelligent enough television, especially when there are other bigger stories out there that are worth telling to the world, rather than a celebrity coming out of the closet. It's shocking news, but it shouldn't be classified as \"news\". One day, CIA Agent Lacey (Lizzy Caplan) meets up with Skylark and Rapaport to discuss some secret task. Dave is told he must interview North Korea's Kim-Jong Un (a very charismatic Randall Park), but he must also \"take him out\", in other words, kill the controversial figure, then everyone should be at peace. Both guys seem unsure about this, but at the same time, this would do well for their show, as they won't be interviewing big-name celebrities with shallow gossip. This is a political figure they will be dealing with, and it could be the most important interview for their show. This movie stirred up so much controversy as it led to the hacks of Sony Pictures, not to mention that several theaters pulled the movie from release, meaning that it can only be watched on VOD, or elsewhere on the internet. In other words, Sony took a big gamble funding this movie, and its writers and directors, Seth Rogen and Evan Goldberg, were ballsy enough to even come up with this idea. Mixing propaganda and comedy is not unusual, look at what happened when the great Charlie Chaplin made 'The Great Dictator' (1940) which was a massive parody on Adolf Hitler, who was a huge threat at the time. More often than not, I give credit to Rogen and Goldberg for having the guts to come up with such a risky premise, possibly aware of how controversial it was going to be. Although, I can't imagine they saw the hacks coming, leading to such an extent. The film is very funny from time to time, Rogen and Franco, once again, share terrific chemistry as bromantic buddies. Randall Park is electrifying as Kim, and the film does stay on track for the most part. There are times where the film tries too hard to be the typical Seth Rogen style, pot smoking, penis joking, party hard and swearing at every minute comedy. But, if you've seen a few of his other films... this shouldn't surprise you. The jokes do get old after the first half-an-hour or so.",

      "text": "This movie is amazing! But is a creeper. I watched it the 1st time and hated it, was so annoyed by it. But for some reason I watched the dvd again because I love \"seth & james\" together. I love the way they interact. The second time I watched everything clicked. I loved the cast and all the inside jokes. \"you honey dicking\" F-ing awesome! Lets talk about eminem in the opening, \"hector bisexually reck your rectum\" lol. James franco is really good in this role and delivers a very halirous performance. Seth plays the strait guys role sort of but is amazing too. I really had a blast watching this. So many funny moments. Its a movie the more you watch it the more you notice, things you missed the 1st time. Highly recommended.",
