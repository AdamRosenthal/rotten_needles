Along with the story, the dialogue was at times forced, and tried to remind us of older, better days, for the franchise.

Jason Clarke was outstanding as John Connor and delivers a thoroughly enjoyable performance and often steals the scene. Arnold is Arnold, take that as you well. The references and jokes regarding the previous films were enjoyable and appropriately delivered without being done. The action was good, but more importantly the plot was better. I've seen people say the plot is convoluted, but I completely disagree. It's no more complicated than Inception and is a perfectly legitimate story given the context of time travel. J.K. Simmons' character Detective O'Brien wasn't really necessary and could have been removed, BUT his presence in the story makes total sense. Overall this was actually quite well written and thoroughly enjoyable. It is completely faithful to the original two Terminator films and SIGNIFICANTLY better than the crappy Terminator: Rise of the Machines and Terminator: Salvation.

While the film is not bad per se it is not great either feeling like another rehash of the same old material.  If you count the TV show this is now the fourth time the main purpose is to stop Judgement Day and destroy Skynet.  This is the inherent problem with the franchise and the reason it should have stopped after \u201cTerminator 2: Judgement Day\u201d.  How many times can we watch the same story told over and over again?  To make matters worse the plot of the movie borrows heavily from \u201cThe Sarah Connor Chronicles\u201d.  I feel the series staple of time travel is used to excess in the film.  The cast is full of some of my current favorites doing their best to go through the motions on this retread.  Emilia Clarke brings her usual strength in a small package that serves her well on \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d to the role of Sarah Connor.  She strikes an excellent balance between the young T1 Sarah and the harsh chiseled Sarah of T2.  I do appreciate a quick joke in the film about her small stature since she stands just over 5\u20191\u201d in real life and the rest of the cast towers over her.  Jason Clarke really does well with John Connor in the opening act of the film in 2029 but his character somewhat comes off the rails in the latter half of the film.  Jai Courtney, as Kyle Reese, keeps getting roles despite having no chemistry with anyone he is ever in a movie with.  He brings none of the soul that Michael Biehn brought to the role 31 years ago.  For you \u201cDoctor Who\u201d fans blink twice and you\u2019ll miss Matt Smith, billed here as Mathew Smith, in a smaller than I hoped for role that carried a lot of importance but didn\u2019t get a lot of screen time.  Also fresh off his Oscar is J.K. Simmons who maybe hadn\u2019t won his Oscar yet when he filmed this because I didn\u2019t even know he was in it until the opening credits rolled.  As for Arnold Schwarzenegger reprising his role as the titular terminator there isn\u2019t much for him to screw up here.  The motion capture they used for his younger self is much better than it was in \u201cTerminator Salvation\u201d and the reason for him appearing as old as the actor is in real life fits perfectly in the narrative of the film.  While the film tries to recapture some of the emotional beats of T2 it comes up a little short and instead focuses on rehashing the same two jokes with his character the whole movie.  In the end if you are asking to see it, rent it, or skip it, it really depends on you the viewer.  If you are a big Terminator fan that would enjoy a nostalgia trip through the first film or are just looking for a decent popcorn flick then see it in the theater.  For everyone else I say rent it.  You won\u2019t be missing much even if the Mother of Dragons is in the movie.  There is a mid-credit scene so don\u2019t get up and leave once the credits start.  It is very brief but once you see it you can go.  There is nothing at the end of the credits.",

If you haven't watched Terminator 1 and 2 watch them before this because some parts especially the first 30 mins tie-in with them. There were some really confusing things in the movie (don't worry not a spoiler) During the beginning of the movie Kyle Resse is saved by John Connor (this may tie into Salvation timeline I don't know I haven't seen it yet) and Resse is a kid and Connor is grown its just odd. The best thing in this movie is Arnold Schwaranagger, he plays the T800 really well. Few of characters could of been used better, JK Simions (Whiplash, Spider Man) wasn't wasted but he could of played into the story more. When James Cameron gets the rights back in 3 years I hope it turns out better. I'm not going to this movie had some solid action scenes like the highway section and the Arnold vs T3000 (not going to tell you who that is if you didn't watch the 2nd trailer.) Jason Clarke (Child 44, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes) did a good as John Connor and Jai Courtney (Jack Reacher)  was functional as Kyle Reese. One thing I liked and had a problem with is that they brought back the T1000 (I think it's the same one) from T2 I liked that but they kinda wasted him they show most of his scenes in the 1st trailer. If you live and die by the first 2 movies, you might not like this. If you like all the terminator movies you will definitely love this movie, I personally really liked this movie.",

The first two films are classics; but this, like the previous two mediocre sequels, feels like recycled plot and action from the earlier movies. Instead of standing on its own as a new story, it tries too hard to prod nostalgia while trying to keep the door open for more Terminator movies down the road. A tough balancing act.

I think that this film shows that the franchise just needs to be put to bed or the rights need to be returned to James Cameron. The film is no where near as action packed or as fun as the first two films and even Rise of the Machines. Arnold Schwarzenegger is almost the sole actor that feels like his is in his element here and the other actors in the main cast seem to be misplaced. Terminator 5 is flat, uninspired and I just couldn't care less about most of the characters. The writing is really spotty and the film seems to be relying more on a lame romance than the action that wins over the audience. Terminator Genisys is a complete disappointment.",

Its A really good movie, has awesome action, and personally i think its right on par with terminator 1 and 2. This will probably become my favorite Terminator film since it has more action than any of the previous, but still manages to keep everything relevant and not overdue the action. I will say its going to be a bit hard to understand if you havent seen Terminator 1 and 2 because its draws on there story lines. Its a must to watch the originals if youve never seen them. Which brings me to the reason its possibly getting back reviews ,because people dont know WTF is going on. And you wont know whats going on unless you remember the originals!!

Movies that have mostly practical effects that are executed at a high level will always trump the fake ass CGI effects that most movies deploy today. The new Terminator seems to have a fair amount of practical effects in it and I overall enjoyed the movie. It was fun especially the first half when they had the nostalgic element running high. The 1984 reimagining was a lot of fun. The new Terminator was really cool and the action scenes were good to me. I was able to follow the story fine. The time travelling thing is getting old and I am ready for them to put that to bed. Have a movie set after Judgement day already finish off Skynet and put this series to bed already. Its like watching the same thing over and over. They've milked the lets come up with an even more bad ass Terminator than the last time and have it come after Sarah, John and Kyle again storyline.

At no point did anyone expect this to be any good, the trailer saw to that but I don\u2019t think anyone could predict how bad it truly is. There are no adequate words but I\u2019m gonna go for it anyway. So Arnie is back (in his many forms) to do what he does best, except this time he\u2019s called Pops, now if this wasn\u2019t a warning bell it pretty much explains why the rest of the movie was so terrible. Not only is this film horrifying on its own but it has to take Terminator 2 and in particular Terminator 1 and drag it through the dirt. It can\u2019t even establish itself as anything new, taking great scenes from the classics and rehashing them hoping the fans will be too caught up in the moment to notice. It singlehandedly destroys the first two Terminator movies and leaves us with this horrendously traumatizing and soul crushing sorry excuse for a movie.",

I always wanted to know how Terminators travel through time and it they showed us with a time machine. So if you remember the First Terminator the T 800 (younger) was sent to terminate Sarah Connor and I liked how they did the CGI. He got stopped by another terminator and then they both started to fight. I just love how Arnold was fighting his twin. Then the movie goes on what happened to the time line and why everything has changed. The Great things I like about this movie is how the action scenes were intense like you feel like something is going to happen and Arnold did his acting really well. The only con In have is that Kyle Reese was always complaining about what has happened with skynet and Sarah tried to explain but he wouldn't listen. This movie really had a big plot twist in a good way and that's when John Conner became the bad guy and it explains how in a flashback. Overall this was a great movie, critics may bash this movie because of the story but I don't really care I thought they did a good job. I give it a 9.0/10",

The production team tried their hardest, but simply cannot match the inventiveness of James Cameron's much superior original duology.",

The script is so convoluted filled with plot holes and it barely makes any sense, obviously the film is written by people who don't care for the franchise. The film has lackluster action, that's odd because the terminator series has great action scenes, director Alan Taylor does a slick way of directing the action scenes and copying off of James Cameron. John Connor (Jason Clarke) the leader of the human resistance, sends solider Kyle Reese (Jai Courtney) back in 1984 to protect his mother Sarah Connor (Emilia Clarke from 'Game of Thrones') from another terminator assassin, creating an unexpected turn of the events in the timeline; in the first Terminator Sarah is a scared waitress, but now she is a skilled fighter and has her Terminator guardian (played once again by Arnold Schwarzenegger) by her side. With good allies and dangerous enemies Reese sets out on an unexpected new mission: reset the future and prevent Skynet from launching their app before the robot apocalypse starts and destroys mankind. There are many flaws with the movie, Arnold once again is great and brings so much energy and like ability into the Terminator and Jai Courtney was missed cast however he was fine playing Kyle Reese. Emilia Clarke was missed cast as Sarah Connor (she can act but not in this movie) she over does with her performance and Jason Clarke was not a mediocre version of John Connor like Nick Stahl, Clarke can act but doing over doing it as the John Connor character. The film is not cheesy or cliche'd it's confusing as hell and the action is mediocre. Grade C-",

One small one in particular I wondered about is with the filmmakers going through all the trouble of recreating 1984 Los Angeles, with beautifully shot/VFX of the downtown skyline of that era for example, then go and blow a simple detail like LAPD using a collar radio instead of a walkie talkie in that year.  A very small flaw yes, but it amounts to sloppy direction.

Arnold does wonders for this film, giving credit to the character, the director a new approach to the film and yet classy to the Cameron feel of how the future is portrayed.  If anything that can be criticized was the studio company giving away too many plots too early in the marketing of, \"Terminator Genisys\", and the fact to have James Cameron talk about it to help endorse it.  As Arnold stated, \"The director did a fine job and it seemed that the studio wanted to get Cameron to endorse the film.\"  Along that context.  The only thing that besides too early of plot marketing of the film was also of the fact that too many details and give away's were leaked in the marketing giving a bad taste to the expectation of the film.  Emilia Clarke is good in her performance of Sarah Connor, and the rest of the cast as well.  The film gives excellent humor in the film if also homage to the catch phrases that made the franchise memorable.  The only downside for the film itself is the idea of speeding the story a little too quick at certain points but at the same time too throw in some mysterious plot points related to Arnold's character itself.  But while the slight mystery plots were potholes only at minor areas.  The film itself makes up in overall story, action, and an exciting roller coaster.  To the fans supporting this I quote, \"Excellent!\"  To the critics rating this movie at Metacritic, allow me to add an additional quote and misleading the fan base totally, \"Chill out, Dick-wad!\"",

The only reason I can think of that they're bashing this movie so hard is because they're probably setting their expectations for it waaaaay too high and possibly even expecting it to be as good as the first two films. If that's the case, then they have no one to blame but themselves for not liking this film, because it was never meant to be as good as the first two films. Those films are are masterpieces and this one was just meant to be a fun and entertaining action flick, which it was. And of course, it wouldn't be a Terminator film without Schwarzenegger himself in it (unlike the previous film, which threw in a cheap stunt double version of him), so it's good to see him in this. Overall, yes it has its cheesy and ridiculous moments (but what action flick doesn't nowadays?), and yes the writing and dialogue aren't up to par with some of the previous films, but at the end of the day, this was just a fun film and that's all I wanted out of this film.

The problem is that when it comes to these summer tent pole movies,  they always want to see something totally new and groundbreaking in terms of effects, which - to be fair-  this movie really does not do. OK- so the shape - changing Liquidmetal T-1000 Terminator in the film can't re-capture the magic of seeing it for the 1st -time 25 years ago in T2 ( it's like seeing Lightsaber's again in the Star Wars Prequels, no big deal, right? ) - nor does the new actor ( w/ is never explained ) upstage Robert Patrick's T-1000 - which would have been a real nice touch if they used his likeness in this movie ( they scanned him into the computer in 91 - so I don't know why they didn't? - ) but this film thankfully doesn't hang on that.  This new film was Way better than T3:, which was nothing more than a boring retread of T2- and didn't advance the story at all. You could skip it ( this new film does) and you wouldn't have missed a thing. Compared w/ this new take/ twist/ re-write of the timeline, T3 is lame. The original film now also  seems just outright dull compared to this flick. Do I believe the original actor's from the original were better? Yes, maybe they were?  But having said that - I didn't dislike the new cast at all. It's a different take, as this Sarah has lead a different life. This was easily the 2nd best Terminator film to date. It was far better than JJ's 2009 Re-boot of our beloved Classic Trek.   Genisys is only one of three movies I've watched in the theatre over the course of the last year -and I will be going to see it again.",

I would say #1 is T2 and #2 is the original and the last 2 are up for debate. I will start with the story which is the hardest part to grasp as it combines all of the movies and mixes them up. I mean they go through 3 different time periods so I will say it was an alright story plot for the fact that they did mix it up from the original formula. I will move onto the acting. I mean Arnold is a Beast like always and as for Sarah Connor who is played by Emilia Clarke from GOT I thought she felt out of place compared to Linda Hamilton. We also have Jason Clarke as John who I personally loved. I will finish in the acting department with Jai Courtney as Reese who I thought did a decent job considering he had to fill Michael Biehn's shoes which is almost Impossible lolz but he did a good job. I will finish with the action department and say that it was Fantastic and the CGI was used to perfection I thought. I also loved how they incorporated the T-1000 for a little while. I mean it had that Nostalgia that brought me back and I loved that for sure. I would also say that the movie had a decent amount of humor. I will now close out with saying that if you're a Terminator fan that you should definitely go and watch this movie. I would also recommend watching it in IMAX 3D because that is what I saw it in and it made it all the more EPIC.I can only hope and pray that they come out with an Unrated version of the film when it comes out officially on Blu-ray and DVD.",

Jai Anthony really needs to stop getting these kinds of roles as he's always too stiff and rigid compared to the rest of the cast.

I made a point to watch the original Terminator prior to viewing this film and was amused to see them recreate the scenes in which both Reese and 1984 T-800 arrive by time travel. The film was geniunely thought out and written quite clever. If one has a problem following a very simple plot, then go back to school, it wasn't hard to follow at the least. Brilliantly entertaining, and throws around an astounding theory that time, no matter if the past is changed, or the future, it is still linear. Loved this film, love the franchise. 10/10",

This approach to the franchise, and with Arnie back, Director Alan Taylor aims for the bare minimum Terminator movie, and yes, this is way better than Salvation. Jason Clarke gives a hammy performance as John Connor, but he is enjoyable, with a great story to tell, Clarke pumps life into Connor once again, one thing that Sam Warthingon couldn't do in T4. The opening sequence consists of a war between machine and man, one thing that this series has been all about' but if you really want to experience Genisys, I suggest you watch the film in the large format theatres, so you get the big picture, believe me, it's amazing. Emilia Clarke is good as Sarah Connor, as well, but is she as good as Linda Hamlinton in T2? No. But man does she try! But the holy grail of the pack, is Arnie! Holy crap, does this guy still have that swagger and bravado that made him The Terminator. He is a powerhouse on screen, the whole theatre started clapping during his one liners. Genisys has problems, it's way too long for an average action movie, and it's disappointing. It's not as good as I thought it would be, the teasers made it look special and top the three movies before it, not counting McG's disaster. Terminator Genisys is not a disaster and fans will love it for the action and Arnie.",

Also the characters are all horribly implemented. Yet other-all i cant say i wasn't entertained, because it was a fun film, also the return of Arnold Swarenager really is the films Charm, it is the greatest part of the film besides the action.

The threat of an omnipotent Skynet in the form of Genisys was a great idea to push this battered series back into relevance. Plus the action was top notch, and Emilia Clarke was looking as gorgeous as always. Arnold did a stellar job as well, putting as much humanity one can in the boots of a soulless killing machine. Jai Courtney's performance completely surpassed my expectations as well and had great on screen chemistry with both Jason Clarke and Emilia Clarke. The time travel aspects weren't overly complex and were perfectly reasonable considering the massive amount of dissonance in time already caused by the first two movies. The movie is without a doubt worthy of a solid 8.5 for just the astounding set pieces and Arnold Schwarzenegger alone. Jame Cameron was 100% on point when he stated that this movie is the true sequel to Judgement Day. So my recommendation is to ignore the critics and watch this movie with an unbiased view point and you'll have an absolute blast.",

The story has some plot holes (and at least one major unanswered question), but even if its script can't hold a candle to the second movie, it's certainly not the least-well-written Terminator film (that would be T3: Rise of the Machines). The effects are suitably cool and the actors are suitably cast. If there's one thing that Arnold S. actually can act like, it's a robot. Perhaps that's the picture's biggest crime - it's just suitable rather than phenomenal. It could be said that the Terminator franchise is like a rock band that peaked with their second album and has never recaptured that perfect sound.

Less darker than the other four installments, several twists are easily predicted and there is obviously a number of flaws and time paradox when the story progresses but the film is still an entertaining generic sci-fi. The scores of the film composed by Lorne Balfe are rather weak even though co-produced by Hans Zimmer, the performance of Jai Courtney as Kyle Reese is just alright, Arnold as T-800 is still the most entertaining element of the franchise with his fights and adorable robotic expressions but the pacing of the script has caused the lack of emotional engagement with Sarah Conner (Emilia Clarke). James Cameron says that this film is respectful to his first two installments back in 1984 and 1991 but action sequences are nothing new, CGIs do not improve much from previous installments and the visual effects seems a bit video game setting have overall disgraced his compliment.",

The acting was sharp with some nice laughs thrown in so it doesn't take it self so seriously. Also kudos to Hollywood for making it PG-13 so it's more family oriented. Keep it classy. A big applause to director Alan Taylor (The Sopranos, Game of Thrones) and bringing in \"Khaleesi\" to play Sarah Conner (babe alert!) - significantly cuter than Linda Hamilton. And more chill. No offense. The movie also makes some good social commentary on the use of technology.

Salvation will feel like a distant memory here as the darker post-apocalyptic feel has been traded in for a more modern-day action flick.  While it has its moments of fun action, I couldn't help but feel like Genisys is trying too hard to be an Avengers movie that effortlessly channels moments of humor and cleverness into the potential end-of-the-world giant that is the story.  On top of that, the seriousness rarely felt that serious.  Partially because of the writing, partially because of the casting.  Arnold is fine, but the casting choices for John Conner and Reese seem wrong in hind-sight.  Neither quite fit into their role, making me wonder why the director and casting crew felt compelled to move forward with both.  There are missed opportunities within the expanded story as well - the new face of Skynet offered such a fantastic opportunity to make Terminator more than just a bit of nostalgia.  This could have been more on the level of Inception, but it isn't.  Alas, Genisys is just another cog in the wheel that is a franchise that has really shown its age.  Terminator 3 may stand as the weakest of the movies to some, but Genisys isn't all that much better (if at all).  Should they find reason to make another one, they'll have a helluva lot of rubble to dig through to clear the name.  Perhaps it would be better if they left it alone?",

Honestly, the first 30 or so minutes had me hooked.....but then something happened! Something i never saw coming, the characters didnt fit their roles, they didnt ACTURATELY portray sarah connor or kyle reese, allow me to explain. In the original terminator, kyle reese was DEFINATLEY a soldier by the way he acted and spoke but the 2015 portrayal of kyle reese was so bad he seemed to be some ordinary joe trying to survive attacks from killer cyborgs. And sarah, i must say that linda hamilton did a great job of her portral of the mother of legendary soldier john connor, she truly set the standard for that character, thats why when i saw the new version of sarah connor and how they wrote her character, i was thouroghly disgusted! She wasnt strong, she was angry! She wasnt fierce, she was just a **** a TOTAL **** who acted more like an uppity feminist with a chip on her shoulder! Now the story/plot, its not bad but mainly confusing and for them to shuffle john connor off to the side as if he doesnt matter anymore and basiclly put kyle in the spotlight as he's now the future savior is just wrong to me! Anyway, i enjoyed the movie but i was honestly disappointed. I was expecting more but i was left wanting........6/10",

I\u2019m not angry I\u2019m just disappointed. It has a plot that basically makes you go \u201cwhat the hell?\u201d for an hour and a half and basically acts as too many re-makes of Terminator 1 & 2 that don\u2019t really work unless you have actually seen those two!  I\u2019m not really a fan of these re-imagining versions of the characters, there is a whole lot that is not really explained and it won\u2019t really warrant repeat viewing because it will only work  to further hi-light the amount of plot holes in this film and there\u2019s tons of really heavy handed we rely on technology too much messages in the film.  Apart from Matt Smith\u2019s rather interesting turn as a villain for this film, there is not really that much memorable here and I suspect this one will be cast aside to the cusp.  Terminator has become like Highlander in that anything that came after it, they only got a brief stint at being very good and everything that followed, has sucked.  This film keeps up the tradition.  The action scenes are very decent, but they are very repetitive and the film\u2019s effects really vary in quality, not to mention the acting isn\u2019t entirely par.  I especially did not like Kyle Reese in this film and what they did to John Connor was almost inexcusable.",

The movie has it's moments on the action side and the ideas to storyline arent so badly performed.

Would you want to have  movie with the same plot every year? I would think you wouldn't unless you are completely intellectually incapable of following complicated plots. The reboot of Star Trek in 2009 had an altered timeline? What makes Terminator Genisys so bad compared to Star Trek? Yeah, sure Jai Courtney wasn't the best Kyle Reese, but he sure beat Christian Bale who played John Connor in Salvation.  Jason Clarke as John Connor is Genisys was by far my favourite. Yeah maybe some just don't care for the movie, that's fine. I personally loved the movie, but I really only watched it for Jason Clarke. If a sequel is to happen cough, With Jason Clarke cough, I would watch it for sure, without a doubt. I'm sure people disagree with my review, but really don't care what other people think about the movie. This is \"my\" honest to god thoughts on the movie.

That storyline makes total sense and was not hard to follow at all. Here an example of nothing the producers could have done would have changed the critic reviews because every critic hated T3 and T4 and so what does T5 do, it practically erases them from existence in a much better way, and what was the critics response. Oh, what are the producers doing, are we just going to pretend T3 and T4 never existed. So basically Terminator Genisys gave the critics everything they wanted for 12 years and the reviews were still bad.

      "text": "Terminator Genisys is an action lovers action movie. It stands out among the Terminator films in its ability to understand the Cameron formula. It only takes itself seriously in its telling of the alternate timeline, which it projects admirably. Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jason Clarke, Jai Courtney, and J.K. Simmons handle themselves and each other with beautiful conviction, while Emilia Clarke is somewhat subdued in the lackluster role she portrays-she appears to be the weak link. Writing, music, production, and direction are on point while costume is no more or less than general, yet, precise. The parallels to the human condition are poignant, yet not overtly dramatized. All in all this is a fun flick with true popcorn potential. Enjoy your refills!",
