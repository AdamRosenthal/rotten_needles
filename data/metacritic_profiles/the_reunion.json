We all know, or atleast most of us, that shotguns are meant up close and only work that way. Unless it was pure luck shots, which it must have been, that was the only really bad thing in the movie. It had a nice ending, with moral in it. Some movies end without moral and sad, twisted endings. This isn't one of them, so well done on that one. Cena was surprisingly good as an actor, I wouldn't mind seeing him act in more films in the future.",
