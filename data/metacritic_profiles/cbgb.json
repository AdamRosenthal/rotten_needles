This is especially notable in a scene where, apropos of nothing,  the guy from The Big Bang Theory offers a blowie to a guy we're supposed to believe is Iggy Pop...for some reason.  I assume it was supposed to be some of the comedy we were promised, but, forced in as it was,  it was just confusing.",
