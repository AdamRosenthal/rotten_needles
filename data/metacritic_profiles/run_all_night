Neeson is a character you generally care about and he is vulnerable at points in the movie where in the last installments in the Taken series it seemed as if he was invincible. Ed Harris also has a strong performance in the film and its nice to see him as the evil one as it seems like he is normally a good guy in most cases. However, one of may problems with the film is that there are two many important players in the film. You get the  Mafia, the police, and an assassin all at once and although that's pretty cool there are points where it seems like it too much.

Still, was entertaining to watch and it also had some side storylines kinda, not only just shooting each other stuff. Anyway, not too complicated and a good movie if you are into action movies",

The tensions feels forced at firsf, then it gets very real. The violence gets excessive. And some. But still a brilliant movie.",
