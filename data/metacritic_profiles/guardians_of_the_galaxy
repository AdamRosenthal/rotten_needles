It's the Motley Crue of comics and as such goes a bit over the top and loud which is what I think made it so successful. It sort of has a Sons of Anarchy quality. The characters are all outcasts. The actors/actresses did a great job bringing the characters to life and even surprised me with Bradley Cooper's performance of Rocket who steals the movie along with Groot. I thought Chris Pratt did a cool job playing Quill. Music was spot on and fit the universe really well. Great production, costumes and CGI effects. It isn't without it's problems however. Weak main villain both in design looks and motives (Lee Pace was great tho). Like others have said.. devices which are dangerous until a plot point is revealed that it isn't dangerous really at all. Some of the plot beats were a tad boring on re-watching like the prison sequence, collector, and last half of the movie with the final attack on Xandar but the ending more than makes up for it. Bit concerned what the sequel will be like now since we have Nebula joining the good side and baby Groot will no doubt be all about comic relief (I find baby characters pretty annoying but that's just me) but I think James Gunn will deliver the goods. Those nit pickings aside it's an awesome movie, especially if you're a fan of that outcast, road warrior sort of humor.",

That's what this movie is about.  If you were looking for even the faintest clue that this movie was produced for intelligent beings, you won't find it.  I wonder if the people who enjoyed this movie let the eye candies, the light show and the explosions capture them and put them into a trance where their brain is completely shut off.  Does the masse love \"cheesiness\" and clich\u00e9 that much?   Do they no longer wish to find even the tiniest bits of wit or originality in humour?  Do they even still know how to appreciate such a thing?   One of many examples illustrating the lazy juvenile writing of this movie :  Girl waits for guy at entrance of a pawn shop (or whatever) and gets him into a conversation.  Guy juggles this precious object that pretty everyone wants to get their hands on. Girl snatches it from him and runs away on foot in broad daylight.  I mean seriously.  Don't they even try?

You follow a group of misfits turned unlikely heroes with the goal of saving the galaxy from a **** crazy antagonist with plans of destroying said universe. Most importantly, you get to see Chris Pratt's name on the big screen which is pretty cool for those who saw him come up as the goofy actor on parks and recreation. I went into this expecting more of a kiddish movie based on the pg-13 rating but I was pleasantly surprised to see marvel held very little back, what with swearing, some brutal killings and at least one dick joke, good ol' rating system. All in all this is an awesome movie that pretty much everyone has seen by now, but if you haven't, get your ass to the nearest theater and see it on the big screen for best results, going not sober also wouldn't hurt the experience as a whole.",

In particular, the device of the walkman could have been brilliant, but the filmmakers lack originality in their music choices and simply coast on songs that have already had their massive cultural moment (in particular \"Hooked on a Feeling\" which all but belongs to Quentin Tarantino, not to mention momentous choices from \"Boyz in the Hood\" and a PSH scene from \"Almost Famous\"). It would be one thing if Gunn was either 80 years old, or 22, but Gunn came of age with these other films (I'm assuming he's seen these touchstones) so his borrowing feels much more like laziness than homage.",

There was nothing about this movie that really drew me in, and it's because the character stories were rushed so fast that you didn't get a chance to feel anything for them. We get to see each character for a few minutes before their paths collide. So when the characters only know each other for a few days, we're expected to believe they've bonded to the point where they'll die for each other? This movie should have been an animated film for kids in my opinion. The dumbed down dialogue sure fit. I really wish they focused the story on Peter Quill, instead he felt like a side character. That's probably because we have five heroes, four villains, and tons of side characters: Yondu and his crew, the Collector and his slave, Nova Prime and the entire Nova Corps. So many pointless characters could have been cut from this film, and the necessary time could have been given to develop Quill's story. This would have improved the movie dramatically. Don't get me wrong... all the characters in this movie do look really interesting, however, you can't squeeze all their stories in a 2 hour film, otherwise it's a mess. The directing was great, the overall story was good, the action and special effects were superb, but the characters are so shallow... the core flaw with this movie is the numerous characters that shouldn't be in a film that's introducing the casual viewer to a completely new universe. Keep it simple. This is not the Avengers, where each super hero already had their own individual films that established their character's background.",

Also, Chris Pratt proved to the world that he is ready for a leading role in his quirky, sarcastic and comedic role. All of the supporting characters DELIVERED as well from Bautista's Drax proving his merit as an actor to Zoe Saldana proving she is fit to play the deadliest woman in the galaxy.

I was quite wrong. Guardians of the Galaxy is a fantastic film that is one of Marvel's top 5 best films. Not only does the film feature the great action you'd expect from a marvel flick, but this film had comedic elements that were missing from many marvel films over the past few years. The Acting/Voicing by all of the main cast members (specifically Pratt and Cooper) was fantastic, giving us a very good depth of their characters. The best part of the film, however, was it's humor. The humor in this film was fantastic, making it a much funnier, lighter, and better entry than the previous two out of Marvel Studio (WDSMP), Captain America: The Winter Soldier & Thor: The Dark World. Overall, this along with the two films mentioned earlier just made this summer one f*****g fantastic summer movie season.",

The film is well-paced and doesn't take itself too seriously.  While there are a couple of plot points that might leave hard-core Marvelites kind of puzzled, there are no gaping holes that I noticed and the cast totally delivers on their misfit characters.  Probably the nearest thing I can compare GotG to is Firefly, and that's hardly a bad thing.  Its funny, action-packed, occasionally clever and does a great job of introducing us to the larger Marvel universe (literally).  I was worried that we wouldn't see another big summer film as fun as Pacific Rim for a long time but thankfully I was wrong.  If there is a complaint to be found its that the after-credit scene was kind of weak, although pretty appropriate considering the tone of this flick.  It was still better than the one in Winter Solider and a cute gift for all True Believers.

While, Ronan is a rather dull main villain, due to his absence in cameo or mention in previous films, Nebula is played amazingly by Karen Gillian. However, she was rather unused. Rocket stole the show with his brilliant portrayal from Bradley Cooper and unbelievable CGI. As for Groot I have never felt so emotional about a character who only ever says \"I am Groot\". Well directed by James Gunn. Great Movie. Definitely go see it.",

The only superhero movie to date that I think rivals it in pure humor is Thor 2 but that was largely thanks to one person, Kat Dennings. This film has great laughs thanks to every character. From Peter Quill constantly fighting his ego to Gamora's \"who put the sticks up their butt\" misunderstanding to Drax not being able to understand metaphors to Rocket's abrasive edge to Groot's incredible dialoque, they all provide laughing moments throughout the film. The action sequences were done really well, as is to be expected from Marvel these days. The plot also unfolded nicely. I was worried in the beginning that they were trying to stretch the audience's attention too thin and have too many plot elements going on at once but they merged fairly quickly and developed well. I still would've preferred for this element of the Marvel universe to stay separate from the Avengers but hey, it's still very entertaining.",

Now, it did have good special effects, and I liked the songs in the first few scenes, but everything else either made no sense at all, or was poorly-written. The opening title sequence was lousy, as Chris Pratt broke out into dance for no reason other than so the credits could show who made it and who starred in it, and then when the aliens threatened to arrest him for stealing the orb, he looked genuinely shocked. It was his fault for wasting all that time dancing for no reason other than something that is beyond the fourth wall. If you enjoyed this movie, fine. I think kids could get a kick out of this movie, though there are some elements that parents may not like. I, however, could not enjoy this movie at all and didn't even finish it due to how bad it was.",

There's too many superhero movies like this.  This is not one of them.  We loved the movie.  We saw it last night, and I haven't stopped thinking about it since.  I would gladly go see it again while still in theatres.  It is very rare that I ever would want to do that, so that means the movie was good.  It was very entertaining.  Kept my interest throughout.  I thought it had a perfect mix of comedy, action, and drama.  I loved the soundtrack.  Rocket Racoon's special effects were great.  I joked that they must have spent all their money on this because the makeup on some characters was a bit subpar.  It looked like they didn't hire enough makeup people and they rushed through certain characters.  Makeup aside, this is a very entertaining movie, you should go see it.  Just please, don't stay for the scene after the credits, it was so stupid.  Everyone else sat and waited, and it was so dumb, there was a huge sigh of \"ughhhh\" throughout the theatre.  Don't waste your time.  But the rest of the movie was great (including the scene that happens near the beginning of the ending credits.)",

      "text": "Not many people are familiar with the Guardians of the Galaxy, so a lot of people thought Marvel was taking a very big risk making a movie for these characters. The trailers looked great in every way, yet people were still skeptical. I'm here to confirm it people, along with many others-Guardians of the Galaxy is the movie you wanted, and delivers so much more. Peter Quill, Gamora, Rocket, Groot, and Drax come on screen to deliver possibly the funnest time you will have at the theatre this year. Funny, heartwarming, clever, and action packed can all be words to describe this awesome movie. So since the movie is named after this group of characters, let's talk about these characters. Chris Pratt plays the leader, Star Lord, and I've never seen him better. He was just the perfect choice for this role. While Pratt is amazing, there's one character that truly steals the show: Rocket. How did you not expect this raccoon that spits out hilarious lines with big guns to be the star of the show? Bradley Cooper's voice for him was also amazing. Then there's Gamora. Zoe Saldana is known for being a great sci-fi movie actress, and she's well known for her very, very, very good performances in Avatar and the new Star Trek flicks. She's just as good here, and even though there's not a lot of it, her chemistry with Pratt is great. There's not much to say about Groot since he only says \"I am Groot\" for the movie, but I loved his abilities and watching him in action. One of the less noteworthy ones is Drax. Marvel made a bit of a mistake here by hiring a former wrestler. While Drax does have very good lines and funny sarcasm, the guy that plays him is not a great actor. The main villain, Ronan, wasn't very good, either. Overall, he was serviceable, but I just felt he was generic. His main motivations come from his generic story about how his father was killed and now he wants revenge. However, seeing the 5 guardians come together and interact on screen was a constant delight. The story isn't overly complex starting out, and it doesn't get to that later on, either. 85% of the time I was fine with that, though. Almost 100% of the time this movie is simply hilarious. I can't tell you how many times I was laughing out loud hysterically. This movie also has an awesome soundtrack. Me being a 70's and 80's rock lover, I loved every track. The movie also has great action sequences. The most memorable parts are all-out dogfights, but the guardians can also kick ass gloriously without aircraft. Great visuals compliment the action, too, but at small times it looked like live-action. Despite flaws with Ronan and Drax, a very slight amount of complexity, and not-always-perfect visuals, Guardians of the Galaxy is a complete blast. Marvel took a risk with this flick-but what's the pay off here? You should know after all the stuff I've said so far: BIG TIME!",

The film is a brilliant mix of compelling characters, solid acting and amazing production. Chris Pratt is absolutely perfect as Star Lord. It's great to see him on the big screen in comparison to his character Andy in Parks & Recreation. I think one of the main reasons the film has done so well is the well balanced addition of off-beat humour, something which isn't a common thread in Marvel comic book movies to date.

I haven't laughing at a Marvel movie so much since Thor, and it was perfect for balancing out the serious moments of the movie, maybe overstepping that balance a little but given the goofy tone it was going for; I can't blame the movie for it.

Zoe Saldana is great as Gamora, making the character so interesting, that I wanted to know more. The real surprise is Dave Bautista as Drax. For this being his first movie since leaving the WWE, he does a pretty good job and has a few good jokes on his own. The humor in the movie is great, easily making it Marvel's funniest movie to date. Most, if not all, the jokes hit the mark and are clever. The action is top-notch and what we have come to expect from Marvel movies. I've seen some reviewers complain how Ronan isn't very interesting, and I don't really agree. Ronan is very menacing and Karen Gillan as Nebula, his henchmen, adds to his awesomeness. Overall, the movie is one of, if not the best summer blockbusters this year and definitely on my top 10. The hardest question I had to ask myself was whether I liked this or Captain America more. :) BTW Make sure to stay for the end-credits scene, it's a funny surprise!",

I swear it is just switch, switch, switch, etc. etc. throughout the whole movie. I sensed something wrong when the lead character just easily escapes the killers in the beginning. I mean he just skips past them and lands in his ship and zoooooom, is out of there with lasers shooting all around him. Lame. The whole movie is like this. They should have all been killed 100 times by the end of the movie. I mean seriously- the girl was blown out of her pod and the guy shoots out and gives her his mask thingy and they are both saved. No way. They should have both been dead 20 times in just that scene alone. And the big guy. Didn't he get stomped by the bad guy and thrown into a pool of mustard. And submerged there for a good while. He just jumps on up and is back in action. I guess the movie expects us to all accept that they all have live forever superpowers.  Story- boy is it horrible. I may have missed something but a softball sized orb that has all of the power in the universe. I could have thought of something more original than that. The lead guy somehow knew how to conjure it in the beginning to sell to a pawn shop. Then all of the bad guys are chasing them for it throughout the whole movie. The one liners to put some comedy in it were so horrible. I just felt this way about the Lego Movie. Horrible story, action scenes that are way too over the top with fast switching frames where they escape among a hail of bullets time after time again, lame attempts at comedy, and way too long is how I feel about both movies.

The acting fell a bit flat at times but it was still another really good movie released by Marvel Studios. The group that was in the movie was a bit different as the GotG aren't that popular in the comic world. Barely anyone knew who they were at the time of the movie being announced but Marvel took a risk and it worked out very well. There was more of an emphasis on humor in this movie, which is probably why they hired a fairly well received comedian for the staring role in Chris Pratt. The humor is well done and the dynamic that is infused within the movie is really well done, especially with Rocket and Groot, who provided most of the humor the movie delivered. The movie had alot of action in it too and it bounced back and forth between the two very well. The only problem I had was with probably the most well known actor in the group and that was Zoe Saldana. She fell flat a few times here and there and I just felt like she was disinterested in what she was doing half the time on screen. It's not enough to ruin the movie but it was noticeable for me. At the end of the day though, this was a very well done movie and another good movie done by the Marvel Studios. It's the last one of the year for them and they went out with a pretty big bang.",

Zoe looked great in blue in Avatar, but covered in green in many of the shots she looks unattractive, which is something I never thought I would say about her. She's always been the sexiest actress around in my book. The story is your average save the world from a weapon of mass destruction plot, where the bad guy has absolutely no motive for being destructive. Maybe once it becomes available for a few bucks it might be worth a casual viewing from the corner of your eye when you're doing something else, but as I write this it's only downloadable for $20, and it is definitely not worth that.",

I can say all these things were in my advantage when I went to sit in the cinema hall like an empty minded. The opening credits began to roll, me too slowly started to dissolve with the movie.

Marvel took a risk on the source material considering that the characters aren't as well known as the likes of Iron Man, Hulk & Captain America. But the overall execution is flawless. These characters are all perfectly cast, instantly loveable & absolutely hilarious. Chris Pratt's Peter Quill a.k.a Star Lord is one coolest anti-heroes ever and you root for his larger than life character because he has such human and relatable qualities that bring him down to our level. His character pleasingly had a vibe than reminded me of classic heroes like Han Solo & Indiana Jones. Zoe Saldana's Gamorra is a worthy heroine, Bradley Cooper's voice work for Rocket Racoon is hilarious and Vin Diesel's Groot steals the show. Most surprisingly Dave Bautista is brilliant as Drax the Destroyer, he brings a real physical screen presence and he adds witty and dry humour. Michael Rooker, Peter Serafinowicz & John C. Reilly are all fun and worthy mentions also. Sadly the only characters who feel underdeveloped, generic and forgettable are the villains. But otherwise this is one of the funnest films I've ever seen. One of the most successful elements of the film has to be the soundtrack. The Awesome Mix Vol. 1 tape is pure genius and it feels like a character in it's own right. It's definitely one of the best, most varied and most inventive soundtracks of all time. Featuring tracks from the likes of 10cc, David Bowie, Jackson 5 & of course Blue Swede. The set pieces are all thoroughly enjoyable and visually this is a very entertaining film. But what sets this film aside from the wrest of Marvel cinematic universe is the genius use of humour, banter and bickering between the characters. And unlike the the wrest of the Marvel films to date, this feels more like a comedy that features great action and set pieces, rather than an action film with segments of humour thrown in. The Guardians of the Galaxy made me laugh and smile from start to finish and sentimentally I'll forever love this film.",

      "text": "So we see a flashback to late 80's of a little boy in a waiting room with a Walkman listening to a mixtape from his mother who is in the next room dying from cancer. The little boy is Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) who later grows up to be the self proclaimed Star Lord , we see the boy was called into the hospital room to say goodbye to his mother she gives him a gift (which later is very important ) and offers her hand to him , but before he can take her hand she dies, he is then ushered from the room by grieving family , understandably distraught he runs from the hospital room only be abducted by a spaceship piloted by an alien Yondu (Michael Roofer) . Fast forward 30 years to the present and Peter Quill/Star Lord is free spirited wanderer,  space cowboy, womanizer  (think Han Solo only goofier) who surfs the galaxy looking for treasure to steal and turn for a profit, he stumbles onto an orb that is wanted by a bad guy named Ronin ( Lee Pace)  who wants it's to destroy and rule worlds across the galaxy, you know the usual bad guy stuff. He makes a deal with overlord major baddie Thanos (voiced by Josh Brolin) to help him destroy a planet but all Thanos wants is the rock (kinda like Kobe Bryant) , Ronan receives both of Thanos daughters Nebula (Karen Gillian) & Gamora (a sexy Zoe Saldana ) the latter  who may have ulterior motives to help him retrieve the Orb , Star Lord is captured trying to steal the powerful orb which is later revealed to be extremely powerful, The rest of the  G.O.G Team is Rocket Raccoon (Bradley Cooper) a psychotic bio-engineered rodent with quick wit and trigger finger ,  he has most of the funny lines and scenes, Draxx the destroyer (Dave Bautista) basically a simple minded brute looking for revenge for his family's murder by the hands of Ronin , Groot (Voiced by Vin Diesel) a tree/enforcer with a lot of hurt but a limited vocabulary , these reluctant Heroes when thrown in prison together band together for the greater good of alien-kind. The whole team has their moments to shine individually, but this is easily the most funny , epic , heartwarming , movie of the year I can't wait to see Guardians 2! Good job Marvel with all that character development in two hours which  is not easy,  neither is that epic dance off. This is the Star Wars for the 21st century. Two Geek thumbs wayyyyy up !",

Very good characters and lots of them.  If there is one thing I am not too keen on is the lack of effort and originality when it comes to all these aliens.  Marvel needs to do more than just color people with odd makeup.  Chris Pratt is ok and likeable.  Still not sure why he is considered to be anything more than average.  The story is pretty sound.  The humor is great.  Kinda reminds me of a better The 5th Element.  For a super hero movie, no one is really a super hero with super powers unless you count tree man, Groot voiced by Vin Diesel.  Seriously Vin, I hope hey did not pay for much for your one line.  In my opinion, Bradley Cooper steals the movie in every scene.",

It even beats Iron Man series, provided the fact that I really like Iron Man, as it was the movie that made the wheels spinning ( RDJ will be alwys my favourite ). Every actor in Guardians of the Galaxy did an awesome job portraying their character.

      "text": "Guardians of the Galaxy is officially my favorite Marvel movie. It's the most light-hearted Marvel movie that you will ever see. Now don't get me wrong, the main characters of the film are more-so antiheroes if anything, but there are some memorable moments that sometimes left me in tears (mostly doing with Groot). The movie's beautiful soundtrack is consisted of 70's pop songs or Star-Lord's (Chris Pratt) Awesome Mix Vol 1. This is the funniest and most enjoyable Marvel movie that I've seen. The CGI in the film is astonishing with renderings of Rocket Raccoon and Groot doing the series justice. The story is cohesive and you are able to actually follow what is going on as the main characters make realistic decisions and aren't cookie cutter superheroes. This movie blends action, comedy, and touching moments perfectly. If you are a fan of Marvel films or sci-fi movies, go watch Guardians of the Galaxy ASAP!",

When I saw the trailer originally before a different movie, I thought that it'd be a terrible Marvel movie.  I didn't know who these guys were, and I thought Marvel was taking a risk that wouldn't pay off.  I was wrong.  This movie was hilarious, high action, and just plain awesome.  All the heroes have special things about them that make them funny.  The special effects are also amazing.  It felt like new Star Trek and Avengers were mixed together and served with a side of hilarious comedy.  All in all, 9/10 is a fair score for this movie.",

      "text": "Arthur Maggott, the worst of the death row inmates in which the United States Army absconds to combat the Germans is a convicted rapist; a Christian deconstructionist ingrained with the haywire belief that Eve alone brought \"original sin\" into being; a veritable loose cannon whom Major Reisman should have recognized as being a detriment to his mercenary outfit. In the manner that The Dirty Dozen serves as a loose template for Guardians of the Galaxy, the basis for Star Wars, likewise, garners its narrative animus from a non-sci-fi antecedent: Akira Kurosawa's The Hidden Fortress, another film that features sexually depraved characters, but here the lowlifes are utilized for comic relief. C3PO and R2D2, the artificially intelligent droids Luke and his uncle purchase from the Jawas are modeled after Tahei and Matashichi, the two lowly peasants who accompany Rokurota Makabe, a general, burdened with the precarious task of protecting Princess Yuki, the last remaining survivor of the Akizuki clan. The princess, undercover as a mute girl, is preyed upon by the decrepit hirelings, knowingly taking wanton advantage of a presupposed cripple who wouldn't be endowed with the means to stop a potential sexual assault by vociferous petition. So taken for granted is the unquestioned altruism of C3PO and R2D2, it can be somewhat jarring to learn that their filmic bloodlines consist of gold-starved opportunists who would participate in a woodland gang-rape had they possessed the necessary brawn and speed to catch Yuki. C3P0, the analogue for Tahei, now seems less like some gay man than a eunuch, which would account for his feminine voice and anatomically incorrect body. It's punishment; it's karma. And R2D2, owner of an extending tool-tipped appendage employed, once thought, solely for quotidian purposes; most memorably, when he fixes the Millenium Falcon's hyperdrive generator, looks more and more like a phallic symbol, giving the seemingly sexless robot the potentiality for amorous feelings towards Leia. In Guardians of the Galaxy, Groot, a tree, and Rocket, a raccoon, share the same binaries as C3PO and R2D2: tall/short, feminine/masculine, and most importantly, celibate by circumstance/celibate by default. Whereas the tree lacks the genitalia for intercourse, Rocket does, but is doomed to be \"the other\", just like R2D2, since nobody could reciprocate romantic love from an entity so singular. It's not vitriol, but disguised longing that Rocket expresses with vehemence, when the bounty hunter lobs insults at the people he sizes up through his view-finder, since the toddler, the male/female couple, and finally, Peter Quill, the terra womanizer, inhabit a spatial proximity to life he can only glimpse from afar. Unlike R2D2, the golden droid understands his limitations and tries to protect his electronic friend, advising him against having \"delusions of grandeur\". Later, just before R2D2 boards Luke's x-wing starfighter, en route to blowing up the death star, C3PO says, \"You wouldn't want my life to get boring, would you?\" It's a declaration of love, platonic or otherwise; the makings of a bizarre love triangle, a futile one, at best, when it's obvious that R2D2 is no match for Han Solo in wooing the princess, even though he's a better mechanic than Chewbacca, and yet is unfairly overlooked at the medal ceremony. Only C3PO knows what all that beeping is about, only he knows the secrets of R2D2's heart. Similarly, only Groot understands his raccoon friend. Like C3PO, he tries to save Rocket from disillusionment. At the Kyln, as a survival tactic against the prison population, Rocket asks Gamora to \"work out some kind of trade,\" pointing out to Ronan's minion that the \"bald bodies find [her] attractive,\" which is to say, he does too. The love, it's there. When the Rocket's prison breakout plan is expedited, once Groot removes the quarnex battery from the watchtower, he grabs a big machine gun, overcompensating for his shortcomings, and as a result, he hopes, will have the effect of impressing Gamora, whom the raccoon knows will inevitably fall for Quill. While intoxicated, after a fight with Drax, he screams, \"I'll kill every last one of you,\" as he aims his gun at the buff widower, who calls him \"vermin\". Even more hurtful, he is called \"rodent\" by Gamora. Rocket doesn't beep and whir; he doesn't need a protocol droid to translate for him. Rocket is a psychopath. But is he dirtier than Drax, the Maggott-like misogynist who thinks Gamora is a \"green whore\"? Although she is only a pawn in the Kree army, he is more than willing to slit her throat, similar to how Maggott stabs to death the wife of a Nazi SS officer at the Berlin compound. No. After the Nova Corp expunges the criminal records of all the Guardians, Drax asks Corpsman Dey if removing somebody's spine is a crime. Conversely, love redeems Rocket. \"We are Groot,\" the tree tells the raccoon; tree for \"I love you.\"",

This may not be the most well constructed or well put together Marvel film in fact it might be the weakest of Phase 2 but it was the most fun I\u2019ve had watching a Marvel movie since The Avengers, which while I didn\u2019t think it was the best of comic book movies was entertaining, and considering how dark and brooding a lot of comic book movies are now it was nice to have something fun that was just a nice standalone film. And give Marvel credit for blowing away my skepticism and making this film about a group I\u2019ve never heard of work. Because this film has little to no substance, it doesn\u2019t have as much rewatch value as other Marvel films like Captain America: The Winter Soldier but as a fun summer blockbuster this movie fits the bill.

Science Fiction is my favorite genre, but I've never been a fan of superheroes, and in fact, ten years ago I would never have even considered seeing a film like Guardians of The Galaxy. On the surface, this looks like a kids movie, but thanks to some fantastic writing and Peter Quill (Chris Pratt), as interesting a character as you will ever meet, Guardians of The Galaxy is Science Fiction at it's best. Quill is a thief, nothing more, nothing less. He is hired to steal something and does it the same way he's done hundreds of times before, only this time, there are a bunch of other people trying to take it from him. Quill will come to learn that the item is so very valuable because it is a nearly unstoppable weapon, that the worst men in the universe will stop at nothing to possess. Together with the other renegades, Quill decides the best thing to do is to stop these men and make sure the item is never able to be taken again. Chris Pratt stars and gives the performance of a lifetime. I remember first seeing Pratt in the show Everwood, and thinking that this guy has no personality, amazing how things have changed. Finally able to be himself, Pratt shows that his personality is larger than life itself, and twice now in his young career, he has turned that gift into two of the best characters I've seen in years. Paired with some of Hollywood's brightest young stars, an incredible team of writers, and special effects that are out of this world, Guardians of The Galaxy had all the tools it needed to become the companies biggest earner. This is a film that a lot of people are never going to think of as anything more than a comic book turned into a film for children, but it is so much more than that. From the music to the storyline, to the stars themselves, this film has something for everyone, it was my top film pick of 2014, a must see movie, and something that any true fan of cinema shouldn't miss.",

I never felt that edge of seat thing I've had with previous Marvel movies. The story was bland there were no twists or surprises no real character development or REAL back stories  just, \"hey I'm 'this marvel guy' OK lets move story along and show off our quirky personalities and punch lines\".

Clearly my prediction was wrong as it is so perfect it is hard to explain why. It's a story about a group of relatively unknown character set in a relatively unknown setting and is so brilliant for it's ability for the character to run around and not bother with explanations except for one small part in the middle of the movie but it never loses the fast paced story and action. It doesn't have the super awesome super hero fight scenes of The Winter Solider but fills the gap with some awesome star-ship battles and the music which proves that old 70-80s songs can be better than having music the likes of Star Wars. The character are a ragtag band of misfits who take steps to make the film not take it self seriously at some points.

The cast does an outstanding job portraying this band of outlaws without needing separate films providing origin stories. The one gripe I have with this movie is the villain Ronan the Accuser, the name makes him sound very threatening yet I never felt all that threatened by his presence in the movie.

No tengo idea ,el romance entre los dos esta muy forzado, es el mas forzado de cualquier pel\u00edcula de Marvel que haya visto. Otra cosa es que algunos momentos emocionales de los otros personajes son malos, un ejemplo: El mapache se pelea con Batista y entonces dice que el no quer\u00eda que lo crearan y eso intentando que tengamos algo de pena por el. Otro problema es que aqu\u00ed 3 veces intentan que los personajes mueran y queramos que vivan pero TODOS viven al final, eso lo est\u00e1n haciendo muy seguido \u00faltimamente en las pel\u00edculas de Marvel lo cual me hace pensar: \u00bfque pasara si de verdad alguien muere? \u00bfno sentiremos nada cuando muera o asumiremos que revivir\u00e1 o algo as\u00ed?

It wasn't funny enough to be a real comedy, or exciting enough to be an action film, or smart enough to be a drama, etc. etc.  Another issue was that the two computer rendered characters - Rocket Racoon and Groot - stole every scene from the bland/irritating human ones, especially given a highly underwhelming performance by the actors. Last but not least the movie is incessantly peppered with songs that are highly dependent on taste - if you liked them then they probably picked up the film. If you didn't then it just made it all the more tiresome. Ultimately I wouldn't recommend Guardians of the Galaxy, though I suppose it might be okay for a Tuesday showing at a cheap theater.",

Watch it you wont be disappointed. Wonderful and cool and amazing and just beautiful to look at. AWESOME MOVIE!!!!!!!!",

I don't think there were new things that I noticed, but the jokes fell just as well the second time, and it was just as much fun to watch the actions unroll.  Bradley Cooper's raccoon is voiced perfectly, and gives some of the funniest lines of the movie, particularly in his interactions with Groot.  The visual effects and makeup were all interesting and original and really well done; it was neat to see people in red and green and blue, and I like that they didn't go to any trouble explaining history or dynamics, and leaving the audience to mostly tease out the relevant details for themselves.  The ending was a bit predictable in its happy fuzzy feelings and sense of adventure, but it was entirely appropriate to the movie and it worked really well.  Guardians of the Galaxy has some of the best aspects of the comic book movie genre in the neat, creative environment of outer space.  Super fun.",

But other than that all the humor seems to try and force it's way in rather than flowing naturally. A lot of the jokes either make me chuckle very slightly or just fall flat altogether and that's not what I expected. Every time someone told me about this movie they told me how funny it was, how smart it was, and how much fun it was, and it's possible that I had too high expectations before I watched it but even then it still was just decent. Now, I can't really comment on the characters as I haven't read the comic books and don't know how they were written but my god are they boring. Seriously, I enjoyed Bradley Cooper as Rocket but everyone else was so boring! Yes, even Groot! And the story was so rushed I watched it 2 days ago and I barely remember what happened. Also, spoiler alert here but the ending was SO cliche that it was just sad. And the beginning 5 minutes of the movie was just to serve a means to the end of the movie, nothing else. Overall, I don't think this is the worst movie I've seen but it's definitely overrated as hell and shouldn't be praised as much as it should.

The characters are good, the jokes are good, the story is good and the villain is awesome. Even if you think superhero movies are a pain in the neck, you'll probably like this one. 2nd best movie of 2014 (after The Lego Movie)",

The vibe, if not the specifics, is highly reminiscent of The Last Starfighter, Battlestar Galactica, Battle Beyond the Stars, and others.

Even though I was very knowledgeable of the original Marvel universe in the comic lines, I knew nothing about these chracters, therefore i didn't know what to expect. i expected this movie to bomb but once again Marvel had done it. The major highlight of this film was the comedy. Each line made me laugh mostly because the film itself never really took itself that seriously because it knew how absurd the premise was. It is so engrossed in int's world that I didn't care that the film had a raccoon wielding a machine gun and a talking tree who can only say \"I am Groot\". These characters end up to be very compelling as they give their back stories and their personalities are fun to boot. Star Lord is your out of his luck collector, Gamora is the great warrior, Drax is the muscle who doesn't understand figures of speech, Groot is also the muscle, and Rocket is the foul mouth engineer. These chacters are so interesting and so funny that i actually want to sit down and have a cup of coffe with them. The CGI is obvious to spot but the world still felt organic due to the combination of sets as well. James Gunn was the perfect choice of a director since he knows what kind of movie this is and has fun with the premise. In fact he would be a decent replacement for Josh Weadon. Some did mention that Ronin was a lame villain since he wasn't that comedic but I thought it was warranted in order t contrast the humorous personalities of the main team.  The biggest problem with this film though are the times when it takes itself seriously. The scenes are done well but they do produce an emotional whiplash For example, the opening scene had Star lords mother die of cancer and right after that he is abducted by aliens and then hunts for treasure. Another moment like that was when Rockect start to break down but it is after he gets drunk in a comedic fashion.  Despite this though, the film is definitely worth your time and will make you reach for the stars.",
