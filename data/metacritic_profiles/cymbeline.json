      "text": "Micheal Almeryda's Cymbeline is a more action focused vehicle, that shoots the original William Shakespeare play in the stomach and throws in some romantic spice on top. Ed Harris plays the leader of a biker gang called Cymbeline, perfectly. Ethan Hawke, is there....cool, I guess? The acting plays a big part in the film, because this is a more action story driven movie, Milia Jovovich plays the most haunting, \" Cymbeliny\" Queen you will ever see. The story, for the most part is mishmash, cut in pieces and stuck with wafer thin glue, called \"the ending\". But it tries a lot, the action is great when it comes, and the acting is good. Almeryda's passion for Shakepeare shows out in this movie, it dazzles, it's electryfiying in the opening 40 minutes and it has a shocking plot twist. If the bad things can improve, Micheal Almeryda's Cymbeline may be the freshest, most badass Shakepeare film adaptation in years.",
