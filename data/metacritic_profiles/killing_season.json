Who comes up with the idea of having John Travolta play a Serbian and have a battle with Robert De Niro? Honestly, it actually wasn't that bad of an idea but it was just such a slow movie that it made it difficult to watch at times. If this film was any longer I might've fallen asleep. Some of the plot points were a little weak also and Johnny T's accent, while not bad, isn't good enough to make you forget it's John Travolta. Overall, not a terrible movie but pretty mediocre in general.",
