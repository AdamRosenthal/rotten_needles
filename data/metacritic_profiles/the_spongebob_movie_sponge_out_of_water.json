But after the movie, the show started to lose its hilariousness & now the current season just makes me so mad. The Spongebob franchise is like Adam Sandler, its glory days were wonderful, but now I just can't stand it. So I heard this movie has the producers from the first three seasons, the only ones that ever, EVER happened, so is this movie good? Not like I wanted it to be. I saw it in 2D, but I could easilly tell when they went \"Hey! Look at our cool 3D! We're hip!\". It's not 2009 anymore, nobody gives a s*$&t;! Plus,?most of the humor was comparable to Batman & Robin. Yes, I went there. The pirate was annoying & he had seagull buddies which were like Jar Jar Binks, & It wasn't any better than the current season of spongebob. I will admit the last third act was actually better than the first two & I thought the third act was going to be the crappiest part. Other than that, a few chuckles, Tom Kenny, Rob Paulsen, Kevin Michael Richardson, & a cameo by one of my favorite YouTubers were this film's saving grace. Since my rating can't be used for the score, I'll put my rating here & my score above. I give \"Sponge Out of Water\" 1.8 out of 5 stars.",

Really dumb story seemed written by a really young kid. Expected to see much more of the 3-d spongebob  because of trailers but was maybe last 20 minutes. I was actually starting to fall asleep btw part way through. Seems like the theater crowd was forcing laughs. And most importantly just missing some of the elements that makes the cartoon loveable and the ones that were there, were bland and forced. Don't recommend it.",

Y'know that hilarious joke in the trailer where you think Patrick has fallen in love with a woman but he's actually in love with her ice cream? Well in the actual movie they ruin the joke by making it clear that he's looking at the ice cream. Still, the other jokes were hilarious. The bits in Bikini Bottom are the best bits (and thankfully, the majority of the movie takes place there) because the superhero thing in the live action world gets old eventually. It should have just been a one off joke. But if you're a fan of Spongebob, watch this wonderfully silly and crazy movie.",

Pros: Surprisingly enjoyable, offers humor for wide variety of ages, and the bizarre sequences are so outrageous you might think the writers were on some sort of drugs.",

The real problem are the story had 3 differents acts and it dosen't conect with the story. And some of the new characters are really annoying. But it still had that SpongeBob comedy with the return of Hillenburg. And also the animation 2D and 3D are awesome. It just for the most part is 2D and not 3D. Who those one who made the marketing, should be fired. But is still a nice film. I don\u00b4t think is great as the frist one, but is just good for my opinon.",

      "text": "I liked this movie more than I thought i would that does not mean i liked it though. While it was not terrible there are moments I thought should have been left out. This movie is strange to me in that its great in some places but horrible in others. The movie starts off entertaining with a pirate evading raiders of the lost ark style booby traps and starts reading the story of sponge bob to his band of talking seagulls Then we see a food fight against plankton as he is trying to steel the krabby pattty. The movie is on a good streak all the way until sponge bob loses ammo out of a ketchup bottle and it spurts and sponge bob says excuses me like he farted. What? Then this movie is back on its good streak until spongebob breaks out into a very cheesy song about teamwork. Plankton's running joke about not knowing how to say teamwork felt unnecessary and got old quick. Then the movie is on a good streak until we see the part with bubbles the dolphin who has watched over the planets for 10000 years. He shoots spongbob because he let the planets collide. I thought it was an unnecessary scene. There are other instances where i thought this movie had some unssary scenes but those were just some. However some of the jokes worked and It definitly was better than I thought it was going to be but it could have been way better",

The movie is alright; the jokes are not the best but are still quite clever, and the visuals are appealing to both fans of the show and to newcomers. The only con is that the character's visuals during the live action sequences, while they are supposed to look as similar as to the original show, feel an little off to me. Overall, I would personally recommend this movie to children who are familiar of the show.",
