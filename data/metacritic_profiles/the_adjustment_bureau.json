      "text": "In Hirozaku Kore-eda's \"Wandafuru Raifu\", the recently dead get to make a movie that recounts their happiest moment which will play in an endless loop for all of eternity. Heaven is a short film. But before the person makes it to this celluloidal after life, the subject must sit through pre-production meetings conducted by angels, who look about as ordinary as Harry(Anthony Mackie) does, as well as the other fedora-ed men in \"The Adjustment Bureau\". The interview process, in which the vignettes are collected for the subsequent shootings, are held at a sort of way station, a decrepit-looking building that resembles a social services institution, the anti-thesis of the usual iconography associated with heaven. Heaven has an indie aesthetic. Angels with harps, the pearly gates, clouds- those overused tropes are too Hollywood. \"Wandafuru Raifu\", in its eccentric depiction of the hereafter, stood apart from the usual religious genre fare with the truly radical idea that our creator is actually an omnipotent studio head. Heaven is art, seemingly without any ties to organized religion. The same heaven-as-bureaucracy angle is also prevalent in \"The Adjustment Bureau\", where heaven has an annex on Earth which looks conspicuously like an insurance company building. When David Norris(Matt Damon) discovers that the world is being micro-managed by \"case workers\"(read: angels), then defies their grand plans for him by his insistence on pursuing Elise(Emily Blunt), a woman he was supposed to meet just once, the men in hats \"kick\" the case \"upstairs\". The \"chairman\"(read: God) send down an archangel-type named Thompson(Terrence Stamp), who informs the senator hopeful that free-will doesn't exist, only the appearance of it. The men who work for the Adjustment Bureau function as architects of predestination. In the Kore-eda film, free will, likewise, turns out to be an illusion, as well, since the movie that the people are collaborating with god on requires a script. A script suggests that everything is written out ahead of time, a collection of life experiences that has a beginning, a middle, and an end. For David, his happiest memory(were he an interviewee in \"Wandafuru Raifu\") may very well be the moment he says, \"I love you,\" to Elise on the rooftop, kissing his muse as if it was for the last time, so he kisses her hard, while the bureaucrats approach the couple with the intent of \"resetting\" their mental faculties. Prior to being trapped on the terrace overlooking New York City, the fleeting lovers, in a sense, make their own movie, as they ingress into new locales with each turn of the knob, like editors, surveying the city in the blink of an eye. Their whirlwind jaunt through the urban landscape can be construed as a metaphor for how love has its own velocity when you're with the one you love. Whipping through Yankee Stadium, Times Square, and Ellis Island, time seems to move too fast. Time just slips away. Time passes you by. If David and Elise kiss each other deeply enough, the future amnesiacs hope that perhaps some vestige of their affinity for each other will survive. Maybe they'll find each other, similar to how Joel Barish(Jim Carrey) and Clementine Kruczynski(Kate Winslet) think they're meeting for the first time on that train to Montauk at the outset of Michel Gondry's \"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\". Lucky for the politician and the dancer, but unlucky for the fortunes of the film, their undying love never gets tested, because \"the chairman\" is a Judeo-Christian figure, whereas in the Gondry film, traces of Buddhism can be detected in the way the victimized Lacuna customers are able to recognize each other, which subtly suggests reincarnation, a concept commonly associated with eastern religions. The ending to \"The Adjustment Bureau\", in what is otherwise an entertaining mish-mash of reasonably sophisticated sci-fi and high romance, is sort of a cheat(or maybe not). God is perfect, right? Hypothetically, when does God ever change his mind? In Carl Reiner's \"Oh, God\", George Burns, playing our heavenly father, admits to making the pits in avocados too big, but he lets the imperfection remain as is. After forty years of presiding over earth under a working predestination model, now the chairman wants to give free will one more try? C'mon, now. The last time people were entrusted with free will, as previously stated earlier in the film by Thompson, the Cuban Missile Crisis occurred, bringing the world to the brink of nuclear war. What if God didn't issue this edict? When Harry is summoned to the Chairman's chambers, what if the angel staged a coup, and took over the reigns of power? Maybe the Salon writer is right. Maybe Harry is the devil.",

It's far from straightforward, rather Inception like but it extremely throught-provking and engages you all the while. There are plenty of surprising twists and turns throughout in this thriller and the performances of Damon and Mad Men's John Slattery and Anthony Mackie however it's far from perfect. Their are plenty of flaws along the way but overall it is a fresh and fairly entertaining movie that provides thrills and excitement, not for everyone but a worthwhile watch nonetheless!",

      "text": "Big screen adaptations of Philip K. Dick stories have been a staple of Hollywood filmmaking for 30 years. Rarely completely faithful to Dick's source material, they are of hugely differing quality, ranging from the exceptional (Blade Runner, Minority Report) to the decent (Total Recall) to the so-so (A Scanner Darkly). The Adjustment Bureau undoubtedly belongs in the latter category. The story is relatively engaging at first, with some interesting concepts and a hugely likeable on-screen pairing in Matt Damon and Emily Blunt. There are also some interesting set pieces throughout, with special effects used sparingly but effectively. Unfortunately the film falls completely flat in the last twenty minutes or so (despite this point in the film including a very slick and entertaining chase sequence), the story simply runs out of steam and tries to tie everything up as quickly as possible. The most irritating thing about the film's final act is that you've been waiting for some shocking revelation, a final blow to give the film a satisfying conclusion, but this never comes. It just...ends. The ideas that string the film together also feel a little inconsistent, illogical and at times lazy (attributing everything from intellectual enlightenment to world wars and genocide to angels in suits and fedoras in one sweeping statement is a little too absurd a concept even in a sci-fi film). The Adjustment Bureau works best as a romance, and you sometimes find yourself wishing it was simply a film about a congressman and a dancer trying to balance their careers and personal lives in a busy city. The film does have this plotline, but also has some silly \"fate-police\" getting in the way of the interesting stuff, which is always David and Elise's relationship. Despite a good premise, and two strong central performances from Damon and Blunt, The Adjustment Bureau gets bogged down with its ill-defined science-fiction elements, and cliched debates about fate and free will. Not even the icy cool charisma of Terrance Stamp can save the Adjustment Bureau from mediocrity.",

My only problem with the plot is how much caution Blunt's character throws to the wind to be with Damon's character at the end of the film; it just seemed a bit unrealistic for her to trust him THAT much.

As noted above the end chase is thrilling and well directed allowing the viewer to really feel the adrenaline and fear in the moment. The only downside really is the actual ending which doesn't really live up to the rest of the film which is well paced.

But the movie does not look or feel like anything else, something that cannot be taken for granted in a time when even original sci-fi ideas feel wrung out and hollow. It's sci-fi for romantics and believers, something Dick might have scoffed at but more than welcome before the next dystopian apocalypse film comes along.",
