I enjoyed every minute of it.  Greta Gerwig could be considered the Diane Keaton of this generation. She was wonderful in \"Maggie's Plan.\" So was Ethan Hawke and the rest of the supporting cast, including Bill Hader, Julianne Moore, Maya Rudolph, and Travis Fimmel (whom I am not familiar with) as the potential sperm donor. Loved the NYC setting, too. It reminded me of a good Woody Allen-type story, so if you like that sort of thing, you will like this, too.",

Meryl Streep better watch out if Julianne Moore decides to give her a run for believable accents and Moore should insist that Malgopsia Turzanska never be the costume designer on any of her future movies.",

      "text": "Once more, Greta Gerwig finds herself as a lost, naive, and unsure 20 something living in New York City. As typical, Maggie's Plan is an interesting little indie dramedy in which Gerwig turns in a very good performance. Though her characters are becoming quite one note at this point, her ability to pull off the role is undeniable. Plus, she is well matched here by Ethan Hawke who plays a self-absorbed and unethical man that seemingly cannot control his sexual urges. Julianne Moore, however, steals the show as his foreign and experienced wife. Together, these actors help bring to life this charming, heartbreaking, and thoroughly relatable tale of love and marriage. Though quite the typical indie dramedy, writer/director Rebecca Miller breathes some new life into its conventions with this thoroughly odd and off-kilter story, plus conjuring great chemistry between her actors. The film is both family and touching, while also being thoroughly engaging. Overall, Maggie's Plan works, though typical in its blend of comedy with serious life occurrences.",

      "text": "The silly season is not lifted one iota by this critically lauded, but extremely overrated comedy- drama.  Comparisons can be made to a bad Woody Allen outing in so much as the film is set in New York and has a very verbose script, but similarities end there. Whereas Allen at his best employs great actors in good stories this verbiage finally adds up to nothing more than pretentious drivel. Despite a good start with early scenes promising an Art house level of sophisticated articulation, it\u2019s not long before the eyes glaze over, the ears tune out and one is left to endure a bunch of uninteresting characters espousing little more than blah, blah, blah. All three leads are not at their best. Greta Gerwig is still Greta who? Julianne Moore continues to lose her edge in yet another downward spiral performance and even Ethan Hawke is the weakest he\u2019s been for years. In fact, it is the supporting turn of Bill Hader that impresses most as Gerwig\u2019s \u2018say it as it is\u2019 best friend. Ultimately the film is neither funny nor dramatic enough to make one care about any of these tiresome characters and their predicaments are totally uninvolving. As for the jolly incidental music, this is just another irritating aspect of a small and insignificantly forgettable film.",

I knew in the first five minutes how it would end, and that predictable ending is really unforgivable. SPOILER: Could a movie end with a single woman happily raising a child by herself, for once? Apparently not. Other turnoffs for me: the two married best friends, who of course are adorable and happy together -- such a cliche. Also, I'm a NYC professor, and let me tell you, no one has apartments like that who isn't born with a silver spoon like Donald Trump, and would never say things like \"No one unpacks commodity fetishism like you do.\" Please. For some reason, movies never get the way professors really talk -- if anything, they bend over backwards to avoid being seen as pretentious, so they're more likely to speak self-deprecatingly or ironically/ jokingly --they would never say something like that seriously. Altogether, the movie seemed as fake and contrived as could be,, except that I did enjoy the way the couple acted when their marriage began to go downhill. \"Do you want to hear your horoscope?\" \"Um, no.\" Now that has a ring of truth -- but I can't say the same for most of the movie.",

Gerwig is so believable and another's reviewers comparison to Woody Allen-era Diane Keaton are spot on. Not that she's a Keaton clone, she's comes across so sincere and really wanting to do the right thing, but things just don't work out. The few pieces of music fit in so perfectly (altho I\"ve always hated Bruce Springsteen, I actually found my self liking Dancing in the Dark in the one scene with the bar band version.) There are obscure reggae cuts that feel so right and so great in the movie.  The scenes  involving her children are heartbreakingly  adorable. And the kids are so adorable....whatever Maggie's  Plan was, the results are these kids who have the most wonderful(seemed to be using that word alot) rapport with Gerwig.. Juliane Moore is great as the ice queen who turns out to be not so icy after all. This was my favorite movie so far this year. OK I'm not the greatest at telling you why, but PLEASE see this movie.  This movie deserves a bigger audience(I saw it in an audience of three people) and I wish this would be come a huge suprise hit. It won't, and that will be alot of people's bad luck, because Maggie's Plan is (sorry) WONDERFUL. There's just no other word that does it.",
