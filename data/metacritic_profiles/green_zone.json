      "text": "Paul Greengrass up until around 2001 no one knew whom this Irish up and coming director was that is until he directed the second of the three Bourne films \"The Bourne Supremacy\"(2004) that became the highest grossing film for the series at that point. one of Greengrass' most critically acclaimed films following on the heels of  his universally acclaimed \"Bloody Sunday\"(2002). Three years later  Greengrass directed one of the last decades   most acclaimed  and most controversial films \"United 93\"(2006) based on the true story of the heroism of the passengers and there tragic death when they forced the plane into a nose dive  causing it  to crash near Shanksville, Pennsylvania. The film was a massive critical success but meet with extreme criticism form audiences alike over its touchy source material. The year after Greengrass and actor Matt Damon  re-teamed to star and direct the third(and possibly final installment)  of the hugely successful Bourne series  with  the \"Bourne Ultimatum\"(2007)  which proved to be the highest grossing and biggest critically acclaimed hit of the series bringing a crashing final close to the saga of Jason Bourne. For nearly three years Greengrass was  working on a new project that while may lack the enthusiasm of his early works  is no less thought provoking or  thrilling as his  earlier works. This film is one of his best and a film that not only gives you the views of why we go to war but if the reasons we do go to war are really for the right reasons.  When I first heard of Paul Greengrass'  \"Green Zone\" back in  late 2009   I can say that I was  extremely excited  to see  Greengrass and Damon  back together again making a big action picture again  I could almost picture how this film would  have played out in my head(no thanks to my limitless imagination). I saw Damon playing a solider fighting against another Government conspiracy involving some sort of political assassination or cover up  that he exposed. I was eager with anticipation however, when I found out the release date of this film my anticipation dwindled. It dwindled not because I found out the film might not be as good as it appears but it dwindled because I would have to wait three months into 2010 to see one of my most anticipated films of 2010. After nearly two months of waiting I finally was able to see Paul Greengrass' \"Green Zone\u00e2",

Like all of Paul Greengrass's work, it looks great,  the audience is dragged right into the heart of the action, and the hellish images of war-torn Iraq are quite effective. The cast's performances are relatively decent, but by no means exceptional. The only one who really stands out is Khalid Abdalla, who plays \"Freddie\", an Iraqi ex-soldier and amputee who helps Chief Miller (Damon) to unravel the mystery as to why intelligence on WMD is so unreliable, and why the US went to war in the first place. Abdalla's performance is head-and-shoulders above the rest of the cast - it's complex, emotional and moving. Where Green Zone fails is in its writing, and in the fact that for a political thriller, it  has a surprising lack of thrills. While Brian Helgeland's screenplay is perfectly reasonable on face value, it simply isn't brave or clever enough. Instead of having the courage to point the finger of blame for the Iraq War at the real culprits, Helgeland instead chooses to substitute real-world villains with Hollywood creations (Greg Kinnear's morally dubious Pentagon man and Jason Isaacs' brutal handlebar-moustached spec ops commander). While I understand the need for dramatic licence to make a film work as a piece of entertainment (it is not, after all, an informative documentary) I don't understand how Kinnear and Issacs' characters turned out so dull. The real masterminds behind the Iraq war, the politicians that duped us all into thinking there was some sort of justification behind invading Iraq are far more interesting characters than these screen creations, and ultimately far more evil. If only Greengrass and Helgeland had the courage to say something really divisive about the Iraq War, rather than just re-affirming what we already know, that the WMD intelligence was made up, a convenient excuse for toppling an oppressive dictatorship. Even with this unremarkable underlying message, the film could have still stood out if had a decent plot, something to rival the truly great Hollywood conspiracy thrillers. Unfortunately, the story is simple and linear, and you can see the only major twist a mile off. Technically, Green Zone is flawless, and you really feel like you're going into Baghdad with the American soldiers, and living and fighting alongside them - Greengrass is a master of establishing, then maintaining a particular tone in his films. The high-quality cast all do their job, but the only one to really stand out is the excellent Khalid Abdalla, and the filmmakers' characterisation can come across as a little lazy. Greenzone's main problem is that it has not approached its highly controversial subject matter with enough commitment or bravery - nothing new is said, and it doesn't leave you thinking at the end, just non-plussed. Paul Greengrass's latest film is competent but uninspired, diverting but not memorable - in short, nothing special. His Bourne films had far more to say about evil politicians, shady military operations and human rights infringement than Green Zone ever does.",

      "text": "Green Zone is a terrific film that may take some creative liberties at times, but is always incredibly well paced,  edge of your seat thrilling, and a fantastic look at the Iraq War from the inside. Matt Damon is great in this role as a soldier who quickly realizes their intel is bad and Iraq has no WMDs. Tense and thrilling, there are rarely films nowadays that leave me on the edge of my seat, but Green Zone made me think I was going to have a heart attack - it was that thrilling and energizing. The film, politically, has been criticized as \"anti-American\". I am not seeing it. If anything, it is pro-understanding. Those who try to learn more instead of sticking their head in the sand are rewarded. Those who put down dissenters are villains. That said, the film's simple point of, only Iraqis should run Iraq is very well built up to and a fair point. With so many factions in Iraq, nobody is better equipped to handle running the country than them. We certainly know that now. As for Green Zone, it is a terrifically entertaining and thrilling action war film that is wonderfully directed by Paul Greengrass and his action muse Matt Damon.",

It's a well thought-out film with a great actor and director who have obvious chemistry, especially when producing these similar military-based films. Perhaps just a little bit more action was required to make this a truly great film.",

      "text": "In my opinion Green Zone is a good movie. It features more a political aspect compared to other movies in its genre, so if you watch Green Zone expecting an action packed-thriller then you will be slightly disappointed. Instead it focuses on important issues that cause you think about the world we live in today and our involvement in the war abroad. In Green Zone, the movie shines a light on the US government and its involvement in Iraq. More closely its search for \"weapons of mass destruction\". With Matt Damon as the protagonist, he begins to question his chain of command, and the mission at hand. With an underlying political aspect, the plot unravels and at the end, your wanting more.",

      "text": "Green Zone works well as a war thriller, caught up with major real life conflicts. But, the pace is slow, the writing is dull, and that makes for a longer experience than usual. Director Paul Greengrass throws everything at it, to make viewers grasp its attention, but by that time, it's too late. Greengrass, who brought us the brilliant Captain Philips and the Bourne movies, comes up with a dull, lukewarm thriller about the chemical ramblings in Pakistan. Matt Damon, does well with what he is given. But not much is given. If you expect action, there are a few scenes, that do well to get your attention. But by then, you're already asleep.",

It's story is typical and predictable, and sure Matt Damon does a good job as his character but the performances as a whole are pretty \"meh\". The film is simply this: is a typical middle eastern war film that doesn't bring anythinf special other than Matt Damon. A pretty easily missable film.",
