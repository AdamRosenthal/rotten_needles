Sure, an umanned, speeding train is exciting, but after, say...half an hour, you start to get the point: CGI action shots amidst sub-par acting; what else is new. The only breath of fresh air, albeit a quick one, comes from Washington, who although doesn't quite bring the fire he used to, still can \"act\" more convincingly than the entire cast combined; and do so with little to no effort. The final verdict: \"Unstoppable\" is a fast-paced, popcorn-eque action thriller that doesn't have the meat and potatoes to make a film with much to offer. If you are looking for a quick film to fill some time for something later, it's great. Although, if you were actually heading to the theaters to take something away from it, you're better off getting some carry-out and a cheap 24-hour rental. What will it be?",

      "text": "The man from the railroad safety campaign knows something about the cargo on the train, the conductorless locomotive that's headed toward a densely populated Pennsylvania city. Molten phenol, according to the visitor, is used in the manufacturing of glue, and naturally, since we're not on \"The Darjeeling Limited\"(nothing blows up in the 2007 Wes Anderson film), the 777 has the potential to blow s*it up, due to its high combustibility factor. \"Can we trust him?\" asks Galvin(Kevin Dunn), a corporate higher-up who was speaking to Connie(Rosario Dawson), the train yardmaster, before the happenstantial straggler put in his two cents on the impending crisis at hand. \"In a perfect world,\" responds the woman in charge, and since the unsolicited information that the third party offers is right on the money, these Pennsylvanians, for all intents and purposes, live in a de facto perfect world, where racial differentiation never rears its ugly head. When Connie makes the recommendation that the runaway train be derailed before it reaches a town, a decision which could cost AWWR millions of dollars and precipitate their stock price to nosedive, in an imperfect world, the real world, a racist slip(Connie is non-white) by her supervisor would not be all that surprising, but Galvin, despite being furious with his subordinate for suggesting a plan that's antithetical to business, remains civil throughout the ordeal, without a trace of prejudicial animosity in his voice. This ethnic variance is a pattern, duplicated through the pairing of Frank Barnes(Denzel Washington), the railway old-timer, and the rookie Will Colson(Chris Pine), a situation that's ripe for racial tension, since the \"retiring\" conductor is assigned with the unenviable task of training his replacement. The warfare in question seems wholly steeped in class, not race, in which Frank objects to Will's blue blood(and all the privileges that money buys you), not white blood. After all, he works in an integrated trainyard; his best buddies are white, and even more importantly, old, and these like-minded veterans have even less patience with the new kid on the block than their black friend, who ironically, is the more open-minded one. In another economic climate, the new kid on the block might be black, but \"Unstoppable\" is a sign of the times, in which working class whites(like Frank's friends), stung repeatedly by the voraciousness of the corporate machine, would now feel more malice towards the rich than a black man. Frank keeps the peace when the two sides trade barbs about each other's respective generations; he accepts Will's hand when the union \"punk\" introduces himself. Out on the tracks, the widower father tells Will that his two daughters work at a Hooters(another example of seamless integration), not minding the dirty thoughts which may form in his trainee's mind about the barely legal girls. The world of \"Unstoppable\" is practically utopian, a \"perfect world\" as Connie suggests, in the sense that a racial divide doesn't seem to exist. Once the train passes the pastures and corporate headquarters realizes that derailment is the only option available, and the towns of Arkow and Stanton, the two potential destinations for a catastrophic explosion, in an imperfect world, our world, would be determined on the basis of color, not size. But AWWR is not FEMA, and John Galvin is not our former president. Since neither Arkow and the more densely populated Stanton are bastions for a predominantly black or white demographic, Frank and Will are free to banter.",

Rosario Dawson too, is perfect and fresh in her role, effectively representing the voice of reason.  All three are likeable despite very little backstory and demand real empathy from the audience.

Just last year, Scott urged Denzel Washington into the train robbery for THE TAKING OF PELHAM 1 2 3, with John Travolta. Now, he brought up a true event in 2001, when unmanned raging train that carrying tons of toxic chemical sliding wildly out of control without air brake and it is totally unstoppable. I have to say, thiz movie is in a very good story-telling. It reminds me of how old-time action movies pump up our adrenaline where the event is occurring only in a few hours long, like in: DIE HARD (1988) or SPEED (1994). Tony Scott who is the brother of Ridley Scott (also Director) always knows how to make a precise recipe of good Action Movies. If you want to search for drama, Ridley is the man. But if you want to experience some good actions, you find Tony, like what he did in TOP GUN (1986) and my favorite TRUE ROMANCE (1993). It starts slow with problematic introduction, and then, as the Train goes faster, the tension goes greater as well. Scott pins down a suitable direction for each of its technical aspects. The sounds are so rich and realistic, you can actually feel the threaten train is chugging and rushing in front of your seat. And the hand -shake camera simply drags you into the center of situation, and forces you to think along how to solve the complication. The camera work and movement is really effective and outstanding. In the same direction, all Casts are in good shape. Everyone can deliver a believable working-class presentation. The costume and make-up support that completely.  It seems to me, it is a piece of cake for Denzel, to merge into thiz kind of movie. And our Star Trek new Capt. Kirk, Chris Pine can eventually bring balance into their interaction. Rosario Dawson also shows significant existence of her supporting role. Maybe the story has been exaggerated and dramatized to make it more interesting. Like it or not, Scott has created one great vessel of effective high-octane action with his own way. Like on the movie, the train company executive once said, It is my train! It is my decision!",

      "text": "In Tony Scott's third straight feature starring Denzel Washington, he takes a look at an incident that occurred 3 years prior in Ohio. The event was nowhere near the magnitude seen in Unstoppable, but it defiantly put lives at risk, and put people to the test. The story follows an incident with a runaway train and the two men who risk everything to save lives from it's dangerous cargo. Washington is terrific as always, thriving in these unsung hero roles. Chris Pine, the virtual newcomer who  plays the rookie, on his first day of work, is also really good and shows the potential for a strong film career. While it's not going to surprise or shock anyone, Unstoppable was fast paced, visually impactful, and very entertaining.",
