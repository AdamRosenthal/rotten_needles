I'm a big fan of his work and one of the greatest talented artists since he has millions of followers on Twitter. But there's no need for another concert movie in 3-D. The new \"Believe\" music documentary feels a bit short and can't outmatch his success in 2011's \"Never Say Never\" (which is also the name of the title track featuring his best friend Jaden Smith from \"The Karate Kid\"). I thought the film has a lot of great music but the behind-the-scenes features and revealing secrets of his troubled life just couldn't even make the Beliebers even more special and I think the film just wasted too much publicity when it comes to stars who are turning into a darker path of destruction. But I hope 2014 could fix all the problems Justin needs, maybe counseling might do the trick (just don't give plenty of advices from Will Smith). Not a good documentary to wipe a tear to end the year, but trust me Justin can still deliver the fans what they want. So I prefer a rental for \"Believe.\".",
