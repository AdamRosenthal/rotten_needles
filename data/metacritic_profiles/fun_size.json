Victoria's feature film debut in \"Fun Size\" is just not what the parents wanted the kids to see. I'm tired of the new Nickelodeon. Now that I don't watch the network anymore and since this is a PG-13 rated movie (the first was The Last Airbender), I'm gonna be sick if Nickelodeon had skipped out of the family-friendly business with classic Nicktoons and stuff. \"Fun Size\" is one of the worst movies and bombs since \"Hey Arnold\" and \"The Last Airbender.\"",

Admittedly I enjoyed the movie (I'm around the age of the target audience) but sometimes the humor sinks into areas only the most immature of us can enjoy (fart jokes, ugh!). At times it can come across as a toned down version of Project X, but other times it can be much more juvenile. It stands in that awkward area between kids movies and adult movies, that's right the teen movie area. An area that has always been a little awkward for movies to find a footing in.
