Also the movie has a few funny moments with Nathan Kress (icarly) being a funny like able character as well as the redneck dynamic duo who offer a few laughs as well. Overall I liked the characters but the main reason to see this movie is the special effects and destruction this movie has. These tornados are killers and they destroy everything from planes, oil tankers, schools and of course houses and cities. This movie has the best looking tornados I've ever seen! They are terrifyingly real looking!

But, it doesn't mean its good though. Steven Quale directs this film about people who get trapped inside a mind bending storm. The characters are something you don't care about in this movie. In fact you don't care about anything except the storm itself, destruction and the damn awesome special effects. This movie isn't excellent. Believe me. But it's good enough to keep you on the edge of your seat. Into The Storm is a gut wrenching ride. It's worth watching in IMAX 3D.",

Sure, the CGI in the tornadoes was miles better than Twister but the story and acting, if anything, was worse. And, once again, we have twisters appearing out of thin air at the bottom of stratus clouds and radar readings that show just nondescript cluster storms, moving in the WRONG DIRECTION. Their storms were heading SOUTHWEST in their screens. It wouldn't have taken much to get it right with the right consulting. The only storm that looked almost right was the first one and it looked as thought they ripped off the footage from a copter cam of a storm a few years ago.

The first surprise is that Max Deacon, who plays one of the main characters named Donnie, carries the film from an acting perspective. Sarah Wayne Callies was marketed as the big get but Max Deacon steals the show. The second surprise was how well the special effects were, especially considering the relatively modest $50 million budget. Also, the shorter duration of 89 minutes didn't prevent Steven Quale from delivering plenty of character development. Actually, I'd say the shorter time helped the movie as it was able to dive into the action fairly quickly and make for almost a beginning to end, edge-of-your-seat tornado thriller. Lastly, and maybe the biggest surprise of all, the movie was very funny. Jon Reep and Kyle Davis, playing stereotypical rednecks named Reevis and Donk, respectively, added a great deal of comedic relief and the timing for their wacky humor was perfect and contrasted with the devastation of the town around them well. There were still some flaws. There was a void of anything scientific whatsoever, which is something that Twister, a film that all tornado movies are compared against, at least attempted. There also was a missed opportunity on some of the emotion. I thought this last bit could've made the movie leap from exciting and somewhat terrifying nature environmental thriller to deep and insightful catastrophe movie. A leap almost all of the movies in this genre seem to fail at achieving. Nonetheless, I felt that it was more than worth my time.",

Twister was the story of storm chasers, trying to beat another team to the punch in getting data from inside a tornado. Into The Storm also has storm chasers, but they're only a part of the story, as it also features the town caught in a super storm, and a family caught in the middle. If you want to compare this film to twister, simply because of tornadoes and storm chasers you can, but Into The Storm still wins, as it features a better background story, better special effects, and is overall much more intense. Richard Armitage stars as the High School's assistant principle, that goes into the storm to find his missing son, and save other people in the path. While the British Actor isn't known for anything more than The Hobbit, he showed real intensity and fortitude, making the film so much more exciting. He's paired with storm chaser turned rescuer, Sarah Wayne Callies, best known for her roles in Prison Break and The Walking Dead. Callies usual plays the strong female character with great ideas, the leaders right hand if you will. In this film however she is little more than a follower, leading to a performance that wasn't nearly as good as I thought it would be. When you have a film with the popularity of Twister, anything else that features anything even remotely similar is going to be compared to that film and ultimately called a rip off, and parts of it could be considered that. When watching the film and now reflecting on it, I prefer to think of it as updating a great idea with a new cast, story, and effects. You are free to disagree and if you're one of those people who think of it as just another rip off, I'd still recommend seeing it for the special effects, if nothing else.",

They're great. The tornados look and feel real (when I say feel, watch the movie with a high-end speaker system and you'll see). Of course there are the storm chasers, but there are also other story lines. There's a family story and then there's the two idiots running around trying to become famous on the internet. You'll either love them or hate them. Overall it was an ok movie. VERY INTENSE. This is the kind of movie that doesn't let up and keeps you on the edge of your seat. The story is very predictable. Like I said, its Twister 2. Its all about a storm system thats the biggest the state has ever seen (sound familiar). There's an eventual F-5 and bla bla bla.

The script was stiff and the acting was stiff also. Not to be overly critical of the cast on unknowns but I didm't feel a connection with any of them which is strange for me because there is usually someone in a film I can identify with.
