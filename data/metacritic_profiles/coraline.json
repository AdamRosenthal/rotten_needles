He realized the reasons storytelling have been significantly important since the dawn of mankind, and devised, as the Brothers Grimm did, that fairy tales and children's stories had to be haunting and entertaining to be both memorable and timeless. This is a great film depicting the growing sense as a child approaches adolescence that their parents and their world aren't exactly as they seem, and that through their trials and tribulations (the 'rites of passage', if you will) they'll reach the 'happy medium' they need to in order to find true happiness in their lifetimes.",

She was forced to move away from all her friends and live in the Pink Palace. From there she faces challenges but meets new friends along the way. Laika is the company that produced  this movie. We thought Henry Selick (the director) and Laika did a great job making this movie happen.    \u201cCoraline\u201d took place in the Pink Palace Apartments where she found a magical doorway that leads to an alternative, better world. In the other world she meets improved versions of the people she knows, such as her parents. Everything in that world is how she wants her life to be. This world ended up being pretty dangerous for Coraline. Coraline struggles to find her way and learns to appreciate what she has and not what she wants. We liked the stop motion animation in this movie and appreciate how long it takes to do it. We also liked all the characters such as Coraline, Wybie, Bobinsky, and the Black Cat. One of our favorite scenes in the middle of the movie was about one of the many wonders, the other father\u2019s garden. The beautiful flowers seem to come to life as she walks through the garden. One of our least favorite scenes from the movie is when she had to throw the black cat to escape one of the many dangers. Overall, we all think that this movie is really good. This movie is PG, but we think that a certain age group should watch it. It could be hard for little kids to understand and it will most likely scare them. We recommend ages 10 and up so they will be understand the actual storyline. We also don\u2019t recommend this movie to adults, but it is still good for all age groups. Overall this movie is pretty good but is hard to understand the plot and the message that goes with it.",

I don\u2019t know if I can say I liked the plot to \u201cCoraline.\u201d It seemed all over the place at the end, with Coraline making a bet and having to defeat the villain twice, and it kind of lost it\u2019s creepy tone for a while. It also seemed too scary for their target audience. You have to give Laika Entertainment credit for its stop-motion, though. It was smooth for the most part and their character and set designs were great. The movie also had a great message about loving your family so that would be a plus.    While the rating, PG, suggests that this movie might be good for little kids, I think it should be a PG-13 rating. With a woman begging to be loved and stealing the souls of innocent children, \u201cCoraline\u201d can be creepy at times and might be a little scary for young children. The \u201cother\u201d dimension characters come off as almost lifeless towards the end, one even tells Coraline about their suffering. I wouldn\u2019t say this movie was bad, but it wasn\u2019t great either.",

      "text": "If you\u2019re looking for a movie that has laughs for adults and a spook for younger viewers Coraline is the movie for you. In 2009 the movie Coraline was made by Laika Entertainment. I just watched the movie for a school project. The movie Coraline is based off a book made by Neil Gaiman. Coraline the main character is played by Dakota Fanning. The main character in this movie is Coraline and the supporting characters are Wybie (Wyborn), Bobinsky, Coraline\u2019s other and real mother and father, the cat, and the 2 woman that live in the basement. Coraline, a girl from Michigan, has made the move to the Pink Palace Apartments in Oregon for her parent\u2019s job. While the Jones family believed their life would continue to be bland and routine, Coraline opens the door to secrets and a whole lot of problems.  While Coraline wonders the house counting squeaky doors, leaky windows, and odd paintings she finds a locked, knee high door in the family room. Making a deal with her mom she unlocks the door, to find bricks and the door blocked off. With help from mice she\u2019s welcomed into the alternate world with open arms from her other mother and father. The first visit Coraline realized that while everything was the same, one main difference stood out, the buttons on the eyes of her alternate parents. Coraline, continues to visit the alternate world but begins to get a more eerie vibe with each visit. With Coraline\u2019s other mother trying to love her forever, will Coraline give into the other world\u2019s temptations? Some of the things we liked was the stop motion filming and unique story line. The other mother was a very strong character and the movie centered around her and the world she created. I feel like Wybie was a key character in the movie but never fully developed. I also believe that while the main focus was on Coraline\u2019s other parents, there was not enough screen time of her real parents to get a full feel for Coraline\u2019s home life. The characters were played very well by the actors behind them, and helped really tie the movie together. While there were many positives, I believe the movie was inappropriate for the age group it is advertised in. With scandalous content in the scene with Forcible and Spink\u2019s performance in the alternate world and an alarming plot with characters who change for the worst the movie is not as family friendly as it is portrayed.   I would recommend this movie to people who are into an eerie vibe. Parents may want to view the movie before their children.With the possibility of nightmares from characters who change to be creepy and scenes that include jump scares I don\u2019t recommend this for anyone younger than 7. The MPAA rating of this movie is PG, and despite its rating I would recommend it for ages 8 and up. Rating out of 5 stars:",

With Dakota Fanning as Coraline, Teri Hatcher as Coraline\u2019s mother, John Hodgman was Coraline\u2019s dad, Ian McShane as Mr. Bobinsky, Jennifer Saunders as Mrs.S, Dawn French as Mrs.F, and Robert Bailey Jr. as Wybie. A young girl named Coraline from Michigan moves into the Pink Palace in Oregon, with some crazy neighbors (Mr. Bobinsky, Mrs. P, and Mrs. F), and a wandering boy named Wybie. When her mom ignores her and her dad tells her to explore the house, she finds a door hidden within the wallpaper. She annoys her mom until her mom unlocks the door, only to find bricks. In disappointment, she falls asleep then some mice wake her up and lead her to the same door. She opens it and and there is a magical tunnel that leads to a new and better world, where she is given a gift to her imagination. Where Her other mother wants to love her and everything in her life is just better, or is it really.",

This film is a stop-motion animated movie from Laika Entertainment. The main character, a young girl named Coraline is trying to find something fun to do because her parents are strict and ignore her. Coraline\u2019s friend Wybie isn\u2019t allowed into the Pink Palace because his Grandma, the owner, doesn\u2019t want him to go missing like her sister. Wybie gives her a creepy doll that he found in her grandma\u2019s car. This particular doll was made to look just like Coraline.  Coraline finds a portal through a small door in her apartment, hidden behind a shelf. Through that portal she shall find an alternate reality. She receives many warnings from Mr. Bobinsky, her neighbor, not to go back. She doesn\u2019t listen to any of the warnings.

This scene was inappropriate for the PG rating. One thing I didn\u2019t like was how the stop-motion was so choppy. This made the movie unrealistic and unnatural. The movie might have been able to go for PG-13 but that may be a little high. The movie is more towards the age group of 8 to 10 year olds.

      "text": "You will get lost in the movie \u201cCoraline\u201d \u201cCoraline\u201d will take you to a magical new world. The dark fantasy novella \u201cCoraline\u201d, written by Neil Gaiman, was developed for the screen and adapted by the screen by Henry Selik. Created in 2009 by Laika Entertainment, it is a fantasy thriller and is one hour and forty minutes long. Eleven year old Coraline Jones isn\u2019t happy with her new life in Pink Palace Apartments. Her new house is dingy and falling apart, and there seems to be no one her age around, besides a weird boy named Wybie and his stray cat. Worst of all, her parents, especially her mom, seem not to care about anything Coraline does. When Coraline discovers a strange hidden door in their living room, she is thrilled to leave her boring and run down life. The door takes her into an alternate version of her world, one that gives Coraline everything she has ever wanted, including the \u2018Other Mother\u2019 that treats her as a princess. After several visits to the Other World and mysterious warnings from her eccentric neighbors, Coraline starts to question whether this \u2018perfect world\u2019 holds a dark and sinister secret.  \u201cCoraline\u201d was an incredibly detailed stop-motion film. The dark fairy tale style of the animation really caught my eye. Coraline, Other Mother, and the other characters were detailed and each had their own, distinct personality.The intricate plot will keep entertained and anxious for what comes next, although it may be too complex for young viewers to fully understand the film. Some scenes may also be scary for children younger than 7.  \u201cCoraline\u201d conveys the message to children and parents to appreciate one another. I would recommend this movie to children above the age of ten. The MPAA rating is PG, but some scary scenes and the intense plot may not be suitable for younger kids. Overall, I felt that this movie was extremely creative and unique.  Our Rating 3.5 out of 5 stars.",

The animation style  in this movie is amazing it goes it extreme detail. This movie isn\u2019t really appropriate for younger kids but if kid enjoys creepy Tim Burton Movies then they would enjoy this movie. Laika Entertainment once again made a genius movie for people wanting to watch animated movies that are gloomy.",

I thought that this was a movie that is different from most other movies that I have seen. \u201cCoraline\u201d has a very eventful storyline, it gives off a sort of dark feeling and leaves you in suspense throughout the whole movie. Laika Entertainment also did a great job in casting as well.",
