After Pixar excellent pieces in the 90s and 00s, as well as the Shrek series, you would have thought that the era of purely child-oriented, one-dimensional, cheesy fairy tale princess stories interrupted by musical pieces is clearly over. Apparently not. I am frankly shocked how many raving reviews this calculated, heartless and unfunny movie got both from critics and users. Clearly something must be wrong with my taste. The initial premise of separating the sisters is totally stupid, the anticlimax in the middle feels forced and unbelievable, there is no real villain, the romance feels incredibly stale, and the music is annoying as hell (even though so forgettable I couldn't remember any of the tunes 30 min later). This is a huge step back for the genre of animated movies, and the saddest thing is that with these kind of reviews, we're gonna see more of this garbage in the future.",

We're talking two sisters who have been isolated from each other almost their entire life. Drama galore, Right? Anyways, the songs are just magical. \"Let it Go\" is just over the top, and obviously deserved it's well-earned Oscar. Don't even get me started on \"For the First Time in Forever: Reprise\", which really shows the changing mood in the movie, and shows us basically what happens when somebody shuts another person out. Olaf the snowman is really annoying, however, which is why I gave this movie an eight out of ten, and I rather disliked \"In Summer\". Kristoff and Sven are cute. Oh man, I almost forgot Hans.

Plus, the love between Anna and Kristoff doesn't get to be the most important relationship in the movie which is quite an achievement for Disney movies. At the end, the little princess and the ice trader end up being just a normal couple which will not necessarily become a marriage.

The characters are likeable nothing amazing but I enjoyed them. The presentation is nice but nothing spectacular. What stands out in this movie are three amazing songs the best I\u2019ve heard from Disney in years! I will admit it is not as iconic as The Lion King or Aladdin but hey it is hard to make a masterpiece and for what they did they did a pretty good job. It is hard to take the Disney formula and constantly make it feel fresh and new but they managed. The reason why some people may not like it is because they enjoy other variations of the story. Also, these guys aren\u2019t Pixar nor do they have the original team that did the 90s Disney movies. I will admit it is not Disney\u2019s best but it is still an enjoyable film the best of the year in fact and the best animated film of the year thus far (although The Wind Rises will probably win). If you are a Disney fan you\u2019ll enjoy yourself and if you are along for the ride you\u2019ll get through it ok. As for me this the best of the new age of Disney and it is a shame the film is being marketed as a dumb comedy. It may not be their best but has some great stuff in here that impressed we in ways that Tangled didn\u2019t. Frozen didn\u2019t have the greatest animation or funniest side characters but its story engaged and surprised me and had some fantastic songs and atmosphere. While Pixar\u2019s films have declined in quality (from excellent to good/ok) Disney\u2019s films have gotten better. They aren\u2019t the greatest but it is enjoyable to see it done again and well if I might add. Really enjoyed this film and cannot wait for Disney\u2019s next flick Big Hero 6.",

That's what Disney is all about, keeping their promises and start rebuilding a new generation of Renaissance after a past decade of good and bad movies that almost ruined their reputation for success. But 5 years have come gone by since The Princess and the Frog and just like any movie musical has to offer. Disney, I hope you should make more animated musicals in the future.

Whilst playing she accidentally injures her sister with her magic, causing her hair to gain a strip of white. The king and queen take her to the friendly trolls, who erase Anna's memory of Elsa's powers and tell the king and queen to make sure Anna is never struck in the heart in order to prevent her from freezing forever. Upon hearing this the royal parents isolate Elsa in order to help her learn to control and maintain her powers. This seems to be working out until the parents, in traditional Disney fashion, are tragically killed in a storm. Three years pass and Elsa is becoming queen of Arendelle, and Anna meets a man named Hans who appears to be the love of her life. The two wants to get married, but Elsa denies it because they met each other that day. Anna gets upset and yells at her sister about how she always shuts her out and is never there for her, and incidentally causes Elsa to expose her powers. Elsa runs away in shame, and Anna goes to find her. Besides the two princesses, there is a slew of side characters. One being a bland explorer named Kristoff who helps Anna get up the mountain, a comic relief-reindeer named Sven, and an actually funny talking snowman named Olaf. The story of this movie is very good, and it also throws traditional Disney fans a lot of curve balls. There are a lot of things you think will end up happening, when in the end they really don't. The story is essentially the bet part of the movie for me, while everything else is just mediocre. Besides Olaf the happy go lucky snowman and Anna being a bit of an awkward ditz, all the other characters were very bland. Hans turns into a stereotypical villain who just wants the throne, Kristoff is incredibly bland, and the reindeer is only there for comic relief. It does get a laugh here and there, but Olaf provides a lot more. Even Elsa is very boring, being really anti social and irrationally douchey to her sister. The voice acting on  all the characters is great, except for Idina Menzel as Elsa. For me, she felt really disconnected from the animation, talking or singing. The songs in this movie are my biggest gripe. The lyrics are iffy, the transitions from talking to singing are awkward and poorly handled, and the pacing of all of them is very wonky. There are about three songs at the start and two in the middle, leaving the third act completely barren when it comes to songs. Animation is incredible, pairing classic Disney charm with modern animation techniques. Overall this film is great, but it's full of little nitpicks I have that really prevent me from enjoying the full experience. Here are a slew of nitpicks I had.  Why does Anna sing the lines \"Do you wanna build a snowman?\" a scene after their parents die? Their parents just died! Why in the world would you ask if she wants to build a snowman!? The song \"Reindeer Are Better Then People\" is incredibly stupid and all for filler. The way Kristoff talks for Sven is dumb, but I'm trying to decide if that's better then Sven actually talking. The old man character from Wesselton was idiotic and for the most part unnecessary. Overall, Frozen has a good plot, funny moments, and strong themes, along with a feminist twist that will please many. On the other hand, there's awkward writing, some unimpressive characters, and poor song handling. However, it is a Disney movie, so you've probably already seen it regardless of things you've heard.",

      "text": "Frozen is an adaption of the Hans Christian Andersen story, The Snow Queen, however since it's a Disney film you know it's going to stray from it's source material. But that's not a bad thing because Frozen is still an entertaining film for what it is, however I didn't really find this film to be as enjoyable in comparison to some of Disney's other films. But I will still give my verdict on the film. First off, the animation is great as always even though I will still forever miss the charm that traditional animation has. The characters are enjoyable and I like how they are fairly relatable when compared to some Disney characters in the past, despite some characters being good I also think there were some characters that we could have done well without; In fact the main villain of this movie was very disappointing and probably my least favorite Disney villain of all time now. The story is also fairly good but I do think it was a bit shallow at times, and I did notice a few plot holes here and there. Some of the songs in this film are good but there were others that I felt where trying to hard to be like some of the more classic Disney songs but ended up not doing as well of a job. Now despite my criticisms, I do like that this film's moral is a bit different then other Disney films but really it's not enough to make me like the film anymore than I already do. Overall this film is good but I felt that it could have been much better and I really am not looking forward to this film's sequel.  This film has also been called the year's \"best animated film\" but I would actually prefer some other animated films that came out this year over this one like Despicable Me 2, Monster's University and The Wind Rises. Despite my critical feelings towards this film, it will definitely entertain your children and some adults with the Disney charm that it has.",

The content of the film is especially great for children, which is probably why so many people recommend it, but I am 17 years old (and I'm a male) and the story just really took me away from my comfortable spot with cheesiness and childish setting. To be completely honest, the music wasn't all that great either. \"Let it Go\" was the only song in the entire film that caught my entire attention. As for the others, they're not going to be songs that even I'll be sitting in my room alone singing under my breath. It's a really great film to have if you were very young and growing up watching it, but as for the older people, we might as well just stick with our Beauty and the Beast and Little Mermaid.",

As a whole, the movie has a few ignorant mistakes such as constant and overwhelming musical numbers, which are fairly common. It's not that they themselves are bad in terms of quality, however their quantity easily averts attention away from the plot/scene at hand. Another let-down for me is how short the film felt. Don't get me wrong - there's enough to go on, but it still felt as if something could be something more added. People tend to dislike the film because it doesn't meet the standards of a Disney tittle, which is not in any way fair - the entire project should be considered as a whole, that is, Frozen is a wonderful film for people of all ages and will most certainly leave you misty-eyed at the end.

However, for children, this film will bring great joys. Their first faultier was in the character design of Anna, their primary character. Her design was far too familiar and heavily resembled Tangle's Rapunzel. She bore the familiar round eyes, thin innocent smile, and quirky let-it-loose innocence. The trio of Anna, Christoph, and Sven also felt familiar to the trio of Rapunzel, Flynn, and Maximus in Tangled. Their second questionable decision was the extent (and way) in which they added musical scenes. Two or three pieces of music done correctly would have fit perfectly. However, the music was a distraction. The opening piece didn't excel vocally to set the tone as it should have, and Idina Menzel (Elsa) took us outside of the film and onto broadway. She has a beautiful voice, but the execution in which her voice was utilized took away from the quality of the story. Another huge gap would be the connection between the audience and the King and Queen before their passing. It wasn't as heart-wrenching as it should have been because the audience didn't have that moment where we saw a \"smile-worthy\" memory in relationship to them and their children. (Perhaps a scene where the whole family played in the snow?) A final detail of concern is that Disney has not noticeably recognized the culture in which Disney Princesses stories are told, however, I had hoped to feel a little more of the Norwegian Culture. Perhaps by having a norwegian cast, instead of the popular celebrities.",

E\u2019 il primo film della premiata ditta scritto completamente da una donna, circostanza da cui proviene con ogni probabilit\u00e0 l\u2019accento sulla sorellanza (ma  anche l\u2019aria che tira, visto che anche \u2018Ribelle  The Brave\u2019 della rivale Pixar ha una protagonista fenninile), e ritorna a basarsi su una fiaba classica dopo \u2018Rapunzel  L'intreccio della torre\u2019, del quale per\u00f2 non riesce a raggiungere il livello qualitativo. La pellicola uscita nel 2010 mostra infatti una brillantezza e un\u2019inventiva maggiori, oltre ad essere parecchio pi\u00f9 divertente: sicuramente la cupa favola che qui fornisce l\u2019abbastanza libera ispirazione (\u2018La regina dei ghiacci\u2019 di Andersen) non aiuta, ma lo sviluppo della storia patisce la mancanza di coerenza dal punto di vista dello stile narrativo e non sempre le singole situazioni sono davvero convincenti. La prima parte  quasi un musical  con il parlato ridotto rispetto alle molte canzoni, alcune delle quali assai valide (la musica  di Robert Lopez e le parole inglesi sono di Kristen Anderson-Lopez, peccato per il doppiaggio)  poi, da quando Elsa si ritira nel suo castello sul picco pi\u00f9 alto intonando la coinvolgente \u2018Let it go\u2019 (in italiano \u2018All\u2019alba sorger\u00f2\u2019, vabb\u00e8\u2026) e congelando tutto, lo svolgimento si concentra quasi in esclusiva sull\u2019azione. Anna va alla ricerca della sorella supportata dal commerciante di ghiaccio Cristoph e dalla sua renna, vivendo un\u2019avventura nella neve con qualche momento insipido (il mostro a difesa del castello) e un bel finale che supera la trita convenzione del \u2018bacio d\u2019amore\u2019: soprattutto, per\u00f2, i due incontrano il pupazzo di neve Olaf che ravviva l\u2019atmosfera essendo protagonista di un discreto numero di gag riuscite, a partire dal suo amore per il caldo che, ovviamente, non conosce. La voce di Enrico Brignano si rivela una scelta azzeccata (quella originale  di Josh Gad) per un personaggio che contribuisce non poco a recuperare l\u2019interesse che  almeno per lo spettatore adulto  stava un po\u2019 andando a scemare. Detto che Elsa all\u2019inizio del progetto doveva essere una cattiva a tutto tondo e che la sua posizione  stata modificata in corso d\u2019opera, va infine sottolineato che tra i pregi del film stanno sicuramente il disegno e l\u2019animazione: l\u2019accurata documentazione sull\u2019architettura norvegese per la citt\u00e0 di Arendelle e lo studio attento dei fiocchi di neve servono da base alla creativit\u00e0 degli artisti dello studio Disney che raggiungono il loro massimo nella costruzione, libera e di notevole potenza immaginativa, del castello della regina delle nevi. Infine, va anche sottolineato come, sebbene i pi\u00f9 piccoli possano spaventarsi un po\u2019 in qualche passaggio, il film sia soprattutto un intrattenimento destinato ai bambini che si va a inserire nel grande filone che comprende, ad esempio, titoli come \u2018La bella e la bestia\u2019: per una volta gli adulti, blanditi in questi anni con ogni sorta di ammiccamenti e citazioni, ritornano al loro ruolo di semplici accompagnatori.",

      "text": "Frozen takes me back to the days of the Disney Renaissance with it's music, imagery, and the magic of fantasy and fairy tales. The two stars, Anna and Elsa, are wonderfully played by Kristen Bell and Idina Menzel, respectively. Love is provided a different meaning this time around compared to previous Disney films and its not just about love between a princess and prince or anything related to that. Of course, there is a eventual relationship between one of the main girls and one of the main guys. However, that is besides the point. The film shows that there is more to true love than we usually think of, which is pretty nice. There is a lot of examples of girls feeling empowered, besides the obvious one when Elsa sang \"Let It Go\" after running away from Arendelle after exposing her ice powers to the public. There's a lot of likable characters in this movie, including Olaf who provides most of the humor along with the clumsy Anna. The music is wonderful and it re-creates that Disney magic that I have not seen in a while, in terms of Disney animated musicals. The atmosphere and imagery of the film is incredible and makes the area of Arendelle vast. The animation is pretty cool, especially the snow effects, which proves central to the film's story and characters. Overall, very good movie and for those who have questioned whether Disney Animation Studios has lost its magic, here's your answer (along with Tangled).",

Why use the same plot twist more than once. Does Disney Animation Studios think i'm an idiot. The ending didn't seem to go anywhere. It seemed that all people hated the queen because she had powers. By the end for some odd reason, they all loved her. Nothing occurred to give them a reason to love her. The creators of this film oddly decided to combine Shrek and Tangled. They took the plot of Magical spells, and \"true loves kiss\" from Shrek. Just about everything else from Tangled, musical edition. Anthropomorphism of horses and reindeer, and love found in unusual places. This film is the epitome of unoriginal. It had the potential to be good. If it wasn't so good at being a copy cat.",

Maybe it's because everyone hyped it up but honestly, there were too many plot holes and the characters really didn't change or develop. I was willing to let all that slide but when I heard someone said they thought Elsa was a strong princess that showed up all other Disney princesses, I lost it. I generally pretty forgiving when I'm giving a criticism of something (since I definitely couldn't have done a better job) but all I ask for is a somewhat believable plot and mediocre characters and I didn't find that. Elsa may be young but she was old enough to be a queen. She should have been smart enough to train and control her abilities or at least consider what she might do if she were discovered, seeing as how she couldn't even touch something for 3 seconds without revealing herself. She should have been mature enough not to run away from her responsibilities. Other Disney princesses may have had run away for love stories or adventure but I can understand that. They lived in an oppressive, patriarchal society filled with arranged marriages. Many of them even had admirable qualities like compassion, strong morals, humbleness, an fearless will, etc . They found and fought for their happy ending and, when they became queens, were loved by their people because they didn't hold any of their past fears or desires with them. Elsa was a queen from the start, not a young girl and not a princess. Her people are who she (should) be living for. She also had a younger sister to think of. Anna couldn't have possible taken over the throne with her inexperience and eagerness to please.  As well, another thing that didn't seem real was the sudden shift in Hans character and the (almost forced) love between Anna and Kristoff. As if it were just a way to throw the audience with no reason other than to extenuate how they are trying to change their princesses. If that was the point, there are better ways to tell that kind of story (ex: harry potter or Mulan, where romantic love stories were a secondary focus). However, I have to admit the songs were great. That was certainly one redeemable quality. In the end, if the question was would I was it again, the answer is no. On the other hand, if you want to know if you should watch it for a first time, then yes it is worth it. My review may not be a positive one, but the movie really was not terrible, just frustrating.",

I believe the psychological aspect of a movie being perceived as \"overrated\" can result in people believing the movie to then be worse than it actually is. Also, I think many people have the desire to be countercultural for the sake of being independent and unique. Regardless, I believe this movie to be very strong, one of the best to come out of Disney for a long time. Frozen does an excellent job of using the musical format to advance its character development. The songs are not there simply to add some music and draw the attention of children. They are there to develop the characters and drive the plot. I thought Elsa was one of Disney's more complex characters. There has never been a Disney princess with quite the amount of psychological struggle that Elsa goes through. Plus, the King and Queen who (unsurprisingly) perish actually play a big role, by creating the fear in Elsa at a young age. Kristen Bell does an exceptional job as Anna, who takes a different path from other Disney princesses in that she actually has to explore the concept of love and reevaluate her perspective. The twist with Hans was phenomenal in that I would never expect Disney to pull a move like that. I truly believe Hans to be on a similar level to Scar in his strategic planning and sociopathic manipulation of others. Contrary to what others may believe, I thought Hans was a great Disney villain. In general, the movie does a wonderful job of taking cliches and using them to its advantage to create new paths for its story and characters. Excellent film, and even as a lifelong Disney fan, I consider this to be one of my favorites.",

It really falls flat, especially in the third act where the movie is at its ultimate worst. The voice acting is okay, especially since the characters are already so unoriginal.",
