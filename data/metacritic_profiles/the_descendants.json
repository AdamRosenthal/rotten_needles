However, in About Schmidt, I bought Jack Nicholson as an everyday guy from Nebraska who was seriously depressed about his life.  I didn't buy Clooney as a father, or as a a husband struggling to understand what went wrong in his marriage. His performance felt forced, in the way he walked, talked, and other mannerisms, clearly placed by the director, but not believable coming from Clooney.  It actually was distracting from the plot.  I agree with other reviewers about not caring about the characters (with the exception of the daughters).  And this is what separates Nicholson's character in About Schmidt from Clooney's.  Despite Schmidt being completely oblivious, ignorant, and probably a poor father and husband, by the end of the movie you genuinely care for him.  I felt none of that in this movie.",

      "text": "By no means should North Shore be confused for an accurate depiction of life in Hawaii. The 1987 film about an Arizonian surfing champ who nearly wins the Pipeline Masters, however, is honest enough to depict the racial strife that sometimes exist between the mainlanders and the locals. Rick Kane, oblivious to the tricky dynamics that govern the Hawaiian waters, rebuffs the advice of two seasoned surfers(who in a colonial context, are outsiders) to vamoose, when the \"hui\" suggests that he may be infringing on their turf. \"He's so haole, he doesn't even know he is haole,\" one wave rider complains. To put it more succinctly, Rick is \"haole as s***\", to borrow a phrase from Matt King in The Descendants. Chandler, a longtime board-shaper and resident, who despite being white like his protege, knows the island's stormy history, and explains to the political naif that his victimization(a local boy steals his stuff) pales next to what the Hawaiians lost during the transference of land ownership, the meat and potatoes of colonization. North Shore, warts and all, is redeemed by having a conscience that nearly matches the white guilt of The Descendants, in which Matt's diatribe about skin color, also extends to language, admitting how his clan \"can't even speak pidgin, let alone Hawaiian.\" Just before this searing self-critique, the filmmaker shows the land baron alone in a special room that contains old photographs of his ancestors, the people who made this generational inheritance possible, set to soft indigenous music that, depending on who you are, adds to the scene, either a sense of harmony or dissonance, in regard to the tradition of land stewardship. When Matt ends his backyard speech to the kinfolk with the assertion that they have \"Hawaiian blood\", that they are, in so many words, indeed local, The Descendants may still be deemed by some as being a film about the problems of privileged white people, a la Sofia Coppola's Somewhere. Despite the filmmaker's good intentions, is the King family Hawaiian enough to escape such easy ghettoization, the same upscale zip code where The Royal Tennenbaums reside. As the family takes one final look at their property, acres upon acres of verdant green that reaches, in both directions, the rolling mountains and crystal blue seawater, some will bristle a little when Scottie laments that she missed out on the King family tradition of camping with their comatose mother, like elder sister Alex before her, as if it was a tragedy on par with genocide. Although Matt takes great pains toward not instilling a sense of entitlement in his daughters, when he says that \"in Hawaii, some of the most powerful people look like bums and stuntmen,\" don't forget that he's including himself, not just his cousins in the boardroom, or Hugh, the unassuming barfly at that locals only hangout. In spite of himself, good man and all, there's still a whole lot of pride, and perhaps, a little hubris in Matt, as he surveys his kingdom from a cliff where King Kamehameha may have once stood.  But to the lawyer's credit, he's upfront about his soft-hearted tyranny, admitting in all honesty that \"we didn't do anything to own this land,\" and yet, it's not as if he would give the soil back to the rightful descendants, the homeless Hawaiians, whose forefathers were overrun by foreign interlopers who used religion as a weapon, soon after washing up on island shores. In George Roy Hill's Hawaii, a flawed, but relatively accurate portrayal of how an indigenous group of people lost the war against progress, it's one of the Hawaiian gods, surprisingly enough, not Jesus Christ, who makes his presence known, following the death of the \"alii'nui\", by creating a windstorm that all but blows away the Christian church ministered by the unctuous Rev. Hale. More importantly, as it relates to The Descendants, the 1966 film explains how a man like Matt could inherit such obscene wealth, in a scene where a preacher is expulsed from the ministry for marrying a native woman. \"My wife has bought me several thousand acres of prime land,\" he brags. Still, Hawaii is, by no means, historically accurate. The Hawaiians, inexplicably, don't surf. Just like Matt, who hasn't picked up a board in fifteen years, according to the island chain's unlikely spokesman. Unlike the aforementioned films, Soul Surfer, the inspirational true story about Bethany Hamilton, all but whitewashes the precedence of a self-governing island nation by filling the screen with nary a brown face. Not so coincidentally, the film is faith-based. And yet, one of the gods from Hawaiian folklore accidentally makes a subtextual cameo, in which chanting can be heard over the soundtrack during the shark attack, suggestive of Mano, avenging, perhaps, the wholesale death of his people. Whereas Bethany lost an arm, and the King family loses a wife and mother, the Hawaiians, in the end, lost everything.",

He still has a long way to go to reach the class of actor-turned-director Clint Eastwood, who has enough true inner maturity and confidence to let fellow actors AND actresses shine through. Clooney the over-aged Little Prince doesn't understand fatherly responsibility, nor what being a truly loving husband means. He confuses self-pity with signs of empathy. Being a pushed-around and self-indulgent even as one's life partner is about to die is just..a bore. The lead character is just a prolong case of poor me why is this happening to me - about having to face his much-neglected family females, being \"bullied\" by his daughter and her seemingly vacant bf (yet seeking his opinion on managing his daughter from the teen idiot). Failure to assert entry-level parental authority at foul-mouthed teen children at a time when the family unit need it the most, is not adorable, nor does it score sympathy points. Scr3wing harmless relatives business agreement last minute self-righteously because one suddenly needs to feel some moral superiority about some grant notion is just super lame and NON-heroic. There are other ways to show that one's suddenly a true noble, like saying nice sweet gentle romantic spiritual things to wife in coma for a change, instead of meddling in other people's family affair and attracting a angry jilted wife into the ward and create drama before the near-dead wife. If he's a real man he should not allow the busybody daughter to drag him into a face-off with the non-consequential ex-lover of his neglected wife. The fact that Clooney's character was forced to grow from a psychological age of 15 to 18 because his wife has \"abandoned\" poor little self-involved him and leaving him with two difficult daughters and a huge fortune, or that he acts sort-of selfless trying to get wife's ex-fling to see her at her dead bed, doesn't make him a very interesting nor likeable person, nor does it make it a worthy story. He is a petty little prince who spent more screen time spitting venom at his departing wife and her harmless best friend, than being nice to the wife, a caricature of a role who could not talk back at him or defend herself. From start to end, it is about how HE feels, and not about HER. This is a man who is deeply interested in himself, which was supposedly the story problem, even as he pretends to care about something greater than himself as the story progresses. At the end, it remained all about him, how tough it is to do basic father/hubby thing, and his petty little ego injury. Clooney's shallow performance of self-pity as \"feelings\" demanded so much screen time, even the potentially interesting Electra archetype daughter character failed to emote beyond 1-D sullen self-involved teen princess to a real 3D human female. Still, her good looks plus at least five bikini changes, and lush beautiful Hawaii island scenes somewhat redeemed the boring subject of Clooney non-character and non-emotional journey.",

I would say its script is among the worst of its features, and there is no shortage of bad features \"The Descendents\" boasts. From the cringeworthy dialogues, to the placid performances of underwritten characters, to the cliched ending, it's a snoozefest of terrible. The voiceover is tacky and disappears mysteriously halfway through, having served its expository goal. There are F words aplenty, none of which coming naturally from its utterers - be it preteens or the always charming but never offensive Clooney. The exchanges are forced and bland. The development of character, if any, feels forced as well - one minute somebody does something portraying him in one light, the next - its opposite, there is no gradualness or shades.",

In fact, I thought it was Clooney who showed greater range in his two films than Pitt. None of the four are great movies but the \"Descendants\" was enjoyable. The subject matter did not really grab me but that's ok. I was expecting more but it is a better than average film although you know what decision he will make about the land.

      "text": "Alexander Payne is an expert at exploring rather dark subject matter in a relatively light-hearted way. We saw him do this in his last feature Sideways, and he carries on the tradition in The Descendants. The film discusses life, death, love and relationships, all pretty hefty subjects, through a combination of honest drama and comedy. The cast are superb across the board, with George Clooney, Shailene Woodley, Judy Greer, Beau Bridges, Nick Krause and Robert Forster all giving sterling performances. Despite the universal acclaim Clooney's performance as Matt King has received (though quite rightly so), the real star of the film is the brilliant newcomer Amara Miller, playing Matt's wild younger daughter Scottie. The film is well-written, beautifully filmed, very funny and has a fine summer collection of Hawaiian shirts on show. It's the contrast between humour and serious drama that makes the film work in the end - there's some great physical comedy from Clooney, and some funny moments in the dialogue throughout, but also many rather tender, emotional and dramatic scenes (my favourite scene from the entire film is right at the end, with Matt and his two daughters snuggled up on the couch under a blanket and eating ice cream). The Descendants is really the story of a fairly privileged man who's trying to get through a really bad year in his life, and needs to himself (and his family) back on track. It's also a road movie - though Matt King's individual experiences are important moments for him and the audience, it is his difficult journey back to a relative normality in his life that really rewards the viewer. It's a refreshingly honest family drama, and despite having a pretty dark heart, the overall viewing experience is a cheerful and fulfilling one. We meet and spend time with believable people, characters who we can truly empathise with, and that is what makes the Descendants truly stand out from the crowd.",

      "text": "Into Personal Hell Alexander Payne makes films like novels. Unlike most films made from novels, none of the clever writing or sub-text is missing - it's all there on the screen. His work is character-driven, with seemingly loose plots, and are aimed at adults. In a world of cartoonish, special effects driven films, it's a great relief that he is here. This is darker than Sideways, and in some respects, just as good. Hawaii may look like paradise, but for Payne, it's paradise schmaradise. Gorgeous George plays against type. He is a schlumpy lawyer from a deeply rich local family. His almost dead wife has had an affair behind his floral shirted back. Forced to get a grip on his kids and his life, Matt King (Clooney) succeeds in confronting all the **** he has been long avoiding, including his wife's lover and his own family. In the climax to the sub-plot that's the most obvious part of the film, he tells his extended family he won't permit the last piece of family virgin land to be exploited, so that they can all be rich. He tells them if they don't like it, they can sue him. He says goodbye to his wayward, dying wife in a scene that is moving and true to life. The human comedy is Payne's game, and it is unusual for a US movie with mainstream stars to feature death so prominently. But it works. The surface has rays of light through the Hawaiian clouds, but don't kid yourself. This is as deep and unforgiving as American films get. If you want jet black death, watch Bergman's Cries and Whispers. If you want Americano death, you get a shot of cream and whiff of sugar. Yeh, give George his Oscar already - he won't get one for Oceans 14, and he's not going to the Middle East again. And give Payne one for his screenplay.",

      "text": "Alexander Payne hasn't directed a feature-length film since 2004's Sideways, but if you're concerned that his seven-year absence might have dulled his storytelling skills, you can go ahead and put those fears to rest. The Descendants is the best film Payne has created yet, and features two career-defining performances, one from arguably the biggest movie star in Hollywood, and the other from an up-and-coming young actress that you'll be hearing plenty of great things about. George Clooney stars as Matt King, a Hawaiian native whose family is heir to a massive stretch of undeveloped beachfront property on the island of Kauai. As sole trustee, Matt must ultimately decide whether to sell that land to investors and make himself and his greedy, overbearing relatives rich beyond their wildest dreams. In the midst of this conflict arises another issue of a much more personal nature: Matt's wife, Elizabeth, is lying comatose after a boating accident, and she's not expected to wake up. Not only must Matt find a way to cope with this tragedy, he must also find a way to reconnect with his two daughters, the bratty but well-meaning Scottie (Amara Miller) and the angry, troubled Alexandra (Shailene Woodley). When Matt finally breaks the news to Alex that her mother's living will requests that she be removed from life support, she drops another bombshell: it seems that Elizabeth was having an affair. Clooney expertly navigates the myriad of troubles that Matt is presented with, doing some of the most complex work of his career as he inhabits this disheveled, defeated man who tries so hard to do the right thing for everyone without having the slightest clue what the \"right thing\" is. Clooney's performance is buoyed by a terrific supporting cast, including Beau Bridges as a greedy cousin pressuring Matt to sell the land, and Robert Forster as Matt's surly, tough-as-nails father-in-law. While we spend most of our time focused on Matt, it often feels like the centerpiece of the film is Alex, magnificently portrayed by Shailene Woodley (in her film debut) as the perfect embodiment of adolescent rage. The moment when she spitefully reveals her mother's secret feels so authentic that the audience feels like they're intruding on a real-life conversation between a parent and their angsty teen, but despite the character's bratty nature, the bond she begins to develop with her estranged father as they embark on a darkly comedic quest for answers becomes the driving force of the film. There's not a single character in The Descendants that doesn't have some sort of flaw, and the film makes no effort to paint them as anything but dysfunctional. We invest ourselves in the lives of these characters because there's something about each of them that we can recognize and relate to. Nobody in this film is perfect, and that's precisely what makes this a perfect film. --www.nerdrep.com",

The story, as I read in another review, was predictable. The plot points were not at all complex, and somewhat boring. I'm not going to say it was a horrible movie, but it sure wasn't the most fascinating movie I've seen by any stretch of the imagination. Sad to say, it seems like Payne's days of creating high art, such as the movie Sideways, are over. I think it's also important to note that the acting was very mechanical, and not natural. For me personally, it was not an addictive movie, unlike his 2004 film. The Hawaiian setting could have allowed for either an extremely interesting, or really bad movie. It seemed like Payne was trying really hard to keep it from veering off into really bad. The other thing that makes me argue against it being a great movie is that I didn't learn anything from it. I think the only thing I learned is that the children of bad parents, say bad words and do stupid things. The Descendants was a smug, and pretentious film that did not have much artistic merit. Trust your instincts and say no to this movie. Not worth it. Watch a Coen brothers film.",

The acting is also very strong from George Clooney and the young actress Shailene Woodley, the scenes the two shared where some of the films best.
