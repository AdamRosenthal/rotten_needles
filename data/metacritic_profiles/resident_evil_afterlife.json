It's immune to the conventions of other films, because it's only purpose is to entertain, and in that purpose, it succeeds. The 3-D is the best I've seen (I never saw Avatar in 3D), and definitely helps set the mood and the tone of the film. My only real complaint is Anderson's overuse of slow-mo. Every single fight scene has it, and while it's cool, it just becomes distracting and somewhat dull somewhere around the 4th or 5th time you see it.

Filmmaker Richard Linklater must have sensed that music was Jovovich's true calling when he cast her as a folksinger in \"Dazed and Confused\", where the composer of the Kate Bush-inspired \"Gentleman Who Fell\"(the former Vogue cover girl captures Bush's flair for the theatrical with a playful deftness) can be glimpsed strumming a blue guitar in the company of stoners.

As an actress, she also played everybody's favorite fifteenth-century heretic in Luc Besson's \"The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc\", in which her performance as The Maid of Orleans fell somewhere between Ingrid Bergman and Jane Wiedlin. To put it tactfully, Jovovich could have used more seasoning, but she wasn't awful on the scale of Sofia Coppola in Francis Ford Coppola's \"The Godfather III\"; she deserved a second chance at a project that called for more than a pretty face and tight physique. But Hollywood can be unforgiving to actresses who bomb in their first starring role(witness Brittany Murphy's descent after Nick Hurran's \"Little Black Book\"), so once again, she's \"Alice in Video Gameland\", playing a woman with a pretty face and tight physique in \"Resident Evil: Afterlife\", her fourth(fifth, if you count Kurt Wimmer's \"Ultraviolet\") go-around as deadly eye-candy, with the added plus of being deadly eye-candy in 3D. (Admittedly, the film works on the level of spectacle: the 3D is first-rate.) Jovovich, however, is too smart for her prevailing demographic group. (The music video for \"Gentleman Who Fell\" references avant-garde filmmaker Maya Deren's \"Meshes in the Afternoon\", for Pete's sake.) Unfortunately, whereas Apple was romantically involved with Paul Thomas Anderson, the once-promising singer-songwriter ended up with the other Paul Anderson. Jovovich's pairing with her filmmaker/husband on the \"Resident Evil\" series recalls Geena Davis' work with ex-hubby Renny Harlin(\"Cutthroat Island\", \"The Long Kiss Goodnight\") in that the action-oriented films ruined Davis' cachet as an adept dramatic actress. \"To Kill a Dogwalker\", indeed. With a break or two, maybe Jovovich could've had Famke Janssen's career. As she proved in David Twohy's \"A Perfect Getaway\"(a vastly underrated movie about duplicitous honeymooners on holiday in Hawaii), the beautiful Versace girl does indeed have an acting range than extends beyond steely resolve, in which she more than held her own with Steve Zahn, showing at long last, the opportunity to do more than shoot guns in skin-tight outfits.",

Yes, it is filled with pseudoscientific nonsense, cookie-cutter characters and over the top action scenes. But there are many visually stunning moments, plot is relatively coherent, if compared to other action films, and there are more heart-warming video game references than you can count. Visual style of this movie borrows heavily from Matrix, Aeon Flux, GitS and not exactly in worst way possible. At least Mila Jovovich is much more believable as superhuman action girl than her counterpart in Aeon Flux. I believe, this move perfectly does what is supposed to do - represent classic video game franchise on silver screen in most spectacular way without adding overly complex plot or giving needless exposure to new characters nobody cares about. It is impressive enough to forget about small details such as boat appearing from nowhere, zombies, who apparently don't move while camera doesn't show them, or Wesker being almost exact clone of Agent Smith. I like how support characters die in this movie and nobody cares, everyone being more concerned about his own survival. I'd just like to see more fear on faces of those poor actors who forced to imagine hordes of zombies while staring at camera in empty room. And no more bullet time, thanks.",

Kill them off of course! However... I have to confess that like the previous films, this series is a guilty pleasure for me. Unlike the entirely too slick, too pretensious summer blockbuster fare we usually get (e.g, especially the _Transformers_ type), the _Resident Evil_ films seem to revel in their kitschiness and for me that gives them more heart.. These films are low grade B fare, they know it and have fun with their lowliness! Moreover, the heart and soul of these films is Alice; though I would never make the case for Milla Jovovich being a brilliant actress, she brings a remarkable soulfulness to the role that holds these films together. My fear -- my sense -- is that this film is transitioning her out of the series (the Redfield siblings seem to get too many key moments) and to my mind, without Alice, this series is dead.",

Although there aren't that many. He needs work on casting and writing. I believe he is almost as good as Ronald Emmerich.   Plot:(5) Failed source material that at least invloves the game's villian and main hero this time. The enemies are still not as varried as the games. The sub villian was an axe wheliding zombie which was just a basic enemy in the game. The movie had no tyrants or giant mutated sea creatures. Lets hope El Giante makes it in the next installment.    I did not understand why no one trusted Chris. He was locked up in a cage and they actually had someone guard him while they are faced with a great global treat. If he really wanted to kill someone he could have lewered the dumb guard next to the cell and snapped his neck and stolen the keys. He was in the cell chilling out like being a prision was chill and no big deal.    I dispised the cliches like memory loss and the dumb survivors. They always seem to  die one scene at a time like in a slasher movie.  It was well paced in terms of direction, but the preditiblity put a lot of hurt on the suspense. Varaity:(6) Action takes over almost every scene. When the story kicks in, it just becomes a chore to watch. Not one brilliant piece of dilalog. I felt that the fight scenes disapointed. The enemies died far too quickly and didn't put up much of a fight at all. It didn't feel like much of adventure since the characters were stranded on  a large building in the middle of the dead city. It was fun to look at and the intro was practically flawless. Acting: (5) Milla is a great looking actor that suits the Fem fatal that she portray. She is dressed far better and is more convincing as a manga super hero come to life. The guy who played Wesker was also well cast. He was dark and reminded me very much of the game character. The rest of the characters such as Clare and Chris bareley made an impression. Poorley casted, poorley dressed and have no real purpose in the film other than to support backup for Alice.    The skeptical producer who stared in the film was flat out annoying. The actor who played Lucthor had a much larger role than Chris. He had nothing to do with the games, yet he was practically a main supporting actor. He wasn't horrible, yet he reminded me of a wanna be Will Smith. Audio: (9) Unique musical score that builds on 80's horror and cybor-punk techno. Fight scenes felt hard hitting and monsters sounded frighting. Would have been nice to hear a few more remixes in the orchestrated library.",

      "text": "Here we go again, another Resident Evil movie, just great. Well, while most might be pretty skeptic about this newest Paul W.S. Anderson directed installment of the popular video game to movie franchise gone bad, fear not. Although these movies started bad from the beginning, Afterlife proves to basically be the same formula, but polished and a step up from the last three crap-fests. The 3D was charming and proved to be a delight. All of this stupid Matrix, slo-mo bullet-time **** has just got to stop though. It's bad enough that Wesker looks so much like Neo anyways!! I'm just trying to figure out which one of the games allowed you to bust into slow-motion bullet time to dodge bullets, giant axes and mutated doberman pinscher's! Anyhoo, despite all of the overblown action, the movie actually held together pretty well. It was actually more reminiscent of the old zombie films like 'Dawn of the Dead' and 'Night of the Living Dead'. Warning though, if you have not seen the other Resident Evil movies, especially Extinction, you might be kind of confused with the relations of some of the characters. I enjoyed the idea of reducing Alice (Milla Jovovich's) powers back down to a mortal, ass kicking human being instead of this mutated, T-cell prodigy. This reduction still doesn't restrain her from triple back flipping off of walls and all that, but none the less, it was much better than Extinction and the other two. I thought the movie could have been a little bit darker, more serious and more horror movie like. I never understood why Paul W.S. Anderson decided to try to take this radical approach toward a video game that was basically a homage to the old zombie films. If he would just leave out half of the action nonsense and factor in more scares and horror, It might actually live up to the title of Resident Evil. *Overall, Resident Evil: Afterlife was a fun, popcorn movie with pretty thin characters, desolent locales and hordes and hordes of 3-D zombie gore. The huge, hooded guy with the gigantic axe was a pretty cool enemy. I liked Wesker's character, he was a good evil villain, but i would have just changed the way he looked for the movie in fear of a lawsuit from the Wachowski's! And yes the 3-D was actually very enjoyable and definitely added 1 extra star to this review as well as some extra visual charisma to the movie.",

(the way he talked and expressed), and many more. Terrible rip-off! Thiz game adaptation is a sequel from three early movies: RESIDENT EVIL (2002), RESIDENT EVIL: APOCALYPSE (2004), and RESIDENT EVIL: EXTINCTION (2007). Paul W. S. Anderson takes back his command as Director since the first franchise. In my observation, Anderson is another -Michael Bay- type of mindless popcorn Director, who always delivers mind-blowing action with extra excessive situation and seems fully unrealistic, like what he showed on MORTAL KOMBAT (1995), AVP: ALIEN VS. PREDATOR (2004) and DEATH RACE (2008).The brainless main plot follows Alice (Milla Jovovich) continue to fight against Umbrella Corporation, which is turning the world into zombieland. Like the tag line on the poster says, She is back and she is bringing a few of her friends, thiz movie is appearing all the original characters of game version, such as: Claire Redfield (Ali Larter), Chris Redfield (Wentworth Miller), and Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory) although only appears as cameo in ending. There is no character development in thiz movie, everything is flat. It is 97 minutes movie with a bunch of slow-motion sequences. One thing is for sure, in the movie like thiz you do not even have to worry during the film, the main character wont die in any circumstances. Prepare yourself for another carousel ride!",

How Alice survived a plane crash when she has no powers and is just a regular human? You won't find them in the movie. If you think the movie should follow the games, you are out of luck too. The inclusion of the chest spiders, the type 2 plagas, the executioner and even Chris Redfield himself was just a nod to RE5 and are obviously force-written into the script. There is ZERO explanation as to how the Plagas and Executioner came into existence, or why they're even there besides a brief slow-mo fight scene. Chris's reunion with Claire had the potential sucked out of it when Claire was under the amnesia-influence of the drugs from the chest spider (that's not even what it does in the game, but whatever) and didn't even recognize him. Not that it mattered because that was the only mention of them being siblings in the entire movie anyway. Then there's the Redfield showdown with Wesker - which was never mentioned before, and all of a sudden we're supposed to know that this is an epic fight. Weak writing, weaker story, force-feeding the audience elements from the game that were not explained to fit the movie's storyline.

Milla Jovovich appears to still be having fun in her role as series protagonist Alice, and mercifully, writer/director Paul W S Anderson eventually saw sense and chose to remove her ridiculous super powers, and instead give her a seriously cool tool of destruction to wield (who'd have thought spare change could be so deadly?). Wentworth Miller and Boris Kodjoe are both perfectly competent in their roles, and Shawn Roberts makes a much better big baddie Albert Wesker than Jason O'Mara did in Extinction. Despite the improvements from parts 2 and 3, Afterlife still has its fair share of problems. The plot is still ridiculous, the film world full of inconsistencies and the script more wooden and laborious than hauling a wardrobe through an antique furniture shop. An over-indulgence of the 3-D gimmick is also extremely annoying - I don't think Wesker's trademark sunglasses spinning towards your waiting eye sockets would have looked that impressive on the big screen, never mind on DVD! So it's still a thoroughly uneven affair, but at least the fourth Resident Evil film doesn't seem to be taking itself too seriously. And that's lucky, because if it was, then it'd be mocked to within an inch of its afterlife (see what I did there?).",

I mean, a guy with a gigantic ax-hammer and a sack over his head? seriously? Shouldn't he be in Silent Hill or something?",

It doesn't hurt that the film looks and sounds fantastic on Blu-ray as well. The one consistent flaw from the past three films, that still plagues Afterlife, is the up and down writing. Paul Anderson needs to realise that the audience doesn't need to have everything laid out, plain, in front them. The plot can turn, get a bit confusing, and have tragedy. But instead, the film constantly uses painfully simple dialogue and plot points to get through. But the action is amazing, if not too reliant on slow motion. For any fans of less serious movies, or someone who loves a good action flick, this is more than worth checking out.",

Not the entire movie mind you, The first half was poor but the last 50 mins of the film was suprisingly enjoyable. I only have 3 problems with the film. The first is the CGI. In the begining of the film, It was painfully obvious that the Alice \"clones\" were people in CGI suits and that was disapointing. The second being Wesker. Wesker is the main villain of the RE series and in this film he is a joke. He is played off as a poor Agent Smith (the villain from the Matrix) and he spends the entire film getting his butt kicked, Only for a few seconds (while he is beating up Chris and Claire) is he the true badass he really is. The third is the extremely poor use of 3D through out the film. Let's face it, they simply used 3D to make more money and care very little about the actual use of it, Critic reviews show proof of that. Besides all that, It was not that bad of a film and imo the best in the series.",

It will be up to her to find an escape and lead the group to the safe haven known as Arcadia. Paul W.S. Anderson has outdone himself once again in RESIDENT EVIL: AFTERLIFE, creating the most mindless and over-budgeted entry in the series. Anderson's complete lack of concern for story and character is more apparent than ever. From beginning to end, there is no progression or expansion on any of the events from the previous films. It is an unnecessary chapter at best, and a boring one at that. Several new characters are introduced from the video game series, only to be given fewer lines and background than they had in their playable forms. The one place where RESIDENT EVIL continues to excel is in the fast-paced and explosive action sequences, although most are self-indulgent attempts to exploit the 3-D gimmick used in the film's theatrical release. Unfortunately, the open ending lends proof that Anderson's career will continue onward to bigger (but not better) things. -Carl Manes",

Kim Coates for example is an amazingly talented actor, but the way he is written, he is a terrible clich\u00e9. The characters are so unlikeable and bland. The only person I rooted for was the basketball player, because well... I thought he seemed like a nice guy, for the total of 30 second character development he had.
