One of the most laughably bad scripts I've had to sit though in a long time. And people around here poke fun at \"Interstellar?\" This is a reminder how we need to fall down on our knees and praise movies like \"Interstellar\" that at least try to say something smart. At least if the effects in \"San Andreas\" were worth waiting out the doldrums, it might have made sitting through the movie worthwhile, but they weren't even that good. Just average computer bits showering down all over the place.  And you know the pace: SPFX -- talk -- SPFX -- talk --- and talk -- and talk. And what talk. Who writes scripts like \"San Andreas\" -- some rich producer's wife while she's having her nails done, chatting on the phone and watching a Lifetime movie? Once can only sit and scoff at the jello for lines the actors are given to work with. Even the mass of muscle known as The Rock looked weak and helpless about making this dog work. Even worse, it manages to make the smartest actor in Hollywood, Paul Giamatti look like an eyeball rolling puffin -- whose magical computer model predicts the end of the West Coast but doesn't tell him to at least put a call into a disaster agency to share the news.  Word to director: When you're filming the apocalypse, next time try not to shoot the whole thing in medium closeup -- just ready for that leap to TV where it belongs. Poor TV.",

The Rock, action flic, plenty of popcorn CGI...honestly wasn't expecting much,but man was i wrong.....TOTALLY blown away!!! Best special effects EVER!  Best action & suspense EVER! Most surprising was how the director was able to let the  acting, script, and family backstory/lovestory trump the incredible action sequences!!!!  Much like the Deccaprio Winslet backstory in Titanic found a way to trump the ship's demise,  the character development, and outstanding acting found a way to do the same in San Andreas!!! No Titanic, but in my book....this one deserves a WHOLE lot more respect than it's getting!!!  SO SAD that with its poor critical reviews, this work of art will never receive its due rewards & accolades.....can anybody say..\"300\".

Who can breathe when tragedies seem non-stop? Though it becomes overkill and indulgent, the movie is undeniably exciting, bracing and intense. Broken roads and bridge (oh Golden Gate!), collapsing skyscrapers and structures (oh Hoover Dam!), mile-high waves, ship crashing into buildings and almost all elements of an exhilarating disaster film are present in San Andreas. Combined with realistic and awe-inspiring CGI effects, the movie is visually amusing.",

      "text": "San Andreas is a good disaster movie to watch, starring Dwayne Johnson, Alexandria Daddario, and Carla Gugino. The film is about the San Andreas fault line in California going off, triggering a 9.1 in Los Angeles, and a 9.6 in San Francisco. We also get a neat scene in which a 7.1 destroys the Hoover Dam in Nevada. The drama behind the film is Dwayne is estranged to Gugino, but is reunited with her when Daddario is trapped in San Francisco. The two make it from Los Angeles to San Francisco, by helicopter, by stealing a car in Bakersfield, to flying an airplane than a stranger near King City, California offered them for the stolen truck. I won't spoil the rest of the movie, but I will say that it is set in San Francisco for the remainder of the film. The special effects are top notch, possibly the best of any other disaster movie. From the tsunami wave going over the Golden Gate Bridge to the collapse of Los Angeles' AON Center, this film won't disappoint in that factor. However, the cheesy parts with Paul Giamatti brought the movie down to a 9/10. \"Who should we call?\" asks a CalTech student. \"Everybody\" whispers Giamatti. Hahaha. Great movie though!",
