Nobody except Ricky Gervias can play their part, and Jennifer Gardner couldn't have been worse. They have thrown the most boring ideas into one movie, and have created an ultimate disaster. It's hard for me to like a movie, but this was real easy to dislike because it makes me feel uneasy, and by the end I'm thinking: Who cares?!!",

As a result no area is really explored fully enough and the laughs gradually dry up as it reaches its conclusion.",

It would have been a perfect movie for me if the comedy had worked for me as well as I thought it would. But everything else was phenomenal, well, minus the romantic subplot, that is, but, you know, a minor glitch in an otherwise well made movie. I liked how people's attitudes towards sex and marriage are all too focussed on the \"genetics\" of a person, just goes to show some things aren't going to change even in fantasy. Well, all in all, a great movie, minor flaws here and there, but nothing is perfect, so watch it and have fun",
