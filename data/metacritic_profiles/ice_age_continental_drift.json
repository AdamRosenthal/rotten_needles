This is a series of movies that have locked themselves to be merely good enough within each release, never really trying to push boundaries, and with Continental Drift this is more evident than ever. I knew completely what to expect from the beginning and by the end I got exactly that. Some few laughs with the squirrel and a whole lot of nonsense and that is it. I got to admit that I had  little more faith going into this one given that more characters were going to be introduced, a whole group of pirate animals to be exact. This could have opened this Ice Age into fresher territory with more character development, but the truth is that no pirate really develops. One opportunity for example relies on the fact that the two saber tigers, Diego and the girl, were falling in love, but any tease of what the animals may be feeling is left just like that, a tease. They end up together but is hard to tell in what disposition because there relationship is developed in a matter of roughly 5 minutes. So what does Continental Drift means? It means more of the same. A new entry that once again relies on the like-able trio of Mammoth, tiger, and sloth, and off course the lonely squirrel. At is most, it is entertaining and in some parts undeniably funny, but overall this one is pretty forgettable.",

The story was good, with some singing and off plot diversions which the kids enjoyed every time they appeared in the movie. Even the part where the characters sang were enjoyed. There were some references that could peak your caution for the kids. But few and far between. The animation is very good an believable for the kids.",

In Ice Age's fourth outing, Manny, Diego and Sid find themselves separated from Ellie and Peaches after the continents begin to drift. Unlike Toy Story 3, a paragon of a movie for kids and adults, the story is just a vehicle to sell the 3D effects. The humor is few and far between, the new characters are window dressing and the old characters are good. Just good. Do not go see this movie without a five or six year old.

Peaches was annoying and too soft, and the mole should have never become friends with her again after she said she wasn't his friend.
