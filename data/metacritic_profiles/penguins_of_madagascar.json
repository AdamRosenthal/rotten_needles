The spin-off of the Madagascar characters further continues the ridiculousness of the franchise but unexpectedly, the over-ridiculous screenplay has already been seen elsewhere, and it looks a little bit more silly for the elders. Although lighthearted, the paper thin plot that does not allow much of characters development and utilise the ideas from other animations by changing a small part here and there are unable to make the adorable yet naughty penguins to match the quality of the old times of studio's production, even any recent Disney's production, or to match Puss in Boots (spin-off of Shrek series). However, it is indeed a straightforward entertaining stress-free flick even if it falls short of generating powerful inspiration, love and emotion.",

Surprisingly it never gets dull with the film constant moving from one scene to another with lots of energy and at no point is the original Madgascar crew missed as the penguins have always been the stars and prove they can carry the show on their own. Unfortunately, they are joined by a crew of not that interesting characters who weigh down the film following its first ten minutes. Even with this the film is still fun from the Dreamworks style humor involving an overlord of pop culture references and tons of other jokes that surprising don\u2019t get on ones nerves. The film doesn\u2019t do anything deep with the Penguins and at times the film could\u2019ve used some heart but there is a lot of fun and energy among the core characters that keep the film from falling apart. Penguins fans will enjoy the film as they are finally getting the Madagascar film they wanted. Those who aren\u2019t a fan of Dreamworks\u2019 style of humor will probably want to skip this one. Its nowhere near quality of Dreamworks\u2019 How to Train Your Dragon 2 but it\u2019s a fun hour and a half that even with low quality writing and humor that somehow shouldn\u2019t work still manages to be a step above most Dreamworks films.",
