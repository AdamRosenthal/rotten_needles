      "text": "A powerful, compelling documentary told in Tyson's own words. Excellent cinematography, used mostly to underline the many (and conflicted) aspects of the film's subject. The film focuses on both the personal and professional life of Tyson, conveying the links between the two with compassion and, at times, humour. This is truly an authentic autobiography, as the fillmmaker (a long-time friend of Tyson) let the boxer tell his own story. Is this the only story of Tyson, or an entirely objective telling of his life? It may not be, but it is highly candid and genuine. It is neither a paean to the greatness of the man at his peak nor a salacious \"tell-all\" appealing to the gossip crowd. This documentary is a thoughtful meditation on character, excellence, boxing, and an insecure man who has been betrayed countless times.",
