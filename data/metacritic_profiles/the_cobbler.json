What I disliked was that the plot was a bit loose and did not come together completely - I mean there were so many flaws and the ending, maybe not predictable early in the movie, became more and more obvious and it actually kinda didn't make that much sense (not that most of it did). While it has some funny parts, don't expect much comedy here (not that it is drama either). Movie itself was interesting to watch in the sense that you wanted to know what will happen, even though some parts were a bit disappointing and actually repetitive. Plus I did not get how walking in other people shoes and being them will give you that much really - I mean you still have to do bad things to gain money or women or whatever, but they kinda made it that it is meant for doing good things - I just did not get what things actually.Anyway, if you want something more serious and without over the top acting etc, then this is for you and it is a watchable movie, even though you might forget what happened there after a while.",

All he did was overdose comedies which were below par compared to his earlier movies. I said in 'Blended' review that I'm tired of his movie, but watched it only because of the director. All his films were very impressive and I believed him on this one, more than the Sandler. Otherwise, it would have been undoubtedly a skippable flick.",

After utiising it for fun, things become slightly more serious when he gets involved with a girl trying to save the local neighbourhood, local criminals and helping his mother come to terms with his fathers death. For an Adam Sandler film this is certainly a step up from his usual fare, and for the most part this is a charming Capra-esque comedy, which only falls apart towards the end as it tries to hard to please.",
