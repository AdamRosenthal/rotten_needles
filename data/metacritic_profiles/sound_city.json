      "text": "Today's music industry is widely considered to be a jumbled mess of confusion regarding quality vs. craftsmanship of the music, deciphered and taken in by (most) consumers who haven't the ability to tell the difference. In truth, a non-musician would be hard pressed to pick up on the subtleties of classic analogue production over contemporary digital recreation while being inundated with the gospel of technology convincing them otherwise that; \"it's really the same thing, only easier\". Well, Dave Grohol, lead singer of \"The Foo Fighters\" and director of \"Sound City\" would convince you otherwise. How? For starters, what's the difference between a robot of astute perfection and flawlessness and a flawed human with a burning soul?  Since the inception of \"pro tools\", artists have been allotted a standard of mediocrity, later to be corrected by technology of the next level. This is true, and is not to say that tech in general hasn't made our lives easier. However, in order to the get to the core of Grohl's thesis, we don't necessarily need to ump into a deloreon, phone booth or sled and rewind ourselves to the good ol days of analogue tech and tape reels. Just reach into your vinyl and listen for yourself. Do you hear it? That's the sound of perfection, which is what makes vinyl as pure as it is. You see, before the age of digital correction and over correction, a musician had to stand up to the standards of flawlessness  honing in their craft and developing great respect with their simian connection to their instrument. with regards to the recording. This is what Grohl was hoping to address in his new documentary \"Sound City\", and I am pleased to say that he has pulled it off well.",
