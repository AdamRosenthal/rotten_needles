      "text": "I really want to say this I'm a geek for movies that has to do with sci-fi and horror and action, as well as the genre of fantasy. When a film gets released with these very good qualities, I'm your number one man at the movies ready to see it. So when I saw Legion's preview I was very giddy, but there's a problem. What I don't appreciate is that Hollywood thinks I'm a nerd and a geek so I'm going to watch a mediocre movie no matter what. Just because it has a glossy packaging doesn't mean it's good.  What's better to attract a sixteen year old boy to the movies? Oooo I know let's put a poster with the main character and lets have him have really big guns. Wait I have a better idea let's put angel wings behind him that should do the trick. Then the trailer will have cool explosions and really exciting one-liners. Damn this movie got me hooked I'm watching this. They pay $10.50 ticket, $21.00 if they have a date then another $20.00 for food; watching a bad movie not priceless. Well I'm 23 years old and I have seen my share of movies to uncover studios bulls@#t. Legion is a movie that tries to capture fan boys because of the cool images but the serving is really distasteful. It's another stupid attempt to make a franchise.  Legion's plot is a weird one with several holes in it but I'll get to that later. God has lost faith in mankind; he's basically tired of us. So in the bible he sent a flood like much of us has learned, so he decides to send mindless zombies who are possessed by angels. Yeah I said that I didn't stutter. You heard me say mindless zombies right because they're going to end up as target practice like we didn't know that was going to happen. So back to the plot, Michael who is an angel does not agree with God's descion. So he decides to come to earth and sacrifices his angel status and becomes human. You see I put \"angel status\" the movie never explains why he does that. He goes to diner full of misfits to protect a pregnant woman who bears the child to end the war. I have a number of questions on this, where is the father of the child no explanation and nobody bothers to ask. Why does God wants zombies to end the world, is he a big studio executive who wants to see action or God's a big George Romero fan wanted to use zombies.  I'm sorry but Legion being directed by a former special effects director I wasn't really convinced with the special effects. Now I know why George Romero and Danny Boyle can really make zombie movies there zombies transforms in the most disgusting and scariest ways. In Legion they transform like this. Their head shakes really rapidly like a bobble head and black contact lens and fake shark teeth. It looks pretty ridiculous. The acting, don't get me started on the acting Paul Bettany was the only shine of light in this movie and it's a pretty dark movie. Most of all the dialogue was dull as well. I do give credit where credits do. Gabriel and Michael in angel form looks pretty cool. Their action sequence was somewhat entertaining. There is good writing here as well the speech that Michael gives to Jeep and a very cool quote that Michael says in the end. \"You gave him what he wanted but I gave him what he needed\" That was pretty cool, as well as the grandma scene was pretty good too. That's four good things out of so many wrong things can't recommend this even to the low IQs.",

      "text": "what the  *bleep*? This film was awful! Dreadful! The script? My 7 year-old niece has more innovative lines in her 2nd grade essays! The characters? I could care less for any one of these people, and I use the term \"people\" loosely, since zombies seem to have more depth of character then them.  Let the demons get them! What? Not demons? Those ugly mutated zombies (no, not the main cast; the other ones that were actually suppose to be playing something like weird, ninja-zombies) where being possessed by angels? *facepalm*",
