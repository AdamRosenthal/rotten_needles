I had to suffer through watching the movie (was forced to go) about this kid. Don't understand why a movie was made about him when the time, film, money resources could be used for something better, entertaining and makes sense. While pop music may not fade, the people eventually do until the next kid comes around.  Bieber is so \"famous\" because so many preteen people have this inane fantasy that he actually cares about them. All he cares about is the money, all the \"industry\" cares about is the money and the set that likes him has spending power.  The movie was made to cash in quick. But these things are mostly cyclical, and he'll fade away soon enough. Sadly, people like us get to be inundated with this garbage until the ride is over.  The only major fans he attracts are preteen people, who tend to be a very shallow audience and are easily impressionable to like whoever the pop star is.  The major problem is he will be not simply fade in their shallow minds, he will be replaced with another boy or boy band to annoy those of use with 6th grade and higher educations.  He's just another recyclable commodity like most of this teeny, pop idols. be replaced by another \"farmed\" individual that meets the current needs of the music industry today. People are attracted to these individuals(Can I really call them that though? Especially when they don't write their own music or lyrics...) Save your money and time on an actual movie.",

I was dragged to see the Justin Beiber movie Let's get this straight: If you don't like Justin Beiber, theres a 95% chance you'll hate this film. If you're affected by Beiber fever, you'll lap this up like a cat with milk. As you can tell by the opening paragraph, I am not a fan. I don't have anything against Justin Beiber, its great he's come so far from performing on Youtube, but I am in no way a fan of his music, his voice just feels so autotuned. This film utterly feels pointless, it tells you the Beiber story, which you could read on Wikipedia for less money, but the film has an additional selling point: 3D! So basically, if you're too lazy to read Justin Beibers story, you can shell out money and watch it with the addition of interviews with annoying fans (\"I think about him 99% of my life\" says one fan), Baby Beibers footage and baby photos, highlights (I say that loosely) from his Madison Square Garden gig and Miley Cyrus IN 3D!

He didnt go looking for fame, fame found him through his raw talent.

I find him to be a real charming down to earth humble kid (who happens to now be 18).

      "text": "It all started when I was 7 years old. My parents gave me a CD player and a copy of Justin Bieber - Baby for christmas. I fell in love with it the moment I booted up the CD player. The composition, the arrangement, the talent! It overwhelmed my young mind. I listened it for hours on end, memorizing each sentence, each modulation, each note of the melody, every single drum beat. It was the only thing I did, I stopped going outside and playing with my friends, for Justin Bieber was the only friend I needed. Eventually I became unsatisfied, I needed a new Justin Bieber single to fuel my addiction. My prayers were answered with the release of Never say Never. My parents refused to buy it for me. They believed I was too obsessed with the first one and knew that buying the latest one would only make my obsession worse. This devestated me. I NEEDED that single, I felt like an alcoholic going through withdrawl. I lost all of my spirit, I had trouble sleeping at night, and sometimes I would experience hallucinations where Justin was in the room with me. I begged my parents every day, but they wouldn't budge. I felt I had lost the will to live. Thankfully, I got the single. I aquired it the same way every kid got something that they wanted but their parents wouldn't buy for them, Grandma. I was overjoyed, finally I could experience the masterpiece that is known as Justin Bieber - Never say Never. This time he was accompanied by Jaden Smith! I was delighted. I listened to this single, and memorised it like I had the original. By now I had lost contact with society, I didn't talk to anybody at school, I had no friends, and I never left the house. This didn't bother me though, in fact I preferred it that way. Just as I started to get bored of that single, Boyfriend came out. My obsession had hit an all-time high, I was amazed at the quality of that single. We now had Justin Bieber, Lucardis and Jaden Smith. They were my friends, or \"The Gang\" as I called them. My parents were scared of me now. If they tried to take the music away from me, I would throw a tantrum and break things until they gave it back. No amount of reasoning, counseling, or Native American rituals could change me, because by now Justin Bieber had was not just an obsession, but a lifestyle. I lived and breathed Justin Bieber. But then came the dark days, no Justin Bieber singles were coming out. RBMG labels had stopped supporting Justin Bieber, and had launched Korean PSY. I didn't have his single Gangnam Style, but that didn't matter. No new Justin Bieber singles were coming out. There were rumors, but the only one that ever turned out to be true was All That Matters. I saw it as an abomination, how could RBMG do this to Justin Bieber? After several years I had just about given up. I would often times cry myself to sleep, believing that RBMG had given up on the teenage idol that I had come to adore. I wrote my own stories about Bieber, fanfictions about him having a relationship with Jaden Smith, but they weren't enough. But then it happened. I was at the grocery store with my mother, when I saw it: A magazine with a picture of a new model of DVD player plastered right on the cover. I begged my mom to buy it for me, and she did, relieved that I wanted something that wasn't Justin Bieber related, or so she thought. I read the articles about the upcoming DVD player, and then I saw what I have been wanting to see for years, a new Justin Bieber item was in the works, and it was full-lenght MOVIE too! My life had a purpose again. When the day finally came, I was there. I was the first in line, I had convinced poor old Grandma to buy it for me, and I made sure I got a copy of Justin Bieber - Never say Never. If the singles on the CD's amazed me, Never say Never left me speechless. The imagery was such good quality, the story so deep, the music blew me away. This was the way Justin Bieber was meant to be. It rekindled the fire that had laid dormant in me that is Justin Bieber. I wrote more fanfiction, I made my own fancharacters and I even shipped them. Then I realized something, Justin Bieber wasn't just a teen idol on TV, He was a part of me. I became one with Justin Bieber. If you want to be like me and know what truly matters in life, I fully recommend listening to Justin Bieber. Justin Bieber is more than just a teen idol pop star, Justin Bieber is a way of life.",

His grandparents were normal, very much like my daughters, in the respect they kept him grounded. He had to clean his room before he could go out with his friends-didn't matter that he was JUSTIN BEIBER. His grandfather brought me to tears, talking of letting them go, Justin & his mom, to Atlanta to do recordings & start his singing career. I did wonder what Justin's father's intentions really were, never around in any pictures while he was growing up past a few months old...all the credit should go to his mom, grandparents & his crew who loves & adores him. I do wish it would have stayed with him in it's entirety of his songs but his journey thus far was portrayed very nicely. Loved the hair wisp & the part about texting.",
