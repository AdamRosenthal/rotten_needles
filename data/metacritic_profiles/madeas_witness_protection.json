      "text": "Not your typical Madea movie/screen play and one Tyler Perry actually did well at capturing. You wont find that much christian overtones or black woman drama this time around as it involves a white family in need of some help. The whole plot is summed up in the trailer and hidden underneath is a small episode of black drama involving a Pastor's son and church money lost to the bank. Being as this is a Madea movie, the family is about as \"white bread\" as they come and as a white man I will raise my hand first and say \"yes, that is how we is.\" Also typical of a Madea movie, the good parts do not occur until she enters the scene which means waiting a good 30min until she hits the stage front and center. This time around Perry puts her in early with a few scenes to help set the stage then lets her go full blast in the second act. From then on its mostly her but for a change of pace Joe makes a huge scene in this movie and he is funny as hell. The downside of the movie is that it is a typical Tyler Perry Madea movie and it is almost expected as to what ol' Mabel Simmons is going to do but there is at least one scene where her character does the opposite of what would be expected of her. Also it's a bunch of white people in a black comedy which usually ends up making them a joke but in toning it down a bit Perry took a gamble and at times during the movie it worked, and at other times is made them very bland and boring. I would have loved to see more down with Joe and the grandmother (played by Doris Roberts) or Madea and George's daughter. Throughout the movie there were scenes involving the pastor's son and every time he popped up I thought to myself \"oh yeah, him\" because so much comedy is happening before and after his short scenes that you forget his story is part of the movie or that he's actually involved some how.",

Sadly, though, John Amos' role is so poorly written he practically disappears and Marla Gibbs does disappear except for her name in the credits.  Eugene Levy's performance hits one-note, there's no chemistry between him and Denise Richards, and Doris Roberts seems to have escaped from a zombie festival.    A very uneven film.",
