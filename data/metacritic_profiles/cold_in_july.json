Hall, Sam Shepherd, and a rejuvenated Don Johnson, sporting an off-kilter 80s-esque electro score, and an engaging plot ripe with welcomely subverting turns in direction, Cold in July will probably go down (unfortunately) as one of the most underrated films of the year. True, the film adds little new context to the repercussions of violence and the expectations of masculinity that impose upon simple men. There is also a kind of corn-brained logic to some of the plot twists, but it never comes across as ridiculous, more campy and fun. If I had to compare this film tonally to something else from this year, Blue Ruin comes to mind, as well as the Nicolas Cage vehicle, Joe. While not nearly as seamless in presenting it's thrills as Blue Ruin or emotionally resonant as Joe, Cold in July still earns merit for being a competently made thriller that has characters more rich than we've come to expect from the genre, as well as an unbridled momentum that builds to a (albeit, predictable) satisfying finale.

      "text": "Cold in July is a fantastic crime thriller from director Jim Mickie with outstanding performances from Michael C. Hall and Sam Shephard. Mickie does a great job wringing tension out of the premise and the end result is that the viewer is constantly on pins and needles awaiting the next twist the film is going to take. Once you think you have a grasp on where the film is headed, it frequently pulls the rug out from under you and changes course yet again. The film is incredibly detailed, right down to the different filters on the film, which transition from blue to gold to red in the film. It is really the defining factor in why this film has really fantastic look. The cinematography ain't too shabby either though. Overall, Cold in July is not perfect, but it is the exact kind of film that crime thriller fans are looking for and, beyond that, it is incredibly well crafted and is one that will definitely stick with you for a bit.",

      "text": "Disappointing to say the least despite having a trailer which makes it look so exciting. The scenario is very promising, beginning as it does with a house burglary that is not all it seems to be, and one settles down to enjoy what should have been an accomplished thriller. Unfortunately, edge of seat thrills are what is sadly lacking. Scenes start promisingly enough, but tension is never sufficiently generated and the film sinks under a morass of unfulfilled expectation. There are twists and turns along the way, but these are not handled skilfully enough to make the film a winner and only a couple of moments come close to creating any kind of frisson. To be fair the last 20 minutes, although very violent, offer some compensation. Overall, though, one is left feeling well and truly underwhelmed by it all.",

Micheal C. hall plays a family man with a wife and child, and he is a good man, but one night he hears a nose in the house and he goes to check it out by bringing a gun with him; he saw a mysterious man with a flashlight look at his family photos so Micheal C. hall points a gun at the stranger a shouts him by mistake, and throw out the movie he has to deal with some big problems and he has to risk everything to try to make everything right. The music in this movie is like a electric rock music that works so well in this movie that it reminds me of the drive soundtrack. The acting is freaking brilliant in this movie and the directing is outstanding in this movie.",
