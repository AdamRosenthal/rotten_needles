      "text": "Pinpointing the exact moment where Julia Roberts became a star in Garry Marshall's \"Pretty Woman\" was a tangible instant, a light source, previously unseen, suddenly emanating from the jacuzzi. It was Julia singing \"Kiss\", out of tune and out to charm, punctuated with kissing noises, that set the Steel Magnolia apart from the other Magnolias and Mystics. Emma Stone, last seen in \"Zombieland\", now seen in \"Easy A\", has a moment like that, when the earworm(Natasha Bedington's \"Pocketful of Sunshine\") which enters Olive's head, slowly and surely burrows deeper and deeper over the course of a lonely weekend, with perfect editing, Wes Anderson-like titles, and the right shaggy mutt, shows how singing some disposable, yet insinuatingly catchy pop song can turn into a compulsion, a temporary full-blown neurosis, and a cure for the blues, while, of course, charming the pants off the audience. Stone plays a virgin, Olive Pendergast, who is made to feel inadequate by the sexual exploits of her worldly best friend Rhiannon(Aly Michalka), two girls, the virgin and the whore, who aren't all that dissimilar from their twentieth-century counterparts played by Thora Birch and Mena Suvari in Sam Mendes' \"American Beauty\". In the Mendes film, the friendship sours the moment Jane(Birch) embarks on a love affair with Ricky(Wes Bentley), an unexpected development that intimidates the usually undauntable Angela(Suvari), since as it turns out, her boastful talk about wanting to do \"it\" with Jane's father is all an act. She's a virgin too, like Rhiannon, perhaps, which would explain why the daughter of nudists would turn against Olive, when the purported wild girl should be thrilled to have a partner-in-crime(ala Nicky Reed and Evan Rachel Wood in Catherine Hardwicke's \"Thirteen\": the mother played by Patricia Clarkson has a little Holly Hunter in her). Previously, with bravado and post-feminist glee, Rhiannon squeals in delight upon learning that her caller ID name on Olive's cell phone is \"big t**s\", a sure indication that Olive may have a body image problem, as Jane did in \"American Beauty\", when she explores the possibility of breast implants. She feels like a \"plain Jane\", so does Olive, that's why the good girl turns \"bad\"; the good girl feels the pressure to compete, but the moviegoer may want to hedge his/her bets that the good girl may be in a one-woman race against a c*cktease. Who can forget the scene between Suvari and Kevin Spacey, when the jailbait temptress reverts back into a quivering schoolgirl, as Lester gets ready to ravish her. (He didn't realize the rose petals in his sex fantasy about Angela, signified a deflowering.) As played by Spacey, Lester Burnham had no morals. Whereas in \"Easy A\", the English teacher played by Thomas Haden Church, is kept in check by some girls(Amanda Bynes is their queen bee) who belong to an on-campus church group. Sanctimonious and annoying as they may appear to be, the moviegoer should be aware of the sexual overtones, albeit Victorian ones, which makes Nathaniel Hawthorne's \"The Scarlet Letter\" a fairly incendiary book; a book that could be employed to help seduce a bright and naive female student by some unscrupulous teacher. The wife's affair with a male student is treated like a surprise plot twist, suggesting that the transgression was supposed to occur between Olive and Mr. Griffith. But alas, while Christian values take its lumps, Christian values save the day; saves the teacher's job, because Olive never does turn into Hester Prynne, never commits adultery. The \"A\" stitched to her dress signifies nothing; it's merely a fashion accessory. She never does get that easy \"A\" from the English teacher. She's a good girl. And that's progress. Back in 1990, to be America's Sweetheart, Julia Roberts played the hooker with a heart of gold, whereas Emma Stone, in a long line of heir apparents since then, plays a fake hooker who takes the fake orgasm to the next level.",

Michalka was hilarious, and definitely proved she's not a Disney Channel girl anymore. Her other friend/crush is Penn Badgely (The Stepfather), as Woodchuck Todd. His performance was bland and boring, however unique in a way where his humor was dry, yet funny. Her final friend is Brandon, played by Dan Byrd (Cougar Town) is her homosexual friend, who fakes having sex with Olive to earn popularity points. Although he was only in the movie for about 8-10 minutes, Byrd's performance was very gay. I guess that's good acting.... Her enemies are pretty much the entire school Christian club, but Marianne, played by Amanda Bynes (Sydney White) is her main nemesis, who also starts the entire rumor of her losing her virginity. Bland and boring, this is Bynes' last... and worst acting role she has ever done. Thomas Haden Church (Spider Man 3), Lisa Kudrow (Hotel For Dogs), and Malcolm McDowell (Halloween 2), play school faculty members, who are very funny.

The characters are all one dimensional stereotypes.  The acting sucked.  I thought Emma Stone's performance was particularly weak and definitely bordered on unwatchable.  The only decent actor in the film is Malcolm McDowell but he is only in like 2 or 3 scenes.  Sort of like a desperate attempt to give the film some credibility.  Maybe he owed someone a favor.  Lisa Kudrow looked gross and very old.  I have a hard time believeiing an attractive high school student would want anything to do with her.  There is a very strong anti-gay message in the film.  They tried to dress it up a little so people could watch it without feeling like a scumbag but in my opinion they failed.  Also the movie is not funny.  However, it does have the mechanic from Wings in it!!!!",

Emma Stone is believable in her role though this must be one heck of a small or conservative school for her to be considered a \"slut\" for supposedly sleeping with one guy. A couple of things that bothered me about this film were that Olive is somehow invited to a party thrown by the most popular girl in school, yet she is by her own admission invisible and thus would likely not be known by the popular girl. I guess you could say once she takes on her Easy A persona she becomes known, but still it didn't make much sense to me. Another thing was the scene with Evan (the fat kid), come on that's just not realistic at all. We all know hot chicks would never be interested in a fat guy. And then with Todd, isn't it convenient that Olive's window just happens to open when Todd comes to see her? And after her talking about wanting to be asked out and all of this as far as I can recall he never actually asked her out, he just showed up with his speakers and the lawnmower and she comes down and jumps into his arms and kisses him, like they've been dating for years or something. Not realistic at all there. Another random thing that bugged me was Olive's friend, that girl was super annoying. And then she had the nerve to get pissed at Olive for going on a date with the guy she liked when we later find out that she kissed the guy Olive liked. Sorry sweetie, you don't get to have it both ways. Overall, a decent movie, but not great. It had it's funny moments, but also portrays things unrealistically at times.",

After watching Easy A, I came away with a lot of mix emotions about the movie and events that happened throughout the movie. This movie was funny to watch but as a Christian it really went against my world view. This movie is about a girl who pretends to have sex with the most unlikely of students. She never really had sex with any of the boys but she would make up a sex story for the boys to spread around to help the boys reputation through the school. She would receive money and gift cards for what she would do or in this case not do with the boys. This movie totally throws out the whole idea of saving sex for the marriage.  Even though she may not have had sex with the boys, she gave off the idea that she was. The movie title just is one example of how she has affected her life now, Easy A. through her actions she was telling the school that she was easy when it came to a sexual relationship. Sex was created by God as a blessing and throughout this movie, sex was thought of as something not special and not a blessing.
