      "text": "Deliver Us From Evil artistically and successfully commingles two routinely disparate film genres: police crime drama and paranormal horror. Scott Derrickson skillfully and realistically captures the dark ambience common to both in powerful ways (via the depiction of aversive elemental and environmental settings; an absence of light; an absence of sound; an ominous musical score; and initially disbelieving characters driven to self-discovering belief through their exposure to overwhelming events). The film's portrayal of police tactics, dialogue and procedures is spot-on and its descriptive narration on uncommon subject matter such as primary evil, diabolical oppression, and possession is likewise noteworthy. Moreover, the explicit detail provided on the six stages embodying every genuine exorcism could have been given by the Jesuit Exorcist, Malachi Martin, himself. I give this film a 5 Star rating and predict that it will soon join both The Exorcist(1973) and The Exorcism of Emily Rose(2006) as cinema's ultimate expression of the preternatural realm at work in the real world.",

Unfortunately that didn't fly because I'm a firm believer in majority rule and upon the mention of \"Deliver Us From Evil\", my buddies jumped at the opportunity for something new as opposed to something we already liked. Usually I'm all in for a horror movie, and if you know me you know that I'm a huge horror buff. I love it, no, thrive on it! Games, movies, television... Comics? Maybe. Though regardless of my horror obsession and the weird need to be frightened every once in a while, I'm getting sick of the demonic possession movies. This is especially the case with those that are \"Inspired By [insert name or event here]\", which is exactly what this film is. Honestly, I'm beginning to think that all of these \"Inspired By\" stories come from schizophrenics who are paid by film writers to go on about what they 'saw'.",

      "text": "Considering how difficult it is to find a decent modern exorcism flick, it's always nice to find one that will be a visceral and sometimes scary ride. Deliver Us from Evil is one of those movies. Sinister director Scott Derrickson takes the helm of this cop procedural turned possession film Deliver Us from Evil which is based on NYPD sergeant Ralph Sarchie's allegedly \"non-fiction\" novel Beware the Night. I believe that this is based on true events about as much as I believe that The Conjuring and The Amityville Horror movies are \"based on true events\", but let's just roll with it. In Deliver Us from Evil, NYPD sergeant Ralph Sarchie, played by Eric Bana, teams up with a priest schooled in the rites of exorcism to investigate a series of crimes around their city. What makes this movie so much different than other exorcism movies is that it is primarily a cop procedural. A lot of the twists and thrills come from Sarchie investigating these crimes and finding new information and evidence, making this a uniquely gritty possession film. Deliver Us from Evil mostly thrives on the unpredictability of the plot rather than gross-out scares, Scott Derrickson's direction also allows some dense atmosphere throughout the entire film. Unfortunately, there are quite a few unnecessary jump scares littered throughout the movie. Some of the jump scares do actually work, but for every one that works, there are two more that fail miserably. It's the biggest drawback to an otherwise good film. Deliver Us from Evil, despite some horror cop-outs (pun definitely intended), is a gritty and surprisingly entertaining exorcism flick that should surprise and even scare you.",
