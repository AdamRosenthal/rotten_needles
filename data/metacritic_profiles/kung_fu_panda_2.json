The way the Furious five and our Dragon warrior fought was spectacular. I was looking forward to see if the villan (Shen)  would be as much as evil and hardcore, since Tai Lung (in the first movie) was the perfect bad guy. Again, he was a bad-ass villan, even better than Tai Lung. Also, this movie delivers a great message. Not only the kids will love this movie, the adults to. It's the perfect family movie.",

      "text": "Tigress looks away, out of embarrassment and understanding, when she sees a miniaturized replica of herself, an action figure that the goose mistakenly believes his son had left behind while packing for Gongmen City. Knowing chuckles from her teammates break out. Just because a stark-raving mad **** with a genocidal streak is threatening to blow up all of China to kingdom come, it doesn't mean that the Furious Five can't poke fun at their exceedingly uptight friend, for levity's sake. True enough, Lord Shen means serious business. The cannon that he developed could be curtains for kung fu, but how can they not laugh at the appearance of the Tigress doll, and what it signifies to a panda bear who is old enough to breed, yet can't do anything about it, since he's the last of his species, purportedly? The Viper is also female, but even though interspecies love can and does occur with relative frequency, the tigress, with her mammalian(as opposed to reptilian) charms, probably wins by default. Mr. Ping, just like any parent of a teenager, is worried about his son's sex drive, so maybe it's actually a calculated move on the father's part to infantilize Po, therefore making him less attractive as a potential mating partner. In \"Kung Fu Panda\", the goose seems well-aware of his son's fantasy life. Sounding more like a henpecking mother than a father, the bird asks loudly, \"What are you doing up there?\" from the kitchen in their humble abode, when he hears suspicious noises emanating from the bear's room. The sound that piques his imagination is that of a prostrated panda with major weight issues, struggling to get up from the floor. From this most humbling of beginnings, things turn around real fast for this morbidly obese bear. Other than being a tribute to the \"wuxia\" genre, \"Kung Fu Panda\" may be the most inspirational movie about big people since \"Angus\". Later on in the first film, the battle of the bulge, a losing battle, the result of a gluttonous appetite, greatly undermines Po's ability to fulfill his destiny as the Dragon Warrior, as he eats Shi Fu out of house and home while training at the vaunted academy under his tutelage. Unfairly, the Furious Five take issue with the fact that their savior, the chosen one who will lead them into battle with Tai Lung, can't fight, let alone, get an unobstructed view of his toes. So prejudicial are their feelings toward Po's perceived weight problem, this insular group talks freely about their leader while he's within earshot, not realizing that to another panda bear, or a pack, Po is the right size. \"Kung Fu Panda 2\", however, delves into the backstory as to how a goose ended up raising a bear, and in the process, shows us that Po's ungainly weight problem is a matter of nurture, not nature. When Ping discovers the panda cub mixed-up with the radish delivery outside his noodle shop, the restauranter overfeeds Po, because, in all likelihood, he was fattening the bear up. The iconography is straight out of \"Hansel & Gretel\". As he eats, Po sits in a pot, the prelude to a date with the oven. In \"Kung Fu Panda\"(starring Jack Black, the David Carradine of \"yellow-voice\"), when Ping tells his son that the secret ingredient is \"nothing\", he's lying. The secret ingredient is animals. \"Broth runs deep in our veins,\" he says, meaning blood. Unbeknownst to Po, the goose makes him complicit to the enterprise of meat. It's as if Orwell wrote the script for \"Soylent Green\". Upon hearing this startling revelation, Po, in return, cracks the riddle of the sacred scroll, which enigmatically, turns out to be blank. Likewise, nothing. That is how the evil snow leopard interprets the document, reflecting as it does his own image of himself, which also denotes the attitude of the goose towards the furry creatures who inhabit the Valley of Peace, panda included. The sequel reminds us that Po belongs to the ethnography of animals, not bears, so he is fat, as defined by mainstream cultural norms. Lucky for this lowland community, the dragon warrior misinterprets his father, and fulfills his destiny. In the sequel, Ping adds tofu to the menu, whereas in the original film, he dismisses the very idea. Now that the goose uses Po's celebrity to promote the noodle shop, he can afford to go vegetarian. Po is still fat by non-panda bear standards, but the cachet of being the dragon warrior more than offsets those extra unsightly pounds. On the boat, on the heels of being humiliated in front of the tigress, the fairer Bengal finds Po struggling with inner peace, as he bangs his head against the mast. She tells him, \"The mast is not a worthy opponent,\" then offers him her open palm. \"I'm ready,\" the tigress says(read: romantic love is better than self-love). But a scared Po replies, \"I think I prefer the mast.\" After he takes down the ****, however, it's the tigress's turn to be shy. During some kung fu hugging, her body stiffens.",

      "text": "Kung Fu Panda 2 is big, hearty and incredibly funny animation sequel. There's more at stake this time round with Po (Jack Black) and the Furious Five not only fighting to save China from the tyrannical Lord Shen (Gary Oldman), but we also delve into Po's mysterious past, and shed some light on why his father is a goose. The animation is still superb, and has clearly stepped up a level to deal with the more complex action set-pieces and a huge variety of beautifully rendered environments. Black seems to have found his ideal role in Po the panda, and the character remains endearing on his second outing. Angelina Jolie again impresses as the introverted Tigress, as does Hoffman's stoic Master Shifu (though his role is sadly reduced this time around). The all-star cast voicing the other members of the Furious Five (Jackie Chan, Lucy Liu, Seth Rogen and David Cross) thankfully have a little more to do than in the first film, Gary Oldman adds another great villain to his repertoire as resentful, power-hungry **** Lord Shen, and Michelle Yeoh has fun as an elderly goat soothsayer. James Hong is once again the best thing in the film as Po's dad Mr. Ping - his relationship with Po is tender and believable, and Hong manages to perfectly balance the elements of comedy and tragedy in his character. Though there's more scope for genuine drama in this film than in the first, it has lost a little of its charm in this second outing, and though it's only a couple of minutes longer than the first installment, it feels considerably more so as the plot does drag a little in places. While the exploration of Po's history is good for character development, it does at times cause the main story to lose momentum, a problem the first film, with it's much more linear plot, never suffered. I also feel the film's finale takes the whole \"inner peace\" message behind the story's martial arts elements a little too far, and the very final shot of the film is simply a narrative cop-out designed purely to set up a sequel. Even so. Kung Fu Panda 2 is a thoroughly respectable sequel that often equals and sometimes even surpasses the successes of its predecessor. It looks gorgeous, is fun and action-packed, with some good jokes and nice emotional kicks.",

Just watching the beginning, I already knew what was going to happen next, even half-way through the movie I know already Po's going to beat this guy. Also, the movie felt short. Well, put those issues aside and you got a decent family film. Just wish they did more than this, and I don't mean by adding more comedy. Just put more focus on the plot, action, and more imagination. A simple story about the main character's past isn't really surprising to the audience 'cause it has already been done numerous times.",
