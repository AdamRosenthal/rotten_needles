Most people in the Holocaust who survived did so based on luck; the outcome was generally the same whether the person fought or didn't fight the Nazis.  So to see a film about a woman and her lawyer who took on the Austrian government to fight for what was rightfully hers was such a wonderful balance to that sense of helplessness that many people felt.  The acting in this film was excellent, the character development of both the main actress and the lawyer was well done, and the portrayal of those in authority in the Austrian government concurred with what I understand to be the governmental attitude in Austria after WWII.  I really hope that this film is nominated for some awards, especially for the acting.  I teared up the full length of the movie.",

This is also the story of her attorney, Randy Schoenberg (played by Ryan Reynolds) and the legal machinations put in Ms. Altmann\u2019s path by a Viennese government dedicated to the retention of its \"Mona Lisa\", as it colloquially referred to this revered work of art. More than anything, this film, directed by Simon Curtis and written by Alexi Kaye Campbell, is about justice and those who will give their all to achieve it. Ms. Mirren plays her role with the dignity and dedication that the real life subject no doubt possessed.  The film is engrossing and well paced and one need not be an attorney to follow and understand, the legal niceties it contains. One can talk about millions who were brutalized by the members of the Third Reich but the impact of the crimes they committed becomes even greater when the story is told about one person and one piece of property. I give the film an 8 for its ability to relate the horror and hopelessness the victims of Nazi tyranny experienced as their dignity, their possessions and, yes, their very lives were  taken from them.",

Helen Mirren's performance is excellent though I believe it could have been written better as it Her role in this feels like a cross between Judy Dench from Philomenia and a character from The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel. I will say however i did enjoy this film on a lot of levels i just can't say on technical levels that it is a completely good movie though i do believe it should have a higher score from critics on Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic",

In fact, the hard truth is that the movie's this year's annual Holocaust movie clearly made by the Israel Lobby neocon wing of Hollywood to keep the American masses Pavlovian suckers for \"Never again!\" so that when the neocons roll it out again to con the American masses into supporting Tom Cotton's proxy war for Israel for \"regime change\" in Iran, the suckers will bite yet again, in an uncontrollable reflex that has been brilliantly drilled into them by Israel Lobby Hollywood for so many years now for just such an occasion. The attention to Pavlovian detail is such that they've made the heroine father look just like Stefan Zweig! How's that for tugging at the heartstrings of the literate, the ones most in danger of dismissing the movie for its shameless manipulations. Nothing is harder to make a good film about than the Holocaust, because any work of art has to avoid cliches and stock responses like the plague. Manipulative schlock like Woman in Gold does NOTHING but trade in both. It looks so good, and Mirren's such a good actress that the film might strike the unwary as better than it is.

The film tells the true story of Maria Altmann (played by Mirren) an Austrian woman who fought to reclaim Gustav Klimt\u2019s now famous portrait of her aunt Adele Bloch-Bauer, which was taken by the Nazis before World War II began. Reynolds plays Randy Schoenberg, Altmann\u2019s lawyer. Daniel Bruhl and Katie Holmes have supporting roles in this film but are fairly underused. Mirren and Reynolds\u2019 performances are really the only two in this film that matter. They are really the only two essential characters. Mirren was great throughout the whole film playing a woman who just wants the one thing that reminds her of the life she once had. I have not seen many of Mirren\u2019s performances because she generally stars in lesser known projects that don\u2019t always get a lot of attention, but her performance in this film interests me to see some of her other projects. Ryan Reynolds is better in this film than I expected and hopefully he will be able to able to continue to improve with Self/Less which comes out this month and more importantly when he plays Deadpool next year. At the beginning it looked like he may have been miscast because he seemed to be dragging down the dialogue. It is so hard not to associate him with the romantic comedies that he is known for. However as the movie goes along he improves steadily and by the end I thought it was one of his greatest performances. Woman in Gold is certainly a slow film and the story is fairly dull. I think the film could have been a bit more inspirational and the movie goes by quick without really delivering a memorable plot. There is also little development with the characters and I felt like I hardly knew them even when the movie ended. Woman in Gold is certainly not a terrible movie but will not be suitable for a casual movie fan.",

I did not know Tatiana Maslany was in it until yesterday, when I was watching it VOD. I did know the subject matter and was interested in that from the beginning.  Watching the film, I was often teary eyed. And I was reminded of how dreadfully people were treated by the Nazis in Austria. The writing was strong enough; I was glad for the flashbacks; but watching, and thinking about it in retrospect, I have concerns about the casting. First, Ryan Reynolds was not the right actor for his role as the young lawyer. He didn't look right, sound right, and he was not able to show the kind of passion or complexity that the role required or should have required. I felt almost that his part was written down to fit his limitations as an actor. (In fact, the show felt underwritten overall.)  Now, I will say something controversial, although as this little review will likely never be read, maybe not so much!  I am active in supporting greater representation of non-white actors in film and television, and am sensitive especially to what the activists call 'white washing'. This is where the role of a South Asian hero, for example, is played by a white actor for his presumed greater box office appeal. I get the realities of Hollywood. But on this one, I wonder about the grandson of a famous Austrian Jewish composer, Schoenberg, being played by Ryan Reynolds, to my knowledge not Jewish. Other than movie star power, what did he bring to this film? He didn't even bring a back ground in synch with that of the character to draw upon. And he just isn't that strong an actor.  Helen Mirren is Helen Mirren of course, but not Jewish. Her experience does however encompass loss of country though, as her father was White Russian who because of the Russian Revolution became British. Tatian Maslany is apparently not of Jewish background but is of German-Austrian-Ukrainian background, her mother was an immigrant, and has fluent German. (And was wonderful in the role.)  But I keep wondering about the decision to cast Ryan Reynolds. Other than box office, there is nothing about him as an actor or a human being that seems to fit the character. Maybe the real Randy Schoenberg was really bland, lacking in passion, and not a particularly good public speaker?",

I enjoyed the story, the performances, and the overall production.  I guess the critics wanted more machine gun fire?  What a refreshing change to watch an engaging true story with beautiful and historic locales, poignant moments throughout, and a satisfying conclusion.  I tip my hat to the cast and crew of this movie and Mr. Weinstein.  It would be nice if Hollywood could give the viewing public more movies like this and less of the action over-dosed violent coming attractions that preceded this excellent film.",

      "text": "I enjoyed this movie, feeling that it covered the complexity of the situation fairly well.  Most of us will admit the Holocaust was horrible in terms of lives lost but people seem to brush aside the stories of the survivors because they were the lucky ones who lived. Neglecting the irreparable emotional damage that was done.  It was refreshing to have a Holocaust movie that 1) demonstrated the emotional damage 2) did not need to hammer in the message by showing emaciated victims and gas chambers.  The reviews attacking Mrs. Altmann's action and story to be wholly insensitive and full of malice, criticising the film based on a true story because of the actual story is ridiculous.",

The mix of flashbacks with the present were done very well. I got the movie because my wife wanted to see it but was surprised by good it was. Definitely one of the best movies I've seen recently.",
