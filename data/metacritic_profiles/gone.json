But gone are the memorable characters and unforgettable performances, gone are the psychological insights and sexual undercurrent, and gone are the atmosphere of evil and looming menace.  At least they got the title right.  Jill's methodology holds the film's interest.  She knows that people rarely believe her when she tells the truth about the abduction of herself or her sister, so she tells them lies they'll believe instead, whatever sob story it takes to get information out of her mark.  She's not a legendary hacker or deductive sleuth; she's a pathological liar in search of the truth.  While how it gets there holds interest, the story of Gone arrives at familiar beats; a betrayal as the film goes into the final stretch (from a character we haven't met yet), a high-speed car chase heralds the climax.  The film runs on borrowed parts from better films (Silence of the Lambs) and lesser films (Kiss the Girls), and suffers from a lack of invention.  Without proper setup, the film does not payoff to what little it builds up to, leaving a feeling of wanting more from 90 minute's investment.",

Better yet, avoid it all together, I forgot, this is a tv movie. What foreign film director, Hector Dhalia, and writer Allison Burnett (  \"My Date with Drew,\" \"Feast of Love,\" \"Underworld Awakening,\") have here is an idea, so unoriginally effete, hence the title, and so flimsly executed, that the on-screen action is not the least bit engaging; audiences are drawn more keenly, instead, to a Portland setting that is as much a let-down in wasted horror potential as the film's beginning, middle, and end--all negligibly trite. Specifically, the film hands Seyfried a script that unrelentlessly smothers her; she is neither talented, convincing, or intersted enough to pull it off. As the viewer watches her become an instantaneous crime virtuoso, suddenly equipped with seemingly extensive investigative experience in a knee-jerk's time, they are left sitting, waiting, wondering, how, what is unfolding is even constructed into a film idea; it's mindless. And, the sight of her large, nefarious sea-greem eyes amidst her cutting brow line and biting lips is what the attention of the view is supplanted with; an expression that almost seems to cry \"wolf,\" only this time...sincerely. As for the other characters, they are carelessly under-developed and delineated so dimly, that their dialogue sounds more read-like than memorized: drop the note-cards guys, this isn't high school speech class anymore. Ultimately, \"Gone\" is a poorly-written, even more poorly-acted, straight-to-tv movie that hands its protagonist, innately incapable of rendering the least adroitness, a script that is so disconnected with her abilities that she essentially rolls over and sits down; the effort is colorlessly drawn. Filled with one-liners all too familiar to the genre such as \"Just go home and get some sleep,\" replied with \"I'll sleep when he's dead,\" makes the film's subject matter more a liability than a component of entertainment. Instead, \"Gone's\" characters mewl, \"Mom, do we have to?\" No need to check the temperature of this failure; it's dead.",

      "text": "Gone 7/10. When I read reviews about this movie people went on about all the twists and turns this movie takes, but to be honest, I can't think of one single plot twist in this movie, it's pretty straight forward. And while I'm a big fan of plot twists and surprises, I still enjoyed Gone a lot. One thing it does right is suspense, there were times when I really feared the main character was in some serious danger, especially that lamb to the slaughter type ending it had, on one hand you think she'll be alright, on the other you think she's pretty much dead. I liked the ending a lot, it highlights how ****ty cops are at their jobs.",

Unfortunately, where excitement should have been it was nothing but a boring movie that we had to force ourselves to finish.",

      "text": "8/10 for this film. I enjoyed this film but there are some plot holes and some of the twists don't make sense. The one guy who actually does believe her seems to be the suspect but then suddenly this new guy comes out of nowhere. Those twists and holes are the reason I am giving this an 8 instead of a 10. But if you can get over that stuff it is a really enjoyable film.",
