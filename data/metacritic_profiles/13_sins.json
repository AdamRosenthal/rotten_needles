      "text": "It really bothers me when I like a film that is clearly a rip off of another film. 13 Sins is nothing more than a horror writers take on 12 Rounds. There are no wrestlers in this one, although I'm pretty sure Ron Perlman would have made a great one. This film is about a game, millionaires have played for decades, a game that has become more prolific and a lot more fun, with the advent of modern technology. A seemingly random person receives a call telling them that they've been selected for a game show. The subject completes simple tasks and starts earning money, but as the prize goes up, so does the danger. Once the subject is a wanted felon, they must finish the game and earn the grand prize or they could be spending the rest of their lives behind bars. Veteran character actor, Mark Webber, stars in 13 Sins and he was a very odd choice for a leading man. Webber is this small nerdy guy, who seems like he wouldn't be the type to play this game, no matter the reward. Like many others, Webber is suckered in an soon becomes a wanted man, he is being chased by a local detective, played by Ron Perlman. The casting created a very awkward dynamic, as the \"good guy\" is this huge scary guy, and the \"bad guy\" is this little nerdy guy, but somehow it works. 13 Sins is certainly more horrific and crazy than 12 Rounds was, however the similarities between the two are so similar that I'm surprised WWE Films didn't attempt to halt it's release. I loved the idea of 12 Rounds and 13 Sins is just taking the same idea to an extreme, but despite the clear similarities, and the odd choice of casting, it's still a thrilling film that was definitely entertaining.",

I like going to these movies where you haven\u2019t really seen any previews of them and don\u2019t really don\u2019t what they are about. It\u2019s a nice surprise when they turn out to be good like this. I never got bored and there were parts in the movie that made me sit up and bite my nails and even on the edge of my seat a little. It\u2019s about a guy who\u2019s down on his luck who gets contacted by \u201csomeone\u201d to play a Game where he can profit greatly. I know you\u2019ve heard this type of concept before like \u201cThe Game\u201d and \u201cThe Box\u201d. Even though this was a lower budget movie, I actually liked this better than those. I think it gave you just enough info to intrigue you unlike \u201cThe Box\u201d where I didn\u2019t really get it at the end and \u201cThe Game\u201d that wrapped everything up to neat and tidy. You have enough questions to keep you talking about it after wards, but not so many questions where you give up on it. It has Ron Pearlman in it and Rutina Wesley from \u201cTrue Blood too\u201d. There was one scene where I almost covered my eyes and another where my friend said it was almost to gross for him to look at. Maybe not one you\u2019d see in a theater over Noah and Captain America, but definitely rent this one or see it in a bargain theater.",

Now while I get all that, I didn't like how the movie ended, I mean, the guy ended up killing his brother and decided to turn down the money in the end. It didn't seem like it would happen in reality - I mean, he just went through a lot, killed his brother, his father died etc, and he is having a kid soon with his wife.
