I think that he did a goog job considering the source to take a choreopoem and translate it to the screen is not easy..Please read the original. In the play I don't think the characters had names they were identified by colors. The abuses that the women in this play faced happens everyday...I see it on the news everyone of them with the exception of the back alley abortion. Tyler Perry heart is dark...well he was abused so maybe that's why he is so open to bringing abuse to the forefront. As far as someone not liking the title well the play is called For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When The Rainbow Is Enuff research Ntazke Shange and see why her heart is so dark and why she titled her choreopoem that. Tyler Perry good job",

Having read the book it was easy to tell when they were quoting directly from it and when the script strayed. The dialogue is poetic and musical when it follows the book - the movie would have befitted from fewer additional scenes or storylines. Loretta Devine eats up the screen in every scene she appears in especially the ones that follow the book. Kimberly Elise is another standout - her final scene is gut wrenching. When she utters the word \"fiercely\" it is reminiscent of Cicely Tyson in Sounder crying \"Nathan\" - that same trascending quality when you forget you're watching a movie and really believe what you are watching. The final scene makes up for any flaws in this wonderful heartfelt movie.",

      "text": "Jo hates the ghetto, just hates it, but Crystal(Kimberly Elise), the editor-in-chief's personal assistant at Robe Rouge magazine, left behind some important company documents in her tenement apartment, so the fashion magazine maven drives the \"colored\" woman home, and waits inside a chauffeur-driven car, seething with contempt for \"places like this\", while business is attended to. Within the next few minutes, Jo will discover that the ghetto hates her back, equally, angry at this haughty woman's stance against her own kind, when the ghetto condition takes hold of a war veteran's mind, compelling Crystal's boyfriend to dangle their two young children, over the pavement, from an open window. The ghetto will remind this woman that she's colored, too, with an act so heinous, no ordinary words can describe it, so poetry is called in to do the job. He lets go of their ankles; she lets go of her masquerade, and becomes black again, while red pools on the sidewalk. Later, back home, speaking about Crystal in regard to the abuse she suffered at the hands of her mentally unstable boyfriend, Jo admits to the husband that she knew nothing, even though the woman was in her employment for the past eight years. Jo, played by Janet Jackson, who looks uncannily like her late brother whenever she's under duress, could very well be speaking about the \"King of Pop\" himself, since the incident can't help but evoke the Berlin episode where Michael suspended his baby Blanket aloft from a hotel balcony, with nothing separating the eleven-month-old infant from the ground. Incidentally, or perhaps not, Janet was eight years old when both Ntozake Shange's choreopoem \"For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow Is Enuf\" and the Norman Lear-created sitcom \"Good Times\" impressed themselves upon the American consciousness, back in 1974. Not for nothing did the filmmaker cast Jackson as Jo, which just happens to be one-half of Janet's middle name(Damita Jo), because in a filmic sense, it's good times all over again; it's as if Penny Gordon, the young girl that Willona(Janet DuBois), the Evans family's neighbor, rescued from an abusive parent and eventually adopted, has returned home to the inner-city, and remembered what it was like being a colored. In real life, while Janet was playing the victim of a violent mother on the teevee, Damita Jo's father, by all accounts, would administer corporal punishment upon her older siblings, especially Michael, and maybe her, too(according to older sis LaToya). When Jo talks about Crystal, it's not hard to make the leap and say that she's actually talking in her own voice about Michael, who proclaimed in his last great song, 1991's \"Black or White\", that he wasn't  \"going to spend the rest of his life being a color,\" but probably did, down deep inside, contrary to his white appearance. This, of course, is pure speculation, but when Janet first saw news footage of her brother behaving badly in Germany, it might have dawned on her, the exactitude of the toll that child abuse took on Michael. Although not to the extent of her late brother, Janet, by her participation in \"For Colored Girls\", practically outs Joe Jackson as a child abuser, since all of the women, in some shape or form, were done wrong by a man, like Tangie(Thandie Newton), a promiscuous woman who could be a character from one of Damita Jo's hyper-sexual songs. When the women congregate for a group hug at the film's end, it's quite possible that Janet needs one for real. In many, if not all of her scenes, you want to close your eyes, because the youngest Jackson practically channels her dead brother, the loneliest man on the planet.",

Though there are two major missteps (Whoopi Goldberg and Thandie Newton), almost everyone in the cast is just lovely. However, the film itself is just a jumbled mess of awkward insertions of poetry and monologues that just doesn't work.

He over did it. I  am not being insensitive to the abuse that Tyler suffered or these characters but as a survivor myself who has survived a tremendous amount of abuse, this movie was horrible.

I realize that he is trying to be inspirational but it is overkill.  I know these issues are still prevalent but we need a break.  If this is all that Tyler can write about then I believe ha he has done is best work in other movies and it is time for him to retire and explore alternative career paths.

I have had the opportunity to sit and to read a few of the bad reviews. I find that some of the critics are a bit short-sighted. There are those who would make this out to be a \"Tyler Perry\" blunder. There was even an implication that it brought all of \"Tyler Perry's baggage\" to it. This movie was inspiring, fresh, creative and moving. I happen to feel that it was a departure from the norm with Tyler and they way the script weaved each of the women's lives together flowed effortlessly. It was not choppy and each of the scenes seemed to appropriately compliment each other. This was a black man's \"Macbeth\".  At its core it was \"Shakespearean\" and I feel that it was a riveting, display of showmanship. Forget the 22 year old immature rantings and the implications that Tyler has once again created a movie where actors and actresses \"over-act\". This was a fantastic learning experience for me as a man and it brought class to the Silver screen in a subtle way. I give Mr. Tyler Perry and the entire cast of \"For Colored Girls\" a thumbs up!

I do think that he understood the power that the original play had and the depth of its meaning to the black community. he took an AMAZING play \"for colored girls who have considered suicide when the rainbow is not enuf\" and he transformed it into a powerful, moving, gripping dramatic movie that was supposed to incite rage and concern and momentum within WOMEN of all races and colors. the purpose so plainly laid out was to spark that fire within women to say it doesnt matter if i meet a million abusive, lying, murderous, cheating, down low, rapist; i am a powerful being and i am worth more than the scrap thrown at me and the treasures within could never be stolen. To everyone who only took away from this movie that it was overdramatic and manbashing u need to go talk to your grandmother or your mother or the woman down the block and around the corner who all have their own dramatic tale that is probably infused some man bashing.

All of us knows one of these characters up close and personal. Some of us are these characters. For Mr. Perry to bring this wonderful piece of art to film is admirable by itself. To point out what could have been done better is fair, but don't neglect what was done well. The hearts and souls of these women were exposed to remind us of ourselves, of the struggles of friends and family. To remember not to forget that we are so much more alike than we are different. The film causes me not to forget who I came from: strong women who endured and was still left standing; who I am: a off-spring of triumph over tragedy; who you are: human - just like me. Sure it was difficult to take Ms. Shange's work and adapt it into a story that interconnected and made sense. He did that; not perfect, but well done. Could it have been better? Everything can always be better. The real question is, \"does it speak to the people? Move them? Make them think, remember, leave the theater believing in themselves, in others?  I believe it does.

      "text": "First let me say I'm a black 25 y/o male and I think Tyler Perry is hit or miss. The best work I've seen from him is The Family That Preys and his Madea movies being stereotypical crap. So with that said I like this movie. The best are the performances with a special nod to Phylicia Rashad and Thandie Newton. Another great thing was the story or stories were well paced and nothing was to preachy though a few small elements were a little trite. Namely the problems with the lady in red. Though not bad just didn't feel as strong or important. The downside is Tyler Perry does not balance well with his movies and they always seem so one-sided. The men in this movie aren't bashed so much as they are givin no character. They are merely statues used as a jump-off point for the female characters. Now the play is older than me and I understand there were no male characters. But I feel that as a film, if they are going to be there, they should be givin more to work with. This is still a good overall movie that works with was is being presented.",

      "text": "This is one of the better Tyler Perry dramas I've ever seen. There was a lot of poetry, a lot of love/hate moments, and a scene that was too gruesome to show where a black man dropped the kids to the window. It was disturbing and hard to watch. But it was one of my favorite films from Tyler Perry. I like the entire cast, the script was intact, the suspense just kills me every time something violent is going to happen. I didn't get it on Blu-Ray, but I'll get it this week.",
