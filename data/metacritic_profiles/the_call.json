Halle Berry makes this movie exceptionally convincing and delivers an emotional punch. I will warn you if you are suffering from anxiety you need not watch \"The Call.\" So many times I shifted forward in my seat in suspense, while biting my nails. Now with all of the positives this film does shove a few pins through my heart. 3/4 of the movie excels as a thriller, but in a blink of an eye were running upstairs when we should be running out the front door. The thriller quickly turns into a horror film and this is where the film loses me. We are given a \"Saw\" ending?! As the director, Brad Anderson had everything going for him, but gives up on the ending and it is extremely disheartening. In a nut shell \"The Call\" is a fun, outlandish, and suspenseful treat that is worthy of a matinee ticket.",

      "text": "Despite a haircut that makes it look like some kind of small animal died on her head, Halle Berry is excellent in The Call, a tense thriller that was a genuine surprise, a smartly written and performed film. When Jordan (Berry) is responsible for the death of a young girl, she quits work as an emergency call operator but when another girl, Casey (Abigail Breslin) is taken she finds herself back in the chair trying to save her from her captor. The Call is a pulse pounding film as it playfully subverts horror conventions to create a thriller so tense that you may well feel your heart beating in your chest. Grounded by an excellent performance by Berry as the good natured but self conscious Jordan, everything in the film feels real adding a new level to the action as Breslin's Casey gets closer to her destination and her expected demise. The usual diversions are to be expected and an odd and slightly pointless cameo by Michael Imperioli slows the film down but all in all its a film with an interesting premise, two great central performances and an ability to play with the viewers head. The only real downside is the film's villain, he lacks the charisma of other horror villains and while the tension and terror is real, the ending is written on the walls from the beginning and it takes the adventure out of an otherwise great film. It's not a bad film, it's fun, clever and creepy but it doesn't really push boundaries in its conclusion so much as nudge them, hoping they will fall over on their own.",

The plot is very interesting and well developed and the acting is absolutely incredible. Abigail Breslin deserves an Oscar nomination for how believable she is in this film. The back and forth between her and Halle Berry's characters immerse you completely into the movie and have you on the edge of your seat. The supporting cast of Morris Chestnut, Michael Eklund, and even cameo appearances by Michael Imperioli and others don't disappoint either but this is hands down the Berry and Breslin show. But as I said, the flaw was in the last ten minutes because up until that point, we were looking at a solid 9/10 caliber film. Those last ten minutes caused the film to go from a nail-biting thriller surrounding unfortunately realistic circumstances to yet another cliched film where drama and suspense is built upon stupidity and unrealistic actions and reactions. Some people might not care much but to me, that killed the immersion and the movie-watching experience and definitely took the movie down a few notches. The fact that there was essentially no closure just added to the last several minutes being weak. Nonetheless, this was actually a pretty good movie but it had \"great\" potential.",

      "text": "When it was announced that WWE was staring a film company, like most, I thought it was a joke. After some success with films like the Marine and 12 Rounds, the company earned some legitimacy and with it comes bigger talent and better Directors. The Call is the first WWE film that doesn't star a wrestler, and it was every bit as good as any Hollywood thriller that was released last year. Halle Berry stars as a 911 operator, whose worse nightmare is realized, when a kidnapping victim calls in from the trunk of a serial killers car. From there, the Call becomes 90 minutes of pure, non-stop intensity. It's hard to imagine a film that features a girl in a trunk and a woman in a call center, being as entertaining as it was, but that's where the experienced Hollywood talent comes into play. Halle Berry is not someone I consider to be a terrific actress, but she surprised me, by playing a character who had to overcome emotion and think on her feet. It quickly becomes evident that going by the book will lead to this girls death, and the operator comes up with some pretty novel ideas about how to deal with the situation. The supporting cast, which does feature an active WWE superstar, is also very good in assisting with the statewide manhunt. This film was really on pace to be one of my favorite films of the year until the ending. It was very strange, but the film gets to a certain point and then just ends. There may not have been much more of the story to tell, but the way it ended made me feel like I left the theater a few minutes early to answer an important phone call or something. It maybe a small thing to some, but to me, it really took a lot away from an otherwise terrific film. The Call is not that original, outside of the particular situation, it's a type of film you've seen many times over. It is however intense, fast paced, very entertaining, and most definitely worth the price of admission.",

This movie, at least for me, its worth 7 or 8, but the ending, the useless, nonsense ending, almost destroys all the work and, lets call \"progress\", that was built before it. Why didn't they just finished the traditional way where they escape and call for help? I don't know; but sometimes you just have accept it the way it is: sh*t happens.",

This is as brain-dead as a movie can be and it assumes the audience will have the I.Q. of a rutabaga.

Granted, I wasn't expecting a high-caliber art film (although, once upon a time, Brad Anderson was an indie director - The Machinist, anyone?) but the WWE isn't exactly known for gripping storylines and well-developed characters.
