      "text": "The Contortionist Formerly Known as The Rock, the former WWF wrestler-turned-actor Dwayne Johnson, hasn't starred in a violent actioneer such as \"Faster\" since \"Walking Tall\", the 2004 remake of the 1973 Phil Karson-directed original, choosing instead to appear in star vehicles calculated to soften his image as a bad-ass. And even then, Johnson stayed away from guns; his character, Chris Vaughn, a former U.S. soldier, carried around a 4 X 4 slab of wood to settle his conflicts. The plan worked; he's not Jean-Claude Van Damme, who(like Johnson) started off in the athletic arena(kickboxing), but soon experienced a wane in popularity, partly because he couldn't act, even though that never stopped an Austrian-born bodybuilder from superstardom and the governorship of California. Both Johnson and Arnold Schwarzenegger were smart enough to ham it up, deconstructing their machismo by emasculating themselves in kid-friendly projects such as \"The Game Plan\" and \"Kindergarten Cop\", while Van Damme and Steven Segall kept making the same mirthless movie over and over again, ad nauseam. While neither man are particularly gifted as comic actors, in which the laughter they generate largely stems from the incongruity between their body type and feminine actions(for Ahh-nold, think \"Twins\"), they have enough charisma to make you THINK they're funny. Actually, that's no small feat. Remember Vin Diesel in  \"The Pacifier\"? Would Van Damme, given the opportunity to star in a game-changing film like \"The Tooth Fairy\", add or detract from the spectacle of being costumed in a pink tutu and tights? Probably detract, so give Johnson his due; he pulls off the tooth fairy get-up with only a minimal amount of creepiness. Now, after capturing the hearts and minds of children, and more importantly, their moms(even going so far as doing a cameo in Tyler Perry's \"Why Did I Get Married Too?\"), Johnson puts down the wand and picks up a gun and kills people for the first time in a long time. It's time to bring the men back into his fold. Playing an ex-con named Driver, The Contortionist Formerly Known as The Rock goes on a bloody rampage, killing the people responsible for murdering his brother after a successful robbery. Rest assured, the people he shoots in the forehead deserves their bloody comeuppance. Johnson isn't going to put his screen image at risk by killing the innocent, although it's open for debate as to who had it coming and who is worthy of a pardon. After all, ten years is a long time. People can change, not all people, mind you, like the second name on Driver's list, a rapist who preys on young women, a person in which nobody mourns when he ends up on the receiving end of some vigilante justice. It's the third and fourth names that prove to be more complicated. Echoing Quentin Tarantino's \"Kill Bill: Volume One\", the stripclub owner, the black man who pulled the trigger on the dead man in the urn, has a child, a college-aged son, just as \"Copperhead\"(Vivica A. Fox) had a child, a young daughter, in which some may argue, is enough reason for the assassin to ply some compassion. But being a parent isn't enough redemption for either Driver or \"The Bride\"(Uma Thurman) to call the whole thing off, and spare their respective targets' lives. The preacher, however, is given a reprieve. In a flashback, we see that the man of God tried to stop the slaying, therefore making Driver's decision to forgive and forget all the more easier. But what if the preacher was the trigger-man? That would be a real test of compassion on Driver's part. Providing the killer with a real dilemma might have put \"Faster\" over the top. If Driver offed the man of God, then moviegoers would really have something to talk about. Just because you're born again, and God has forgiven all your sins, does the man who stands over you with the power of God in his hands have to do so, likewise? For once, wouldn't it be nice to see something truly transgressive in a studio film? \"Faster\" is not \"Death Wish\", but for all the wrong reasons. As a hypothetical, \"The Bride\" would do a preacher, and that's because her creator thinks like an artist, not a marketer.",

Making up for his silence are the creatively named Cop and Killer who both explore relationships and contemplate the bookends of careers.

I did not include the Rock on this list because I think it would be intuitive for anyone to not kill the Rock's brother.  Just do not do it.  It is bad for business and it will not end well for anyone.  If you kill the Rock's brother, he will remember that and put your name on a list.  I started this movie with a preconception; it was going to suck.  It doesn't.  This action movie has some soul in it.  Its characters have back stories and they are presented in more than a single dimension.  Unfortunately, it plays a bit dumb at parts and feels like it must help its audience along.  Characters are introduced with a title such as \"Cop\" and \"Killer\".  I don't think these are needed, even for people who would choose to see this movie in the theater.  It's also not good enough to stay away from the cliches.  The cop is naturally 10 days away from retirement, the Rock cannot just turn around in a vehicle, he must squeal out of everywhere in at least a 270 degree turn of smoke, and the idiotic dialogue includes such gems as, \"I have a hunch,\" \"Well, so did Quasimodo and look where it got him.\"  The Rock in this movie reminds me a lot of Machete from last year.  If Machete 'don't text', then the Rock doesn't look both ways before he crosses the street; he just assumes cars will slam on the brakes and let him go.  He is on a mission.  He has one thing to do and he just goes out and does it.  Bravo on the initiative.  He also has tattoos on his forearms that only underworld gangsters and body builders can recognize.  The casting sticks out.  Tom Berenger shows up very briefly; is he mad because he didn't get included in the fourth iteration of the Sniper series?  Mike Epps shows up as well.  The script is good, but do you really need to cast the minor characters as well known as these guys?  It's a distraction (remember Ted Danson in Saving Private Ryan).  Also, a good, but unorthodox, inclusion is the 'Killer'.  This is guy is Johnny Cage with a serious inferiority complex and says quips like, \"I'm done with yoga, I beat it.\"  The ringtone on his contract killer cellphone is the theme song from The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.  That is not the only Clint Eastwood rip-off.  Remember the end of A Fistfull of Dollars?  *smacks forehead*",

We have Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson in a role that most suits him, he has definitely showed diversity, sometimes perhaps too much, but there is just something different with this character, he plays a convict who we simply know as \"Driver\" a broken and quiet man on a mission as soon as he gets released, he paces frantically from the prison where he climbs into an empty car waiting for him, he climbs in without a word and speeds off to an office space, where he shoots a man in the head and leaves, it's as simple but as brutal as that, he is a one man wrecking crew, but with good reason it seems. He is on a path to kill those who killed his brother in the most brutal of circumstances, and on his tail is \"Cop\" played by Billy Bob Thornton, this cop is close to retirement, but has a drug problem and a broken down marriage with a son involved, but is more involved than first glances would suggest. Also along the way is a hired \"Killer\" (Oliver Jackson-Cohen) who is an impressive specimen and a man who has done it all, consistently looking for challenges to save himself from boredom, he has a past that we learn through pictures he gazes at, a past that he may be trying his best to forget. He finds happiness with his girlfriend Lily (Maggie Grace) who questions his job choices but is ultimately committed to him. While Faster offers up some interesting characters, it isn't developed enough for it to properly stretch out, it could have properly developed its backstory which could have benefited an often closed and passing explanation for this mans actions, it therefore becomes a simple shoot and run with a few moments that show quality filmmaking, but not consistent. The performances alone keeping the film moving at a raging pace, with The Rock showing depth to character and proving he isn't all black and white. The film throws up some interesting twists and unexpected developments, they make it a satisfying film to enjoy, but don't offer much in terms of thought or drama, it is an adrenaline and testosterone-fuelled rampage that is is perfect for sitting down to relax, with a few starring performances worth applauding.",

Like when Dwayne walks into a seemingly\"next victim's\" room and points \ufeffthe gun right in this old ladies face and threatens to shoot her only to later find out  that its his own mother!!! This may not be the twist to end all twist but it was clear that he was willing to kill anyone who stood in his way of revenge!! Which is \ufeffthe point of this movie people....REVENGE in all its senselessness..so if you want some sort of Shakespearean revenge story then look elsewhere because this movie is gritty and straight to \ufeffthe point...(like paying for a hooker lol) Take the first scene for example...after getting out of jail Dwayne is told not to get into trouble...picks up a badass ride...walks in a building....pulls out a hand cannon and kills a guys then leaves...all without saying two words!!! There's also a moment of sympathy \ufeffthe viewers are treated to when he visits his ex only to find out she aborted their child...then he(seemingly) kills \ufeffthe club guard...calls his son and tells him he killed him ONLY to hear he survived...goes to \ufeffthe hospital and finishes \ufeffthe job that would make Rambo himself proud!! Once again people..this is not kill bill...this is faster..its gritty and in your face action without kungfu or swords. Afterwards he finds another victim on his list and finds out he's now a pastor which provides us with a shred of \ufeffthe unexpected from Dwayne in this movie....mercy! Its easily the best part of \ufeffthe movie(save for all \ufeffthe juicy violence which I also enjoyed)as he isn't beyond sparing someone who may or may not deserved it depending on \ufeffthe one watching. He's also being hunted by an ego manic viewing life as a challenge but sees    the ultimate challenge in dwayne johnson as he admits he is a much better shot than he is and much quick at aiming and shooting and obsesses over seeing mr johnson dead.

My favorite revenge thriller is Payback with Mel Gibson, but Faster may be a close second. The Rock stars in a role that is absolutely perfect for him. The unnamed man was set-up for a crime his brother committed, a crime, that saw his partners turn on him and kill him. Now after nearly a decade in jail, The Rock is out and seeking revenge. With his size, intimidation, and weird eye brows, The Rock finds out who his brother was working with and goes on the hunt. Realizing this, the man who set everything up, hires a hit-man to stop him, and the chase is on. I do believe that wrestlers can be great action stars, but The Rock never really did anything for me until now. This cold, calculating man, out for revenge is by far better than any character he's ever played. If The Rock was alone in this film, it wouldn't have been as great as it was. He is paired with Billy Bob Thornton, playing a washed up, alcoholic cop, who is days away from retirement. He really doesn't need or want this case, but winds up stuck in the middle with some pretty funny moments. Thornton is one of those guys who is good in anything and always brings his unique and dry brand of humor to every role. The pairing of the two, in an intense, fast paced, story make this film an absolutely must see movie that shouldn't be missed.",
