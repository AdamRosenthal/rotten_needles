      "text": "Ad nauseum, in rom-com after rom-com, the man inevitably arrives at that moment when everything becomes crystal clear, in regard to the woman he loves yet carelessly let slip away. As a corrective measure to his mistake, the man saves the relationship by proving his love with the right words to the woman, who only moments ago, stood in resignation with her dashed hopes. Usually the woman is standing in an airport terminal. Usually the man gets there by some mode of frantic transport. Usually they seal the deal with a kiss. Reared on formulaic filmmaking, it's no wonder that Tom Hansen in \"500 Days of Summer\", continues to misread the ending of \"The Graduate\", his favorite film about true love which he shares with Summer Finn, as happy. Except for the people who understand that Benjamin Braddock and Elaine Robinson are not in love, nobody has ever said, \"Shut up, Katherine Ross, you stupid liar!\" Especially Summer, who can plainly see the ambivalence forthwith, grow among the young folks in the back of the bus, when only a moment ago, the part that Tom, after all these years, is still reeling from, shows Benjamin crashing Elaine's wedding, plaintively crying out her name while he rattles the big church window with his fists. In a flash, however, the emotional high of stealing the bride from the groom, peaks when young Ben traps the angry congregants by barricading the doors with a cross, the Christian icon he uses as a weapon against institutionalized love, waving it around like a bat. On the bus, the moviegoer waits for him to kiss the runaway bride, but he doesn't even touch Mrs. Robinson's daughter, let alone, hold her gaze for more than a heartbeat. Using selective memory, Tom tries to pigeonhole \"The Graduate\" with any other romantic comedy, most of which depict love as a byproduct emanating from the grand romantic gesture, usually in a public place with adoring onlookers. Summer, however, in that repertory house, doesn't miss a thing; she sees the film's authorial commentary, an in-film post-script, about the artifice of movie love, and breaks it off with Tom later over pancakes. At the diner, Summer compares themselves to Sid and Nancy, an apra pro allusion to the punk rock aesthetic of the Nichols film, in the sense that Benjamin and Elaine are nihilists for rebelling against convention. Don't blink, and you'll see how \"Friends with Benefits\", like the tagline for \"500 Days of Summer\" states, ultimately, \"is not a love story,\" as well, with its \"Graduate\"-esque coda, ergo a deconstruction of the romantic comedy in the last frame. Too conventional for the label \"meta-film\", the film has just enough subversiveness to trump its climactic scene at Grand Central Station, where Dylan tells Jamie, without a trace of irony, that he's in love with her, turning their lives into the very thing(a romantic comedy), they both had agreed was fictive; merely a Hollywood construct which damages people with its unrealistic idealism pertaining to relationships. In an earlier scene, Jamie convinces Dylan to scale the Hollywood sign, representational of the fact that the executive recruiter believes in celluloidal love, although at times the woman forsakes the faerie tale, like when she publicly rails against Katherine Heigl, the scapegoat of her romantic woes. Meanwhile, the art designer gets stuck up there and requires the services of a helicopter, analogous to the rescue being executed by the film's satirical form, whose self-awareness is supposed to set the movie apart from contemporaneous examples of the genre, such as \"The Ugly Truth\". But just because the film foregrounds the artificiality of the \"meet-cute\", it doesn't make the \"meet-cute\"(where Jamie chases an I.D. sign on the baggage carousel) go away. A trope is still a trope, even when it's filmically italicized. As a result, the film can hardly be called a satire, not with a touch so light that the skewering comes off less as a criticism of genre convention than a reason for optimism where life could imitate art. Luckily, although the two leads are far from being the next Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn(the referencing of Amazon.com alludes to \"Desk Set\", a 1957 film about computers which was dead wrong in predicting the relevancy of people), they're also equidistantly ahead of Heigl and \"Killers\" co-star Ashton Kutcher, as well. To it's credit, the film gets real in the final scene, where Dylan and Jaime, now, supposedly more than friends with benefits, suddenly look awkward and bored, as they share a booth in the cafe. They're the couple from \"The Graduate\", but with a crucial difference. Instead of extending the silence, they reach across the table and tear into each other, in essence, updating \"When Harry Met Sally\" by faking love instead of an orgasm. They're not meant for each other, as advertised, but unlike Benjamin and Elaine, it won't stop them from having sex.",

The first 45 minutes of the movie is a laugh riot, and it manages to capture some of the the raunchy vulgar comedy that the movie sets out to accomplish.  However, this is only the first half of the movie, the rest of the movie barely manages to keep its head above the water of cliches.  The second half of the film gives only a few quick chuckles, but in between them, the movie might actually put you asleep.

Here's what's good about it: Witty, sharp dialogue that's well delivered, great chemistry between the actors, good acting, engaging side characters and side plots. The actors and their characters are likable. The ride is enjoyable and has just enough seriousness to give the plot weight and make the characters not seem like vapid singletons living in a New York bubble. Also, the jokes are funny and often smart, without being snooty. The pacing is also good, although I'll be honest and say it loses some momentum towards the end. It's predictable enough, as all romantic comedies ultimately are (and isn't that why we see them?) so think of this movie as more about than the journey than the destination.",

When Harry Met Sally, Pretty Woman, etc. Down with Love is one of my all-time favorites too, but not exactly realistic, but still adorable.  Friends with Benefits fits the criteria better than I've seen in years.  In the Rom-Com genre, the film is near perfect.  The chemistry between JT and Kunis is flawless and believable.  The use of New York and Los Angeles were reflections of both their personalities and, thus, enhanced an understanding of the characters.

Interesting: JT is sans clothes in many scenes, while Mila remains modest (nary a nipple).  While there's nothing exceptional about this movie, it's an entertaining and enjoyable summer hit. NOTE: Stay thru the credits for outtakes from the movie-within-a-movie.",

She delivered a great comic performance and she looked gorgeous. Also, I liked the ending. It was ironic because everything that they were believing at the beginning, turn out to be the opposite. Well sure it was kinda predictable, but it worked for this movie. You will know what i'm talking about after seeing it. An other thing that was awesome in '' Friends with Benefits '' is the situations (when there talking, etc) between Dylan and Jamie, which I found less cliche than most of romantic comedies.

The trailers made Friends With Benefits seem like an all out laughfest but underneath the laughs lies quite a bit of drama which gives this film a much more depth and allows the characters to flourish. The plot is simple and straightforward. Dylan (Justin Timberlake) and Jamie (Mila Kunis) are singletons in the Big Apple and come to the decision to be friends who sleep together. (I.e Friends With Benefits) And ofcourse the film explores the effects this has on them both. The chemistry between Timberlake and Kunis is superb and ultimately one of the keys to how good the film is. The film also has great dialogue thats performed terrificly by the cast, and thats another area where the film excels the some of the side characters, Woody Harrelson in particular, are awesome and obviously the humour is very well done as the jokes will make you LOL! FWB is a decent length but its enjoyable throughout and provides some genuinly funny moments. Importantly though the serious side of the film shines through when needed and gives it enough all the way through and allow the characters to be likeable and not seem to be the stereotypical cliched couple in so many movies. The film does become predictable as it nears its conclusion, afterall it as a romantic-comedy and it does slightly lose some of the momentum but that doesn't prevent this from being another fine comedy from Mr Gluck in what is a fine follow up to Easy A and easily one of the best rom-com's of recent times. I haven't even mentioned the clincher; Mila Kunis, enough said!",

Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis both did well in their lead roles of this sexy romantic comedy. I predicted that the plot was going to be predictable (as most films of this genre are) and my predictions were correct.  They did throw a curve-ball.  A Hail Mary attempt at tugging at our heart strings just a tad more than most summer romance comedy's do.  This was done with Justin Timberlake's father in the film.  It seemed that they were really trying to get us on that one, and to some, maybe it will be successful.  The film has a good message, and a lot of charm that grows as the movie progresses.

The first thing to realise about Friends With Benefits is that although its story is incredibly similar to No Strings Attached, it couldn't be more different. The endless comparisons between the two were bound to happen and to an extent thats a good thing because it shows how much better Benefits is. Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis prove to be worthy leads as Timberlake has charm as well as natural talent while Kunis is a force to be reckoned with (If you forget Max Payne that is) who has some exceptional comic timing. The supporting characters help flesh out the characters through a well written script which allows for a nice pace while also giving some much needed back story which Strings failed to do. Richard Jenkins will always be the supporting actor with so much more to say (see Burn After Reading and Let Me In) but he film manages to make that work through his characters problems. The only real problem with Benefits is that its predictable but then again all romantic comedies are. The ending is rushed but manageable and the 3rd act takes longer than it really should but overall its a decent comedy with some extremely raunchy comedy that works in the films favour. Oh and Flashmobs are just stupid. You're better than that Friends With Benefits.",

The critics seem to be arguing about this movie: Is it original or cliched? Is Kunis refreshing or shrill? Is the banter charming or relentlessly over-the-top? I would say all of the above, because the movie has strong scenes and weak scenes. Kunis's character is sometimes the smart, glamorous career woman every woman presumably wants to be, and sometimes she's just neurotic and too focused on men, even while she vehemently denies that men are the most significant part of her life, and that if she doesn't find a serious mate soon, she's going to have a nervous breakdown. Of course, the rom-com formula is that she is charmingly perfect--her clothes, her hair, her job, and her brilliantly timed wit. (There is a continuity problem with Kunis's hair--most of the time her sleek ponytail falls halfway down her back, but in some scenes she has a small ponytail that barely reaches her neck.) Of course, the theme is platonic-friendship-with-sex, a contradiction in terms that confuses the two participants more than anyone else. Everyone else knows they're in love and they're deluding themselves; they think they are participating in a grand philosophical experiment that no one ever thought of before, which brings us to the inevitable conclusion that was unintended: in the end, both characters appear to be undereducated. No one reads books, but movies reign supreme and are to be counted as the major influence that shapes lives, careers, and minds. As intelligent as both characters are, it's mostly street smarts--material success is based on being young, beautiful, hip, energetic, verbal, gutsy, and with a physical athleticism that makes for some smooth moves. This also happens to be all the attributes necessary to be a Hollywood film star. So, although the characters played by Kunis and Timberlake are suave and attractive, they are also shallow. A weak attempt to portray Timberlake's suffering over his father's senility is a case of too little, too late. Ultimately, if the characters have to be rich, spoiled, and self-absorbed, the producers should at least make sure that the movie has a plot.",

      "text": "Mr Harrelson, Ms Clarkson & Mr Jenkins are the best part of the movie, because it doesn't feel like they are acting. Ms Kunis (Jamie) & Mr Timberlake (Dylan) fire off one liners & repartee like, well, they memorized their lines. Ms Kunis fares much better during the 2nd half of the film, the actual love story. The writing of Dylan's character is way overboard and not necessary. It's hard to believe he is so naive. Didn't he see \"When Harry Met Sally?\" Men don't have women friends, unless they're fibbing or gay. Ms Kunis kept me from the dreaded FFWD. To the reviewers who compare this to similar films or the director's previous work, hey, just write what you thought of this movie. Story, characters, etc. Mr Timberlake was excellent in The Social Network as was Ms Kunis in Black Swan and Easy A was terrific-so what? That has nothing to do with this film. I didn't cry, laughed once and a while, and was waiting for better. It would be refreshing to see a movie end where the couple goes their own way instead of tying it all up with a nice bow. Even though lacking chemistry and with some less than thrilling dialogue, it's still worth a look. Do 30'somethings really talk like this? Perhaps when we write a review we can give some demographic info. I don't care what the critics say, what about you same agers? You like it?",

Although cheesy and predictable, the cast for this movie brought it all the way home for me and left me smiling and satisfied with the \"happily ever after\" ending. There was no doubt that they were going to fall in love with each other and get together by the end of the movie - however just every little detail and every cute thing made it that much cuter and entertaining to watch.  Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis look really good together. HOWEVER; the trailer is slightly misleading - the trailer depicts a much more sexual side of the movie while the whole movie is sappy and cute. Overall, the cast had great chemistry and the acting was well done. I'm glad I watched it; it's totally worth the time!",

That said, what happens prior is largely enjoyable thanks to a strong script, energetic performances from the leads and fantastic chemistry between Timberlake and Kunis. Woody Harrelson turns up as a gay sports editor to some amusement. I did get a little frustrated at how flippant and **** the pair are in assuming that their friendship will be unaffected, especially when as a viewer you know what's around the corner, perhaps that's the whole rub of the film though I guess. The writers try unashamedly hard to pitch their characters as the coolest inner city hipsters, Jamie from N.Y. and Dylan from L.A, listening to Semisonic, with flash mob contacts and friends with street artists. As the pair make fun of romantic film stereotypes, the writers just about avoid falling into the traps they mock.",
