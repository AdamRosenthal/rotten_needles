I'm a guy so I do believe that it is more difficult for myself to get wrapped up into Mr. Grey's appeal in the movie, however, to me he was just boring, and too out of reach and unrealistic. In my opinion, Mr. Grey would have been better suited had he been more down to earth and realistic. I believe that most of the female's attraction for him was wrapped up in wealth and materialistic things rather than sexual pleasure. All in all, I was very disappointed in the film, so much that my girlfriend and I attempted watching this film together and she turned it off before I could.",

But having read that the film was supposed to be better, that a score of script doctors worked on improving the characters and the plot, and stupidly getting into the frenzy of how inappropriate it was supposed to be - I went to see it. Even with the lowest of expectations that you can possibly have I hardly managed to sit through all of it. It bored me to death. The main plot is a totally unrealistic, flat and uninspiring, it's worse than piece of fan fiction written by a seventeen year old. Since I don't know the original book, I must assume it's even worse, which makes me shiver with dread. I have no idea why this film is rated 18+ in the UK, and described as including strong sex scenes - it has rather innocent sex scenes - all three of them. I've seen much more hardcore stuff in lower rated films, this is just ridiculous to call this film erotic - it isn't. And don't get fooled - the only BDSM - related scenes are the toys inside the red room. That remain mostly unused.",

There were way too many plot holes for me, like what is Grey's Enterprises? Do they sell stocks? Do they secretly push drugs and cover themselves as an impressive building that's an entire city block? What? I still don't know, as a viewer and not a reader. From the standpoint of a film student, having techniques and all ingrained into my mind, I do give this movie a star on cinematography, because I did appreciate it. Some of the set lighting was curiously put, but it worked. I didn't like the acting. It was awkward. Not a spark of chemistry for me between Dorman and Johnson. There wasn't enough background for me either. This was really just a mess, and the sex made its money back. I didn't have much for this movie at all.

I have not seen Johnson's other work but while she is an attractive young woman I found Ana a complete bore. I had really high hopes for this character hoping that she would be a strong woman who enters BDSM to further strengthen herself. Instead she is weak and I am surprised she resisted signing the contract and I am surprised she left at the end because in every other part of the movie she seems to give in to Grey's whims even when she has said she does not want to.

This is only because of the last few books made into films have not done well review wise since Hunger Games. That being said, I give this film an okay on the like and dislike meter; the dislike comes from the lack of forethought on the writers behalf. They refused to use proper transitions when cutting scene to scene; so, when someone who has read the books will wonder how the characters reached a certain point. Ex- when christen invites Ana and Kate to take photos of him for Kate's article, the script writers went from hardware store to the room where the photos were being taken. This happens throughout the whole film along with speedy line reading from Jamie Dornan, who refused to slow down and allow the audience to connect with what he was saying. There was also a lack of use with the supporting characters, their scenes were either speed up and disorienting or obsolete. The movie did not need Mia because Kate's brother Ethan was not mentioned in the film, and their was no reason for Ana's mom to be in the film either because the audience never even saw \"Ms. Robinson\" who was briefly mentioned and used way too aggressively. Furthermore, the film is 2 hours long, and the writers/directors could have used them more consciously instead of taking lines form the book and calling it a day.",

For all the nay sayers out there, you can have your opinion, but this story is not about domestic abuse. It is far from it. 1. They both consent to the activities in the contract. 2. She wants to know the punishment to the fullest. 3. If she wanted to stop she could have used the safe words at anytime and she chose not too. The other to books explain a lot of this. I have read romantic novels and other erotica novels . Fifty shades is actually quite tame compared to others such as the series Tiffany Reiz that include Siren, The mistress, The prince, and etc. In these novels they do get marked and it is more explicit and it explains more of the BDSM world such as what collars represent and how most submissives turn to being dominants, etc.  If they explained the contract more in the movie with FSOG, you would have known that one of the hard conditions was not to mark or harm the skin in any way, no hot waxes, cutting or any of that. It dives deep into Grey and explains why he does what he does and why in general people go into the BDSM world. I don't feel abusive relationships are the same. For I have been in one and I would know. Individuals are controlling in both the difference is with BDSM you have a choice and can choose to stop, but  with the other it happens whether you want it to or not and it doesn't stop.",

That said, the movie was about as hokey as the book.  I went to the movie to try to understand the characters better, and their motivations still make no sense.  Even Grey, in the movie, basically tells us that that's just the way he is (with a possible transference from \"Mrs. Robinson\").  Ana I just don't get.  She is naive and curious, yes, but she just jumps full on into Grey's twisted world?!  And at the last second when he actually physically hurts her (at her request), she does a 180?  Obviously, they get back together (since there are 2 more books), so I assume we learn more about the characters,  but a story needs to be complete in a single volume.

Technically it is very well done, photography is great, the performances are excellent and very summary captures the essence of the main drafts of the novel .They wanted to see more pornography? No need to be so explicit, strong scenes were very well worked and nudes are more emotional and real .They lead us to fully identify with the characters. It was a very good movie and look forward to continue the saga",

Taking it for what it is, Fifty Shades is a very creative twist on the Twilight story. The movie, although a little rushed in parts, played out much like the book. Dakota Johnson filled her role with pizzazz. Jamie Dornan was pretty good. He fit the role physically, but I felt he could have done better. Jennifer Ehle and Marcia Gay were adorable at playing there respective mother roles. I wish there was a little more Mia and Ray. I did like how they put a little of Christian's background in there. It's definitely sexually charged. It is not a family movie. On that note, to those saying it is a relationship based on rape. Yes, there are moments where he gets a little violent but it was consensual and she had a safe word. When she said 'no', that was it, end of story. The 'nice to know you' and 'another cosmo' scenes were my favorite. I don't know if there are any plans to make the sequels, but I know from the responses in the theatre, it would make a lot of non-readers happy to know that it isn't the end, it gets much better. More drama in store and both Christian and Ana have some growing to do. Overall, the movie was as I expected. No more.",

Christian never does things that Ana does not approve or says NO. Even at the end of the first book, when Ana leaves Christian, he wants to get into the elevator but Ana says NO and Christian does not move!!! In some points the movie is much more better than the book , because  the movie shows bold and brave Ana, and I like that Ana does not cry too much in the movie !!!!

      "text": "After falling in love with the Fifty Shades of Grey Trilogy, not to mention absolutely obsessed with Christian Grey and Anastasia Steel's relationship, when I heard there was a movie coming out, I had mixed feelings. E.J. James does not get enough credit for her work and like me and most other public readers of Fifty Shades, myself and others are often immediately judged. I will state that E.J. James revolutionized writing as well as giving the women an option to enjoy \"porn\" instead of watching the nasty, totally unrealistic scenes on our computers.  Therefore with all this in mind, I was excited for the movie, I watched interviews and the trailer about a billion times, I couldn't wait. Now, my boyfriend being the boyfriend he is he said, \"absolutely not\"  when I asked him to go see it on opening night with me, so I pushed it off until now. My person opinion is... This book is freaking hard to make into a movie and I give the directors, play writers etc... credit for giving it their best shot, but like myself and others, we all let our imaginations run wild while reading this book therefore this movie maybe appealed to someones imagination... but not mine and my roommates in particular. I thought this movie would appeal more to men than women, by this I mean I'm not trying to see boobs every other scene, but I do understand it is part of Christian Grey's \"fifty shades.\" But this is a female fantasy/ book therefore the movie should appeal to us women! Another point, this movie moved WAY too fast! I get it you need to fit a 500 page book into a two hour movie but holy cow did they miss the connection making between Christian and Ana! I don't want to harp on this movie because like I said, it is near to impossible to appeal to everyone's imaginations. My last point would be, if you read the books and enjoy a good movie, go to the movie anyways because Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan do a fantastic job on what will probably be the hardest role they will ever play. All in all, if you haven't read the books, read them. If you haven't seen the movie and have the opportunity, like me, to go to $5 movie night take the opportunity to go see it with your girlfriends and go home to your hubbies and see what fifty shades you can come up with!",

      "text": "This movie blows my mind. First of all, reading the book I could not pass the first chapter. English is not my native language but I went to college and I appreciate sophisticated vocabulary . I could not believe the poor language in the book. I thought a 12 years old have written it so I was not able to read it. The only reason why I went to the theater was that I loved both trailers and the soundtrack and of course all the talking attached to the movie. I went with my girlfriends because my bf totally refused to come with me. To du stride the movie had something magical attached to it. Till this day I can't say what it was because I know this production does not qualify fior an Oscar but there is totally something magical to it. I hardly ever watch the movie fit a second time but I can't wait till it's available on dvd. I want to mention that I was very upset that the movie was qualified as soft porn.  Whoever calls it that has no idea what they are talking about. Sex scenes are very tasteful and you don't get see too much of private parts in the movie. It has never been close to a any kind of porn. Also the sex scenes are very brief and not the major plot in the movie. I know for some parts the movie doesn't make sense and makes you wonder what's really going on but it's very aintriguing and pleasant to watch. The music is outstanding and complements the story very well. Overall if you are a romantic female you might love the movie as I do, but if you are a guy expecting sine action you might get really disappointed. Another thing, anyone saying this movie is promoting domestic abuse is out of their mind because everything in the movie is consensual and presented in a really fascinating way. My favorite movie in a while, thumbs up!",

I enjoyed the chemistry between her and the stone-cold Christian Grey, played by Jamie Dornan, and it was really the only reason I could sit through 2+ hrs. of this adult version of Twilight.  While the movie isn't that good at all, the relationship assessments were intriguing.  The realization that relationships require trust to be built and maintained, and that anyone can have a dark sexual fantasy or skeleton in their closet that is unknown to the world is always fascinating and very real.  Learning to release the shame and risk being vulnerable to another person scares the crap out of so many people in the world, but properly-placed trust offers incredible rewards, and I think that Christian Grey is on his way to learning that.  The problem I have with that is there's two more books to address that, and I'm curious how anyone can muster up enough on-screen time to make any audience feel like they should show up.  The first movie coasted on anticipation and controversy.  A second and third film wouldn't benefit from that luxury.  Perhaps Focus Features and the screen-adaptation can work to remedy any literary faults and find ways to charge the 50 Shades story with more interest, instead of relying solely on the sexual fantasies of women to find success.",

The film's R-rating pretty much meant that it would have to be tamed way down compared to the book. Sure enough, it was, and the final result isn't that great. The acting was far worse than I originally anticipated. Jamie Dornan needs to pick a better speech coach next time, because I could easily tell the guy's from Ireland since the accent kept slipping through the entire time he talked. Dakota Johnson didn't do much better, as I found myself laughing to myself and the way she delivered her lines and dialogue in some parts. Overall, in the end, all this film really was is a failed attempt to adapt an erotic novel into a film that can only get so erotic due to its R-rating. In addition to that, it's just another reminder of BDSM relationships (and this film completely glorifies it!)",

The plot/fantasy is basically right out of a high school girl's diary: a helicopter flying, piano playing, extremely attractive, 27-year-old billionaire picks you out of a crowd for no reason and obsesses over you. It's more over the top than most romance flicks, but that's to be expected.",

So as you can see, the following will be just a vision created by what can be extracted from the movie itself: I gave it a mixed score because I considered it that way, such as if you have 0.5 and want to approximate it and the result gets to be 1. The actors are good, just that; they show failures and tend to overact, but, due to the film characteristics, that's just the minimal necessity for it. Now, what's important: the movie itself. The proposal its interesting and the exposure given to the viewers its creative; you don't usually see BDSM practice in movies, and even more, to be \"socially\" accepted. But that's not the principal thematic about the movie, the problem is that it gets to show hypocrisy. We have this \"relationship\" between Anastasia and Christian where he wants her to fit his profile and she tries to adapt to it, but it never gets fulfilled; there is always some sort of resistance between both, and mostly coming from Steele (which I find actually pretty funny), where she always plays with him, due to the intention from his to be \"dominant over the submissive\" but her intention is not to give in easily; that's the biggest problem and inconvenient coming from the film. They sell the movie as the \"romantic story\" which is in the dreams of every teenager fan of the book: Christian Grey plays with Anastasia Steele in order to obtain pleasure and satisfaction, but as the end of the movie exposes, if you retire the satisfaction from the act, then this one becomes hollow*, such as the movie.",

There's no emotion, no passion, no life; like Christian Grey, it's all cold, calculated and mechanic. Want to watch a real steamy film about sex for grown-ups?

      "text": "Should have been made as an R rated film. This is a very good adaption of the novel, with beautiful cinematography and great performances from Johnson and Dornan, given that they manage to actually deliver the repugnant dialogue without breaking character or dissolving into peals of laughter. But don't misunderstand me, a good adaptaion of absolute tripe does not a good film make. The sex scenes really needed the addition of an R rating, and the score is artfully utilised to undermine the decidedly disturbed subtext here. However, on that, abusers don't tend to begin a relationship with the requirement of explicit consent, nor do they cease their behaviour when told no, nor do they prioritise female pleasure as part of their lexicon. I'd suggest that the ire caused here is the congitive dissonance of viewers finding the (inaccurate) BDSM depicted erotic, in spite of despising the clear dysfunction of the relationship and the lack of apparent power afforded the protagonist. I'd point out that in this aspect, this film is no different to the vast majority of 'romantic' tales, Tess of the D'Urberville's and Twilight included. Not as horrific as I was expecting, but then, non-existent expectations allow for small surprises. 4.26/10",

No character development whatsoever with lame attempts at adding backstory that at that point I just didn't care about.
