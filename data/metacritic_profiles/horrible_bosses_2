In fact, there were too many noticeable instances where jokes and gags from the first film were poorly recycled into this one. While the new story and writing was an overall disappointment, Jason Bateman, Charlie Day, and Jason Sudeikis, like in the first film, are able to make the most out of it and they themselves managed to make the film slightly worthwhile. It was good to see Jennifer Aniston, Kevin Spacey, and Jamie Foxx reprise their roles, but they didn't have enough screentime in my opinion. Christoph Waltz was ok. I also wish he had a little more screentime. Chris Pine does a pretty decent job as Waltz's crazed son. So while the story was a bit weak and lacking this time around, the actors all managed to make it a fun film for the most part. Overall, it isn't terrible, but it certainly doesn't hold a candle to the original.",

The involvement of Chris Pine was great, he was definitely a stand out and i kind of feel like they dropped the ball at the end because i would have liked to see him become a 4th member to the crew! BUT they fell into cliched movie twists and ruined that great possibility. Christoph Waltz honestly felt so wasted! His character could have been played by anyone else really. The return of the previous supporting characters worked, except for Kevin Spacey's who we'll talk about in a sec. **** Jones was great! and he was more involved in the plot than the previous film which i enjoyed! Julia's character was back because of boners lol but seriously she was good! They made her character get involved with Jason Batemans which i don't even think they encountered in first! Anyways both were great, now to Spacey! His cameo was more of a just because \"One liner jokes\" kind of thing. He added NOTHING to the film. I Mean i like Kevin and his character but it was pointless. Another thing that i didn't like was that they dumbed down the characters! Mostly Charlie Day's and Jason Sudeikis. The purposely made them MORE STUPID! Because having stupid people makes for more funny situations, i just felt that it was a step back for the characters! Overall yes there's some laughs and the story was different. It works, but the film could have been SO MUCH BETTER! I hope that the 3rd involves Kevin Spacey's character getting released from prison and trying to get revenge! idk but if they're planning on a 3rd just have a good PLOT! and don't make the characters even more stupid!

For most comedies, that's all I need...laughs. Though the movie could have been better, especially for the amount of actors in the movie...but it was still funny as hell. Though there were moments that weren't funny and long pauses of non existing laughter, it was still funny. Like I said, it did what I wanted it to do. Overall it's satisfying, if you turn your brain off. 7.3",
