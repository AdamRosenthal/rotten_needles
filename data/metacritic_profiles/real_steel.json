Not that I hated it but sometimes it was too much that certainly doesn't go with Fighting films but they did make it enjoyable . But Now I wish It could have been more mature , darker with more violence .

      "text": "How to make boxing can be accepted by young children? In thiz case, the answer is REAL STEEL. The Director Shawn Levy cleverly turns the rough boxing matches into fun, passionate and enjoyable family adventure by presenting attractive and super-cool Robot figures. Levy is well-known for CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN (2003) and NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM (2006). For me, he seems to know how to roll the dice of excitement. Besides being effective in constructing believable and powerful Robot-fights, thiz movie has heart-warming story of father and son relationship. Charlie Kenton (Hugh Jackman) is a former professional boxer who turns out to be Robot-fight promoter, just met his 11-year-old son he never knew before, Max (Dakota Goyo). Instead of Charlie teaches life lessons to his son, Max. On the contrary Max has been inspiring his father how to win World Robot Boxing, but more than that is about how to win life. There are some encouraging and gratifying scenes. One of them is when Max and his Robot, Atom show their dance moves. On the other side, I can almost say thiz is probably the most humane character that ever played by Hugh WOLVERINE Jackman. While the father character looks troubled and typical anti-hero, but it is relatively effective to gain sympathy. Spoiler Alert! The final scene reminds us of first ROCKY (1976) where the hero did not have to win the match, but he certainly won the heart of audience. Max shows his big heart by saying -It sounds pretty good to me. The Robot with the heart? Awesome!",

      "text": "I was pleasantly surprised at Real Steel. I was expecting a Rocky carbon copy at best, and another Transformers instalment at worst. Yes, it does owe a lot to earlier boxing movies, the Rocky series in particular, from which it \"borrows\" entire story arcs, but it still manages to present enough new ideas to leave its own mark. At its very heart, Real Steel is a very human story about an estranged father and son growing to love each other through a shared passion, and through shared struggles. The film also has exhilarating action, interesting visuals which blend the futuristic with the retro, and an unexpected amount of decent laughs. Hugh Jackman does what he does best - playing another gruff streetwise smart-ass hiding a kind heart, and Kevin Durand makes a good villain, a rich and brutal Deep South scumbag. Everyone in the cast is acted off the screen however by the young Dakota Goyo, who looks a bit like The Phantom Menace's Jake Lloyd but has bucket loads of attitude and considerably more talent. Despite the film getting so many fundamentals right, you have to ask what the character of Evangeline Lilly's boxing club owner Bailey brings to film beyond bubbling romantic implications with Jackman's Charlie, you have to ask why the film needs to be over two hours long, and you also have to ask why Real Steel needs fighting robots at all. My guess is that the decision was purely mercenary, as the story would have worked just as well as a contemporary tale about a damaged father-son relationship that is healed through their shared experience with boxing.  But hey, robots beating each other to rust is cool, and you really can't complain much when the resulting film is this fun.",

The moment that song started playing, I could feel a win coming on, the plot is fairly stereotypical, in what i'd like to think is a bizzare threesome child, the parents of which were Rambo, Robots and Big Daddy, but its genuinely touching and with the exception of the odd cliche here and there, not at all unbelievable. The acting is top notch, with every major actor playing their respective roles with true feeling and commitment that's rare to find in mainstream movies these days, particular props to Dakota Goyo, who plays Hugh Jackman's 11-year-old son, and of course props to Hugh Jackman himself, who delivers another brilliant problems, Aussie Power FTW. Add to the that the brilliantly choreographed and animated robot punch-ups and some real hardcore **** Yeah!) moments, and there's a movie well-worth seeing. One particular flaw was the average score, while the little ditties in the background did suit the different moods, nothing was particularly memorable, but this is more than compensated for by the brilliant soundtrack, featuring several well-known songs that when used are used very well ---Final Verdict: 7.5 (-Rounded to 8)",

Along the way he is joined by the son he abandoned 9 years earlier. He is joined by him because his mother has died so he takes him on the road, showing him the world of robot boxing. The problem with this unique premise is that it never really makes sense. The script sweeps under the rug some major plot points (The death of the son's mother is mentioned literally once) and is packed with clunky lines and exposition. The cast is sub par with the worst offender being either Evangeline Lilly as Charlie's love interest Bailey or Dakota Goyo as Charlie's son Max who is remarkably reminiscent of young Anakin Skywalker (yes, its that bad). Jackman coasts through the movie on charm despite the fact his character really is reprehensible at times. However the action in the film is visually flawless with some great animation and effects with the robot fights being great to watch. The main problem with the film is that the main story doesn't start for a whole hour (much like S.W.A.T) as Charlie makes mistake after mistake. I get that its trying to show what kind of a man Charlie is but its just slow and pointless and could have been done in half the time.",

Mais Real Steel est le divertissement attendu, attachant et dr\u00c3\u00b4le, avec en prime des acteurs charismatiques (le duo Hugh Jackman/Dakota Goyo fonctionne \u00c3\u00a0 merveille!), des combats servis avec punch et des effets sp\u00c3\u00a9ciaux bluffants.

The way this works is someone controls a 1,000 lb. or more robot with a what looks like an I-pad with joy-sticks. The opening scene is \"Charlie's\" robot going up against a very large..... bull. Yeah, a bull. Every thing seems to be going well, but that goes down the toilet when \"Charlie\" got a little too **** with his robot & takes his eyes off the bull. The rest is history, after losing that bet & match Charlie decides to run out on paying the opponent. Something that will cost him in the future, but not before running into two guys who break him the news that his \"ex\" girlfriend just passed away due to cancer. Well Charlie & her had a son together, a son he's never met. The following morning, Charlie goes to court to basically sign over his rights as a father over to his ex-girlfriend's oldest sister. Only problem was that it wasn't that simple, the sister & her new wealthy husband were gonna take a trip to Italy for the summer. Which means Charlie would have to take care of him for the summer. Charlie agrees to do so, with the condition of $100,000. I told you  he was a dead beat, remember? So he basically sells his son for 100K. 50 now, then 50 at the end of summer when the sister & her husband returns. In comes \"Max\" the son he never met, & let me tell you. This kid charmed the **** out of me! Charlie & Max have such a tremendous chemistry together, that is over whelming at times. Back to the set up. Charlie takes that money & buys a robot named \"Noisy Boy\". This robot is Japanese & looks like the \"Shredder\" with Japanese symbols all over. He was a bad ass looking bot. Only Charlie being money hungry puts \"Noisy Boy\" in a underground main event fight, right away. The fight is pretty awesome, the special effects are very well done. So is the choreography. Of course \"Noisy Boy\" gets his ass torn apart, literally. So Charlie is right back where he started no money, & no bot. He & Max break into this junk yard for robots. There Max finds a \"Sparring\" bot named \"Atom\". A sparring bot is a robot that \"fighting\" robots beat on during practice, but \"Atom\" was different. That is what I'll leave you with. The film was very well made, the fights, the characters & most of all the robots were awesome. You will be cheering from your seat, I guarantee it. This film reminds me so much of the original \"Rocky\". About a fighter who fought against all odds with nothing but heart. I recommend this film to the entire family. \"Atom\" will have you swinging your arms like a boxer & cheering till the credits come on.",

Worse still, it thinks its sly with these situations, which makes it seem a little shameless. It' not a bad movie, but its not the great movie it thinks it is.",

It is in line with great classics like Rocky, definitely a movie that you will want to watch over and over. I do not know what is wrong with the people who give it a low remark, i think they are insane or just plain dumb. The kids 10 years old, give him a break!! And bad acting, bad music, bad storyline?! What the **** is wrong with all of you?!

I don't have a problem with the father/son story, but remote controlled robots as a big time event is too silly for me. Perhaps if they had gone a little closer to reality and featured a father/son robot story based on what has already been done in robot fighting, i.e. Battle Bots, and kept it small time I would have accepted it. But I really needed the kid's bot to turn out to be another Sonny, from I, Robot; or B1-66ER of The Matrix; or Andrew of Bicentennial Man; and to give that line of the story a lot of face time. At the end it seems clear that Atom, the robot, was indeed working autonomously but it comes too little too late. (Also, it's not super clear weather or not this is a robot with a human soul, or 'Ghost', or simply a learning computer AI being slightly evolved...).",
