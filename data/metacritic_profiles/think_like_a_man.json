But unlike most romcoms it is funny. This is 'horrible bosses' funny.  It is also gratifying to see some talented actors get exposure.  Michael Ealy is a very versatile actor, and has the ability to make you believe that he is not acting, that this is real life.  And of course, there is the beautiful and talented Gabrielle Union. If our society, including our movie industry wasn't so 'segregated' Gabrielle would be a household name. And finally there is perhaps the most stunning actress in Hollywood: yes that is right: Megan Good! Never heard of Megan? Then go see this movie. If your socks are not wet from drool, then you either have no socks, or no pulse.  I only give this movie a 9 because some of the relationship resolutions were a little contrived.

The film  lacks economy of characters, having unnecessary, anonymous, redundant characters with nothing to do.  Like so many self-help books, \"Think Like a Man\" offers superficial insights of no real help, glossing over its ideas rather than exploring them.  The movie is shameless in plugging the book the film is based on, as the characters chant, \"Steve Harvey says..\" when Steve Harvey doesn't have anything meaningful to say about love and relationships--and neither does this movie.

The story is simple, in some moments is funny, any new. Think Like a Man is to hang. No more.",

When watching, by a quarter of the way through the movie you'll sit back and just watch because you'll feel like you've seen it before.  It's almost like a remake of Deliver Us from Eva.",

Think Like a Man is based on Steve Harvey's #1 New York Times Best Seller Book \"Act Like a Lady, Think Like a Man: What men really think about love relationships, intimacy and commitment.\" There were so many hot black actors/actresses as well as gorgeous clothing, fast cars and funny punch lines. This movie is the entire package and a must see if you are either in or out of any relationship. Read a bit more about this movie at chique-critique.blogspot.com",
