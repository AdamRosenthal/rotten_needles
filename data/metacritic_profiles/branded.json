The cast is great, the acting is great, the special effects are used perfect for the movie and the story explains how society is manipulated by crooked corporations and politicians. Branded is not going to be liked by people that are delusional about serious topics. Branded is what I would call an adventure critique. Good movies that go with Branded are Dreams From My Real Father,  America: Freedom to Fascism, The Matrix, They Live, Death By China and any of the Alex Jones Documentaries.",
