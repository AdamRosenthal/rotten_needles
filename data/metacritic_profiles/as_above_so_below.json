Even Under the Skin (one of my favorites of this year) a nearly silent film left subtle visual hints at what was going on. This has nothing!

Further, the guy from Mad Men brings some acting skill to the proceedings. It's a nice set-up, and an interesting final minute, but the final third as a whole gets fairly pedestrian for the genre.  I'd still recommend this to people, like me, who have been in the Parisian Catacombs and may have been a little freaked out by them.",

Do you want to make a film but can\u2019t be arsed? Then make a shaky-cam film as there is little or no skill required to produce an hour and a half of headache inducing wobbly action. Starting in Iran before moving to the catacombs of Paris the camera work is so frenetic that I couldn\u2019t make out what the hell I was looking at most of the time it certainly didn\u2019t deliver on the promise of the great setting as this could have been any old cave by the time they finally get round to going there, and that\u2019s the films main problem it\u2019s just dull and drawn out. I\u2019ve been to the catacombs (one of the reasons I went to see this film) and it is a quite scary place, the person I was with had a panic attack and yet none of this comes across in the film and this is before it spirals down into a mess of supernatural mumbo jumbo which just makes the last portion of the movie laughable. Plucky brit Lara wannabe Scarlett leads her team in to the caves like a poor man\u2019s Descent, two of her party are clearly only there to be killed off and may as well of worn a red Star Trek top each from the outset. Once inside they quest for a magic stone that has the ability to heal you if you get hurt therefore removing any suspense that might have been left in this vacuous borefest. All it took to make this film is any old cave, a group of models and a handful of Go-Pros and a way of reducing the majesty and history of the Paris catacombs into nothing more than a gimmicky footnote to get people in to the cinema.",

The movie is actually one of the better unofficial \"found footage\" genre movies, sadly. The beginning has it's flaws, but the pace and story of the stone is actually pretty well done. There's this stone called \"Philosophers Stone\" (KIND of a copy of Harry Potter) that is suppose to basically heal and give the owner internal life....basically harry potter. Scarlet finds out that the stone is in Paris and they go after it. Well this is where things are actually pretty good. Creepy things happen in the Catacombs. The good thing about this movie is the one fact that plague a lot of found footage movies \"why are you still filming\". They move the camera onto a head light, like a go camera. So \"still filming\" doesn't go through the audience's minds...well that's a small good thing about the movie. After half way through the movie, the story of the stone is quite stupid and turns into a backwards and confusing premise....that's really awkwardly pretentious. Its nothing to watch in theaters....just watch it on Netflix when it arrive there in the future...just don't stay for the ending. Overall I didn't thing it was god awful, but the movie is too confusing and pretentious for its own good. 5.8",

Did i mention that it is one better then Paranormal Activity movies.   Shaky cam thats what that i hate about horror documentary's but is writers  John Erick Dowdle and Drew Dowdle trying to make this movie like their previous horror suspense , toxic pool \" Quarantine\"  ? yes the shaky cam indeed the story much different.",

      "text": "A tablet written in Aramaic happens to rhyme in English when translated... yea, not a lot of brains went into this movie but for a lost footage horror film it is still one of the better ones which does say much since I have yet to see one that I like. The acting was terrible, and the banter was uninteresting and mostly distracting, but some of the horror ideas were not too bad. Sure they implemented a few jump scares and other cliches but once the movie gets going you cant help but cheer for the cave to kill everyone... not I am not kidding. You actually want them all to die because they are beyond stupid but the upside is you start to think of the cave as being alive in its own right. That is what makes it interesting. Most haunted house type movies do a pathetic job of making ghosts or monsters come alive but this one does it inadvertently.",

It goes so slow in the beginning I'm suprised i didn't die of old age. the back stories of all of the characters are cheesy (get it? Cuz' they're from france? Heh? HahahaHAHAHAH where's my cyanide!?)  and the scaryness of it all? not there, kinda almost creepy-ish is the closest it comes, and most characters were bland and boring (save papillion and souxie) and as sone as they die, so does the movie. They were the dim almost kindling light that kept the deep catacombs slightly entertaining and creepy. It was a terrible goody goody happy ending and all of the wrong characters died and survived. the only reason im giving it a 6 and not a 3 is because i have a strange affection to it. despite its many many many (x Infinity) flaws.",
