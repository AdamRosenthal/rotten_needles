Andy Samberg's Jesse is a great subtle change from his scene-stealing on SNL, while this is to Rashida Jones (who co-writes this, as well as stars) what \"Bridesmaids\" was to Kristen Wiig. Jones gives an incredible performance showing incredible range. This is a good date movie, but an even better movie for the brokenhearted.",

The only real downside I had for this one was that the supporting characters don't have a large enough presence in the story but the film is touching, funny and Andy Samberg and Rashida Jones are incredible to watch and that easily makes up for any shortcomings the film has.",

The cinematography also good and they gave lots of scenes and they were all important. Many of love drama or comedy romantic movies, they gave us many scenes but none of them really matter, but this one movie, each of scenes gave me different issues.

The cast in excellent in this movie and I really did care about the two main characters played by Rashida Jones and Andy Samberg. The film is surprisingly emotional at points but can also be quite light hearted and funny as well. Rashida Jones is so great in this movie. I have loved her since Parks & Rec and I thought she was just so easy to latch on to and so easy to love that you just have to keep your eyes on her for the whole run time. This movie would be great for date night.",

      "text": "This movie has a lot of things going for it, like a stunning and talented cast and the beautiful backdrop of LA, but somehow the whole thing managed to fall flat.  The character of Celeste herself, who dominates the film first with her upbeat acceptance of her marital separation, and then with her downward spiral when she discovers the hard way that she isn't as over things as she thinks, is compelling and interesting in her struggle.  But the movie spends a lot of time acting out rom-com stereotypes but with a meta-wink so that we know they're too clever, which is wasted time and often unfunny--Elijah Wood is completely unbelievable and not at all entertaining when his character makes a conscious attempt to be the over-the-top stereotypical gay friend, and of course Rashida Jones has to give a slightly drunk maid-of-honour speech at her BFF's wedding.   There's also a weird but somehow not awful interlude where the adult Rashida Jones strikes up a friendship with the young pop star (played by Emma Roberts, who brings just the right amount of attitude and melodrama to the role) Jones' workplace has recently signed, in which Jones somehow finds clarity in the comfort and company of the younger woman--definitely an unexpected plot turn, and not very believable, but Roberts' was charming enough in the role that I didn't mind.  Still, the charm of the cast couldn't make up for the lack of direction in the story, which strayed into shapelessness.",
