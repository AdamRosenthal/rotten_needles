I genuinely believe that Disney did something right with their latest live-action film. While most people were probably expecting a sword-wielding action hero, I'm happy that Disney treated their most beloved character with the uttermost care and respect. The story of Cinderella is very personal to each person who has felt like the underdog, but managed to rise like a Phoenix from the ashes in the end. If Walt Disney were alive today, I'm sure he would be proud to see his most treasured little savior be retold to the new generation in a beautiful and charming way. Bravo!",

Cinderella quiet resolve is thrown out the window as the narrator talks the audience through her character and the villain loses her quiet intensity. The acting from Cate Blanchett and Helena Bottom Carter is good and the visuals are grand and impressive at times especially during the ball scene but the film does nothing to justify its exsistence or give me any reason to watch this verison when there is a perfectly good version.

Unless you are a little girl or a die-hard Disney fan save your money all you are doing is encouraging more lazy live action films that butcher classic timeless stories.

It's one of my favorite Disney movies, so I was a little apprehensive of seeing a live-action remake after seeing what they did to Maleficent. From someone who loves the original story so much, they did an excellent job updating it. The new Cinderella is a fresh and witty remake on a classic movie that doesn't try to make any subversive twists or attempt to be some fantasy action flick. The story itself is largely the same, although with a little more emphasis on the stepmother and stepsisters, which makes this movie a very traditional fairy tale while still adding a new layer to the story. There's a lot to like in the new Cinderella, especially if you know and love the original.",

It had all the key moments and elements from the 1950's animated classic and was revamped with some new additions to the story line (Not to drastic or off the original plot), just enough to make it exciting and unpredictable. I loved the addition of Prince Kits background and life and what he though of Cinderella as their romance progressed. Their first meeting was one of my favourite scenes, also the Ball. The costumes and sets were just spectacular, I want that blue ball gown! Helena Bonham Carter as the fairy godmother was also another perfect match made in movie heaven, what a talented and refreshing actress. She blossomed, as did Cate Blanchett as the Step Mother, so much emotion.
