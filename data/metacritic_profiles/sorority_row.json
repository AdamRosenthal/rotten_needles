Is Sorority Row worth watching in theaters? Maybe if with friends. The acting is mediocre, but what can we say, it is a B movie. Sorority Row delivers outdated ideas, and maybe ridiculous plot, although it is fun, it is predictable and a really B movie, you can see it through the acting, the not over all good twist, and the plot. It is a cool women horror movie, albeit predictable and average, it can be so bad it is fun/good.",

      "text": "Apparently people haven't realized why this genre even exists yet, and are comparing it to other films that aren't even the same thing. This is not a suspense flick, it's a campy slasher flick. It's not even intended to scare you. The entire point of movies like this is really, really simple: Have someone kill a bunch of teenagers for some reason, throw in some camp value, and sprinkle in some creativity in how everyone gets killed. That's the only thing that's needed. So, let's run it down: Teenagers getting killed for an actual reason, and actually makes a little sense why they would deserve to die? Check. Carrie Fisher as a fearless, badass woman firing a shotgun that somehow doesn't need reloading (she fires it ten times in succession without one reload)? Camp value, check. Creativity in kills? Well, they're nothing groundbreaking, but at least they've all got their own flavor as the girls are picked off one by one. The first one is the best, in my opinion, because the girl is offering someone sexual favors for drugs, and the killer kills the girl by jamming the beer bottle she's drinking down her throat while she's sipping it, and then breaking it so the glass destroys her esophagus. Not bad, I suppose. And a twist ending to boot that would be pretty hard to see coming, but is actually sensible. So where's the problem here? If you want a cool slasher flick, here you go. Watching Carrie Fisher chase a mass murderer through a house with a damned shotgun is worth the money alone.",

      "text": "This movie has enough frights & thrills to make you jump multiple times, but it's not just that that makes the movie for me. What makes this film different from all of the recent mediocre horror films is that it is very much character and dialogue driven. The characters become as compelling as the plot itself and you actually find yourself starting to care about these characters. The dialogue shoots back and forth between the characters and further builds up the suspense until the final revelation. The suspense is very well drawn-out - it doesn't reveal the killer too early and it doesn't make you impatient for the end. The resulting finale is a big bang and not disappointing at all. The acting was also a cut above the rest - I didn't cringe at the lame screams or badly-acted terrified facial expressions because there weren't any. Kudos to all the girls because they gave performances beyond what I expected would be given. This movie doesn't deserve any awards, because it doesn't want any. Thinking about this movie is useless; if you want a movie that makes you think then go catch Inglorious Basterds. This film is meant to entertain, and entertain it did. It's what most horror films today should be. This movie has set a standard which all subsequent horror films (especially teen horrors) should follow. Just let yourself be drawn in instead of attempting to guess who the killer is and ruining the experience for yourself. If you just go in with a blank mind and just leave all you doubts at the door you will enjoy it as it is and not blame it for being what it's not afterwards.",

As a film it's morally bereft, utterly shallow, dumb, predictable, badly acted and really quite boring to boot. It doesn't really work on any level, not as a horror, comedy or even as a distraction for randy teenagers (it would have to at least be a little bit sexy to satisfy the latter, and it just isn't). I honestly found myself chewing through my own hand in order to summon the willpower to make it through to the end of this dire movie. It's complete durge, and what's even worse is that the film's conclusion leaves open the possibility of something utterly terrifying - a sequel. The only redeeming feature of the whole thing is Carrie Fisher, who is stupendously entertaining when she is briefly on screen as the stern but maternal, shotgun-wielding sorority mother. Thank you Miss Fisher, you at least made your scenes bearable through sheer ballsiness.",

      "text": "he daughters of Bruce Willis and Greg Evigan team up in Sorority Row, a remake of the 1983 Horror classic, The House on Sorority Row. The remake is of course modernized and takes the classic independent horror film to the next level, with terrific effects, increased levels of fright and gore, and of course a ton of beautiful people. Where is this college and how soon can I apply?! Every guy and girl featured in the film, with the exception of Carrie Fisher, could be models, despite being well passed the age of most college students. The story starts out much like the original film does, with a Sorority prank that goes horribly wrong. The girls decide to cover up the incident and put it behind them, but at a large cost to their sisterhood. A year later, at the same party, someone knows what happened last year, and have decided to make the whole Sorority pay for their crimes. This film is a classic 'who done it' mashed together with a slasher film, and the results are pure excitement. The truth is that most of these film don't have much in the way of a story line and the killer is obvious to everyone, but not this time. This film is very reminiscent of Scream, and it really had me on the edge of my seat. A good Horror film is hard enough to find, but one with all that suspense and a compelling story to follow, that's worth it's weight in gold! Sorority Row is a perfect choice for those who want to spend Halloween, in front of the TV watching a scary movie!",

The death scenes were original and clever. Escpecially Chugs death with the bottle everyone I know thought that was clever. The weapon itself is to me better then Michael, Jason, Freddy, and all these other killers. Tricked out tire iron. Suspenful when It doesn't try but when it does like with the bathroom scene, it doesnt work. The killer killing people for no envolvement was dumb.
