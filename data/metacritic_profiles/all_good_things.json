But in \"All good things\" not every reasons are explained because the director is telling a real story(the names of the characters in the movie were changed)that is still a mystery and the leading actor of this drama is an enigma. David Marks(Ryan Gosling)son of a powerful real estate man(Frank Langella)tries to establish a perfect and peaceful life with his wife Kathie(Kirsten Dunst)by avoiding his duties in the family business(legal and illegal).But it won't be easy for him to resist at the pressure by his strong father and he will be forced to take part of the ominous projects of his persuasive father.Besides,his increasing psychological problems will destroy his life with his wife.The second part of the movie is a shocking and bizarre look at the last years of the disturbed man and the homicides of his two friends.And the movie becomes a sort of \"Psycho\". What we see is the results of murder investigations. I liked the mixture of themes such love,corruption,madness,mystery and murder and Andrew Jarecki did very well in showing the growth and reasons of the characters,although David remains an enigma in many of his actions.I really liked the details he offered and I was drawn from the beginning to the end.The movie is predictable in some parts but in the last one is a real unexpected turn.Ryan Gosling was great in playing a troubled man and I was moved by the portrayal of this poor soul that had no chance to live in peace with himself.Also he shows some sinister sign of madness that are really overwhelming. Kirsten Dunst was simply terrific in portraying a victim of the husband and his powerful family but also an ambitious woman who tried to get advantages by the the whole situation in terms of the prospect of a wealthy life.For her amazing acting she should have been nominated for an Oscar.Frank Langella was really good in the role of the cold and manipulative father.The three characters are really complex and not easily categorized.\"All good things\"is probably one of the most appealing and interesting movie of the year.It has real great and original moments and although it doesn't provide an easy solution to the case it is not a distracting thing in my opinion(since it's still an open case).",

I kept wanting more, and I couldn't help feel like the story, true or not, and its characters were too heavy for the director's hands. Jarecki did \"Capturing the Friedmans,\" which was more than just good, so I was slightly disappointed in some of his decisions. Luckily, Gosling and Dunst do impressive grunt work for him and land up saving the film from a straight-to-video death. Bottom line is \"All Good Things\" is one of those films that prove great actors need great directors to make great films (look no further than \"Blue Valentine\"). One without the other and you just get, well...good.",

Incredibly ambiguous (because it has to be), All Good Things is a captivating mystery and crime film that is a really compelling character study, as much as it is a compelling crime tale. Ryan Gosling and Kirsten Dunst are both phenomenal here and Gosling's cold, calculated performance most certainly feeds into the ambiguity of the film as a whole and the film benefits from it. The direction and pacing are solid, but my main drawback here is the flashback storytelling that comes and goes. I think it was an interesting approach, but I am mixed on how effective it truly was. That being said, All Good Things is not a great film, but it is a well made, well acted film that really gets your mind turning trying to figure out what really happened.",
