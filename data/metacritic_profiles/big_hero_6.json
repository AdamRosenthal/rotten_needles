The animation looks good, the characters are ok on their own, but the story... oh my god the story is horrible. Cliche after cliche and forced emotional situations. It was clearly following a formula rather than a story. Whoever wrote the story needs to be shot for how badly it progressed. I actually predicted the entire movie in the 1st 10 minutes (I didnt know anything about it going in) and the only thing I got wrong was who the villain would be. I figured that the movie seems to cheesy that it would try another predictable twist like making the elder brother the bad guy and he is doing to get his GF back. That is how predictable the movie was. No originality whatsoever and it got worse as it went along. I almost puked when i saw it turn to a bad superhero flick. My friends 5 year old asked us why the kid didnt just build more of the small robots or make a new remote control (referring to the brain control interface).... how sad is it that a 5 year old figured that out?

I wish i could make this up but the only God, totally predicted this would happen (among other predictions that came to pass) and recorded the last time this happened culturally... humanity became pretty evil and God in his mercy had to destroy it in a world-wide flood to save Noah and family and all future generations born into the then (and now) unforgiving and evil world. You are told of all the nice things technology gives us but nobody considers all the terrible things we will do with it. Holographic sex doll anyone? Or if your grandpa was Hitler and someone uploaded him into the internet maybe he gets downloaded into a nice robot. My concern here is not technology itself, I believe we're just wanting it so to cheat death and keep sinning, not being accountable to God but BEING God. The wages of sin is death, and through Christ Yeshua (Jesus) you can live. But mark not my word but God's Word; we're not going to be allowed to live forever with or without technology apart from Jesus. God said \"My Spirit will not contend with man forever\" Gensesis 6:3. I'm not judging you for watching or even enjoying the movies, I just don't want people to be deceived. Your probably thinking i'm totally deceived too. That's ok but please don't hate me!  Or say i'm being \"intolerance\" and then become totally intolerant of me. But when your kid begins to hate himself because he's not as good as all the superhero's he sees in every kids show or as big as the school bully, just tell him he'll get an upgrade one day. We don't need technology near as much as we need Jesus, our moral example and creator. Don't you think that he would know what would or wouldn't make us 'better'? Anyway, i'm not trying to convert anyone, I'm completely incapable of changing anyone's beliefs no matter how much I write here, that's a matter between you and God who says, \"I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit in you; I will remove from you your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh...\" Ezekial 36:26. I'm just saying we should seek truth for ourselves and not believe everything Disney or Microsoft or Nasa is telling us.",

The characters were always enjoyable and kept my interest, but it never lead to anything more than a mild fondness, so when I heard there would be a Big Hero 6 I can't say I was anything more than intrigued. The first Disney animated film to feature Marvel Comics characters since the acquisition in 2009, the characters seemed ripe for an animated romp onto the big screen, but detail changes to core characters left many fans holding their breath and hoping that the animation pioneers wouldn't turn their beloved characters into nothing more than second rate acts for their theme parks upon the films release. I am here to calm some of those fears and tell you that Big Hero 6 is a lot of fun!",

It is a little bit transformeric and Bayish-style by starting off with some familiar scenes in \"Real Steel\" and having electronic pop-rock style scores from the composer Henry Jackman. However, setting in a background of American-Japanese culture might lead to the thought of targeting Japan's market after enormous profit from there, but this adorable, kind-hearted, friendly robot Baymax reminds us of good moral values, and certainly, it will easily be one of the most loveable character among the audiences.",

Once again, this should have been under the Pixar label as not to ruin Walt's legacy.  Cashing in on their Marvel acquisition, The Walt Disney Company has attempted to make a kids movie which resembles every single other super hero movie out there.  Can you imagine if a classic like Aladdin just had 5 minute long action sequences strung together instead of jokes and songs? This one makes lesser known Disney films like The Black Cauldron and Atlantis look like a masterpiece akin to Bambi.",

Then comes the main event, an energetic and non-stop action adventure that follows a young man (Hiro) and his large, soft robot Baymax. They team up with a group of inventor nerds to form a super group that tackles a villain with a cool weapon. The pace is lively and the characters are interesting, but only one (voiced by T.J. Miller) provides any comedy. Most of that is left to Baymax's sweet size and lovable attitude. The visuals are bright, beautiful and dazzling, as Disney does best. Fun for kids and adults. NOTE: Stay thru the credits for one of the best cameo gags ever!",

Although there is a new thing in this movie, not an idea that breaks paradigms, but interesting as well: mourning and how to face it. We notice the reactions, the different paths to overcome it and the acceptance. All of this is achievable by the presence of a protagonist that allows to audience to identify with, a lovable/charismatic companion and a parade of eccentric friends.

The movie was funny in some parts, and Baymax is a pretty interesting and creative character. However, if Baymax didn't exist, this movie would be pretty bad. 2.5-3 stars bad. I'd say if you have kids, this wouldn't be THAT much torture to watch. It isn't a bad movie, but it isn't very good by Disney standards either.

Big Hero 6 is a great film that provides Marvel fans, Disney fans, and movie fans in general with a great experience rivaling that of a Pixar film. The supporting characters could use some development but with any luck this film will get a sequel that will explore them even more. Until then I will continue to watch this film as I eagerly await the next Disney film as this studio has regained the magic they had in the 90s. Hopefully Pixar can pick up the slack with Inside Out but regardless its glad to know there is animation studio on top of their game again! There is a short at the beginning of the film called Feast its not the best short ever made lacking the awe of Paperman but it is charming.

A generator of sympathy, meaning the bad guy is essentially non threatening at all. It's also a shame that genuinely quirky and interesting characters like Wasabi and Freddie didn't get a whole opportunity to explore their potential as much as they should've, giving warm and relieving addition to their futuristic suits. This being said, Big Hero 6 is solid to entertain, the chemistry between Baymax and Hiro is humble and charming and will please as a family movie. Just don't expect anything too meaningful, it often gets too caught up in sad moments that it forgets the environment it is set in isn't that harmful at all.",

I love the whole city, San Fransokyo, since it combines both San Francisco with Tokyo; it worked as a very cool environment for the film. The characters were a fun bunch, I especially liked Baymax, he was very funny and he is one of the biggest reasons why this film is excellent. The whole group of scientists, that befriend Hiro, is also a cool group of people. Some of them fall under a few cliches but they are still fun to be around (their whole \"lab\" room was also cool, I liked the inventions they were creating). The story is pretty cool even if it was a bit predictable at times; seriously, don't have your expectations too high for the movie's villain. Despite, some minor problems, this film has a great story, there are even some pretty emotional scenes in this film I must say. This film is great and probably one of Disney's best films in a while.

This mostly consisted of the sometimes cheesy dialogue made by characters, such as Gogo's \"Woman UP!\" during the final fight, or Wasabi's, well, overall dialogue period. I just don't really like Wasabi. Some plot twists were obvious, some plot tools were cheesy, such as when Hiro \"randomly\" decides he needs to upgrade everyone. I did like this a whole lot better than \"Frozen\", though. This movie got my emotions roiling in several spots, and laughing uncontrollably in others. I will say though, the scene where Hiro tells Baymax to destroy Callaghan, was one of the most powerful and shocking scenes in cartoon and possibly superhero movies in general for me. I watch this movie every night when I go to sleep, but I always stay up for that one part. But, besides some cheese, my biggest peeve was the ending. True, I didn't want Baymax to die, but when he did, I really felt that this was a fitting end to Big Hero 6. When it came down to it, that is what Baymax was built for: To Save Lives. So when it was revealed that he was brought back, I was kind of disappointed.",

It has an awesome story, memorable characters including Baymax who is hilarious and it had great musical score by Henry Jackman and one original song Immortals composed and performed by Fall Out Boy was very good. It had impressive animation, creativity and stunning visuals, they look better than Frozen and Wreck-It Ralph in my opinion. It had a lot of action, humour and emotion which is a perfect balance for a Disney film. My final score for Big Hero 6, 9.8/10. (Amazing)",

The characters make up for the amazing acting and the real emotions coming from them, the animation is so alive and so bright even when the picture is very dark. But the real reason that this film is the next big Disney masterpiece? It's the inspirational messages that the film presents, and in this film the message falls under the lines of vengeance does not become received by revenge, and learning to let go is a hard thing but to some people, it a natural instinct, and wherever you go, take some friends with you, because you could be something bigger and stronger when you have help, sure in the end some people don't make it but that right there is the message, staying strong in the face of challenges, that's what makes Big Hero 6 a masterpiece.",

Bone is not bad, the only thing I am against is that Disney continues to use the cliche to Kill the parents of the protagonist and the character you loved you so much, it's something that we have seen in many Disney movies and I still do not understand why still do, maybe is its a formula of making movies or maybe is a betrayal of the studio, do not know. If they wanted to kill as Tadashi do it but at least let their parents are alive, not make them disappear from the film and say they are dead without explaining how they died. I also found it absurd that the reason for why is Callaghan the bad guy and the Baymax sacrifice, i know many people cry but I'm sorry, I'm think it's really silly and absurd, but the film is really bad? no, it could have been better? probably yes. There are many things that they liked me the film, I like animation, the characters, the comedy, the action scenes, the city San Fransokyo, the tecnology, the friendly relationship of Hiro and Baymax and the message.

Than they have a professor Callaghan who is sought to be smart and cunning and shares a rivalry with his brother Krei they also meet Baymax later in the story when Hiro accidentally summons him and leads him on a journey these characters interact with each other in different ways some good some are bad others are falsely-accused  everything is going well until Hiro's brother Tadashi dies in an unexpected incident after a tech show cast. Than Hiro goes on the hunt for the suspect with his newly acquired friends they will fight many battles together and the movie does have some positive messages and is one of the most inspiring and greatest movies I have ever watched. The animation looks good to me and little details like the way Wasabi cuts a hole in a wall and they way the microbots move together in a scary fashion sure is bound to give to some dramatic as well as humorous situations that occur in the movie. The voice acting is so well done it feels like I am watching an actual conversation between unlikely or completely likely friends as well as they plot which made sense and gave way to an epic struggle of good vs evil. It is one of the best films I have ever watched and with the int resting lore and characters with their amazing gear created for their liking I am ready for a sequel as to me this series seems to good to be a one-hit wonder and I certainly hope it will stick to it's original comics.",

      "text": "The Disney film \u201cBig Hero 6\u201d was a huge hit in the box office. The beautifully made animation was the best of any animation seen so far. Spectators of the film wouldn\u2019t suspect a fourteen year old boy genius to get into college at such a young age; the boy had proved to show great intelligence throughout the movie. Many people fear the development of A.I. and this movie puts that thought into a different perspective. MIT\u2019s article on A.I. titled \u201cOur Fear of Artificial Intelligence\u201d reflects people\u2019s fear of A.I. which is the opposite of what \u201cBig Hero 6\u201d stands for. They say that \u201cA true A.I. might ruin the world- but that assumes that it is even possible\u201d (Ford). This article not only explores the dangers of A.I.,  but it also explores the benefits. One of the benefits could be that \u201cA benevolent superintelligence might analyze the human genetic code at great speed and unlock the secret to eternal youth. At the very least, it might know how to fix your back\u201d (Ford). This makes Big Hero a timely film due to the fact that it explores the capabilities of Artificial Intelligence at a much more innocent level, than what could happen if someone were to go too far with A.I. Overall our group does endorse the message Big Hero 6 brings up following the lines of Artificial Intelligence, however it still needs to be kept in mind that Artificial Intelligence is dangerous.",
