Throughout the film Luli is drawing in a sketch book as she narrates and I really liked the simplicity of the drawings. No, what let it down (IMO) was a poorly put together script. They say it\u2019s a bad idea to let the writer of a novel attempt the screenplay and I suspect this is a case in point. It probably works very well as a book, but it really didn\u2019t work on the screen in this form. I like the actors fine but I found little to like in the characters. Our main focus, Luli, has very few redeeming features; she was a victim of circumstance all the way through and I found it quite frustrating to watch I\u2019m afraid. Sadly not one I can recommend.",

The plot drags but again, the hopelessness of Moretz's situation and how the characters around her are affected and affect the course of actions that play out are enough.",

From the cinematography to the complexities of each character, to the witty dialogue, I found it to be very entertaining overall. I also enjoyed how it managed to be far fetched in a way that felt almost whimsical, but also sadly realistic (Luli's character wrestling with whether Eddie was a handsome, yet controlling cowboy or a obsessive and violent stalker felt particularly familiar). I think this movie did a good job of capturing the vulnerability of being a young girl from a broken home, struggling to decide what she wants she wants in life, how to get it, and who to trust. I wouldn't call it a perfect movie, but the acting was really stellar in my opinion, and I did enjoy it.",
