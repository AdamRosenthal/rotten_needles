There are relations to Pulp Fiction in this that made me laugh, and if you don't know what I'm talking about, uh, maybe you should've seen that before you saw this, dumb-ass. I don't mean the **** AMC version, I'm talking DVD, IFC, or anything else that's uncut. And not **** CBC, don't waste your time with the damn tracers. Still, this movie is a very good combination of action, drug- hunting, and all the humor you'd expect from such an actor like John Travolta, not the greaser, John, but pretty much any other John. The good thing about this cult, no **** ending like all the Scary Movies, or the Hottie and the Nottie. Go see From Paris w/ Love...",

If your looking for a movie that keep your attention for a movie night in, give this a movie a rent. Plus their is a little reference in this movie to one of John Travolta's most famous lines I thought was hilarious. Not the best action movie but definitely worth a watch.",

      "text": "Watching old-John Travolta was running, hopping, and climbing was very refreshing. It looks like he is trying to be Bourne. Thiz criminal-thriller was directed by Pierre Morel. The man is known as creditable Cinematographer, behind THE TRANSPORTER (2002), SOMETHING GOTTA GIVE (2003), and UNLEASHED (2005). In my point of view, Morel action scene is always excessive and hard to believe to happen in real situation, although is still entertaining. His directing credits are DISTRICT 13 (2004) and TAKEN (2008), which loved by most critics. Thiz side kick-action-adventure, Travolta accompanied by Jonathan Rhys Meyers, who once again showed his skill by speaking Chinese language fluently in one of the scenes. The script had some potential to develop to be more interesting and interspaces with some funny scenes. The story is about an US ambassador assistant (Rhys Meyers) tasked to escort a special agent (Travolta) in some mysterious mission. Later, this mission also involve with Rhys Meyers character fianc\u00c3\u00a9 (Kasia Smutniak). The surprise character on thiz movie spotlights on Smutniak who just made her Hollywood debut. In my notes, thiz movie had some weaknesses on story-telling, by spoiling too much on its surprising elements. I already had a feeling where thiz story would goes to, even on the early scenes. The elements were too obvious to notice, (Spoiler Alert!) Bcoz the character played by unknown artist and shared too much screen (even on the beginning scenes). In one of the scenes, when Smutniak character were waving goodbye to her fianc\u00c3\u00a9 (Rhys Meyers), where the scene is too underline and the duration is too long, I already known definitely she will be the bad guy. Or just simply, if you sensitive enough, you could already found out on the title itself! Visit My Blog on JONNY'S MOVEE : http://jonnyfendi.blogspot.com",

      "text": "I was thoroughly disappointed by From Paris with Love. Luc Besson's normally energetic and no-nonsense writing feels turgid, and director Pierre Morel has made films that are both more fun (District 13) and more consistent (Taken) than this sorry affair. Both leads are miscast - Johnathan Rhys Meyers' ambassador's assistant and part-time CIA operative James Reese quite remarkably manages to come across as both wooden and camp at the same time, and John Travolta's agent Charlie Wax is just an offensive, egotistic, fat old man who couldn't believably pull off half the stunts he does in this film (Travolta clearly has a good stunt man to do the tricky stuff, and the camera craftily cuts away whenever he's required to run). The plot is predictable, the representations of various ethnicities in Paris borderline offensive, and the action is unimaginative, and surprisingly infrequent for an action film. The only thing the film really does is raise the occasional smile with a few passable jokes (usually when Reese points out the ridiculousness of the situation, or when Travolta is particularly hammy) though even this is somewhat spoiled by a decision to crowbar in a reference to one of the lead actor's biggest hits. I'm sure said line was intended to be funny, but instead it just causes you to groan in deep embarrassment. From Paris with Love is only worth watching for the odd chuckle - it works on no other level, not as an action film, thriller, comment on terrorism and paranoia, not even as a buddy movie. It's merde, Monsieur Besson and Monsieur Morel, and you both need to have a long, hard think about where your careers are heading.",

      "text": "From Paris With Love plays as though it were the fourth or fifth sequel in a legendary saga, that has reached it's end and is just milking another film out of the story. It's adequate and somewhat entertaining, but nowhere near as good as it should have been. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers stars a a junior C.I.A. agent, working out of the U.S. Embassy in Paris. Until now he's been asked to do simple things. His role quickly changes once and international terror cell sets up shop in his backyard. Rhys-Meyers is quickly paired with a veteran C.I.A. hit-man. The kind of guy you call when you want things done quickly and under the radar, but years of killing has taken it's toll. The mysterious man has become cold and reckless to a fault. The story here is painfully predictable, in a film that is about half as long as it should have been. Yes, the film is basically non-stop action, but it moves in such a way that the story is rushed to the point of confusion. Jonathan Rhys-Meyers was terrific in an opposites attract kind of way. John Travolta on the other hand was much too old and out of shape to be believable as this crazy, over the top hit-man. The chemistry between the two and the amazing non-stop action make this movie a pretty entertaining one, but the predictability and rushed story take too much away to make it the kind of film that keeps audiences buzzing after it's over.",
