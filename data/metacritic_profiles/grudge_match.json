It doesn't really feel like you're watching a big rivalry between Sylvester Stallone and Robert DeNero, it feels more like slapstick comedy no one will remember, but never the less, it still brings in laughs and touches a little on the main stars. Overall, it's a decent re-hash of former Rocky and Jack! I give it a B-! Be sure to check out my YouTube channel, \"TheMovieManLife\" for all things movies.",

      "text": "Va bene, a mente fredda si finisce per pensare che, in fondo, \u00e8 una stupidata. Per\u00f2, stando al gioco, ci si diverte per un centinaio di minuti senza troppi pensieri: basta lasciarsi andare alla sfacciata inverosimiglianza e osservare i due vecchi leoni fare il verso al proprio passato e sovente gigioneggiare appoggiati a una storia in cui non mancano spunti e battute (dopo pochi minuti, De Niro proclama \u2018sono un grande attore\u2019 mentre a Stallone viene vietato di prendere a pugni i quarti di manzo in una cella frigorifera). Razor (Sly) e il Kid (Bob) si odiano da trent\u2019anni \u2013 da cui il titolo originale \u2018Il match del rancore\u2019 - per motivi sportivi e sentimentali: da quando il primo ha rinunciato al confronto che avrebbe dovuto sancire la superiorit\u00e0 di uno dei due (e alla boxe tutta) dopo che il secondo gli ha messo incinta la fidanzata (Basinger e, nelle immagini degli anni Ottanta, la figlia Ireland). Dante, il tascabile erede del vecchio promoter (un Kevin Hart che fa parecchio il verso a Eddie Murphy), prova a resuscitare la sfida per soldi e i due, dopo qualche tentennamento accettano: Razor ha un posto di lavoro traballante e mantiene il vecchio allenatore (Alan Arkin fa il Burt Young senza la vena di amarezza ma con un rumorosissimo apparecchio acustico) mentre Kid \u00e8 un vanaglorioso figlio di buona donna e non pu\u00f2 certo tirarsi indietro. Inizia cos\u00ec l\u2019allenamento parallelo, in cui si inserisce il figlio della colpa come manager di pap\u00e0, e si arriva alla grande sfida davanti a mezza Pittsburgh: dodici round di irreale scazzottamento a guardia bassa (del resto i due sono stati protagonisti di match cinematografici tra i pi\u00f9 sanguinolenti della storia) al termine del quale Razor grida \u2018Adrianaaaaaa\u2019 \u2013 no, ok, stavo scherzando \u2013 e Kid recupera un po\u2019 di dignit\u00e0. Ambientata in una periferia urbana abbastanza anonima, la sceneggiatura di Tim Kelleher e Rodney Rothman delinea due antagonisti tagliati con l\u2019accetta mettendo via via pi\u00f9 a fuoco il confronto tra un \u2018buono\u2019 e un \u2018cattivo\u2019 o, quantomeno, un \u2018simpatico\u2019 e un \u2018antipatico\u2019: Stallone \u00e8 monolitico come di prammatica nell\u2019interpretare il rude-ma-sensibile Razor mentre De Niro (il cui doppiaggio lo fa sempre sembrare strafatto di elio) utilizza il suo ghigno beffardo per rendere la meschinit\u00e0 che contraddistingue il suo personaggio. Il grande Bob d\u00e0 l\u2019impressione di divertirsi e rende assai di pi\u00f9 rispetto ai tanti ruoli \u2018alimentari\u2019 interpretati di puro mestiere in varie commedie degli ultimi anni, e anche gli altri attori sembrano condividere l\u2019atmosfera generale, con la spalla comica di Arkin che si fa preferire a quella sopra le righe di Hart, mentre Basinger \u2013 il cui personaggio \u00e8 nonna di un bimbo di otto anni \u2013 rende lustro ai miracoli della chirurgia estetica. Il regista Peter Segal mette in immagini il tutto senza voli pindarici, ma con una buona attenzione al ritmo e un\u2019inevitabile attenzione al citazionismo visivo: il risultato \u00e8 un onesto prodotto medio che si regge sul carisma dei suoi interpreti e che assolve al suo compito di divertire senza troppi retropensieri accompagnato da una simpatica colonna sonora d\u2019epoca (\u2018Back in black\u2019 degli AC/DC accompagna Razor sull\u2019ultimo ring). Da notare che i titoli di coda sono inframezzati da un paio di scenette conclusive (non al termine del rullo, perci\u00f2 non c\u2019\u00e8 da aspettare tanto): in una, Dante cerca di organizzare un nuovo incontro fra Tyson e Holyfield \u2013 li chiama per cognome per farli riconoscere, si suppone \u2013 prendendosi i suoi rischi.",

And the 10 year old boy in me wanted Rocky Balboa vs Jake La Motta to be great. But realistically it's absolutely ridiculous. Ultimately this is a cringe worthy parody just trying to cash in on the former glory of two much loved and iconic characters. I love the Rocky films, but this is one boxing film too many for Sylvester Stallone. And it's embarrassing here to think Robert De Niro was once the Raging Bull. Alan Arkin is fun in a supporting role and I suppose for a glimmer of nostalgia that the fight is worth a watch once. But otherwise this is a tired and cheap gimmick.",
