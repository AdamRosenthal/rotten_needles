I did like this movie almost as much as some of my favorite Coen films, such as Fargo and Blood Simple, and much more than No Country For Old Men (to be fair, that movie was very faithful to the novel, which I read, and I felt the movie contained all the same problems as the book).  The crafting of the film is excellent, with my only problem being that the actress portraying the older Mattie looks nothing like 14 year-old Mattie....Scanning the critics' reviews, I see the only one who really didn't like it is Rex Reed, and that is probably because there is no hint of male homosexuality in the movie.",

      "text": "True Grit is the first western based film presented to us by the Coen brothers. The Coens combine their original and witty dialogue with incredible performances by top notch actors to create a film thats so engrossing that you're taken on a ride back in time with true outlaws. The plot centers on Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld) whose father was shot and killed by a loner named Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin), who also made off with the father's 2 gold pieces. Mattie is determined at all costs to find her father's killer, and hires U.S. Marshal Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges) to do the job. A Texas Ranger named La Boeuf (Matt Damon) arrives on the scene already hot on Chaney's trail over a murder he committed in Texas. The trio set off together in hopes of finding Tom Chaney before anyone else does. The plot delves in deeper than that of course, and it emerges as a true Western flick that actually works. While it doesn't involved all that heavily on action (minus a few great scenes), it's involved mostly on the characters and the experiences that they must face. With the Coen's classic dialogue (equivalent to Fargo) the slower paced scenes are genuinely enjoyable because the most random of conversations will occur and the outcome is either hilarious or heartwarming. Jeff Bridges is flawless and Oscar worthy portraying a Rooster Cogburn so exceptionally well that he completely overshadows John Wayne's portrayal multiple times over. Matt Damon is unrecognizable at first as a desperate Ranger though his times on the big screen are enjoyable especially the many quarrels with Bridges such as arguments on who is the better shot. Hailee Steinfeld is completely flawless as well. Her portrayal of a headstrong 14 year old determined to track one man down is so spot on that I actually tricked myself into thinking I was watching an adult in the same role. The supporting roles of Josh Brolin and Berry Pepper were great as always, although their screen time was dwindled down to only a small percentage, but both of their roles are great. The many different camera angles the Coens use really outlay a vast and open landscape to the many different types of crimes committed there. The pacing is slick and perfect. The many action scenes are great and house outstanding shootouts and they aren't as heavy on the violence as the earlier Coen brothers films. In between the few key action scenes, there are the funny and enjoyable dialogue moments that keep the momentum in place and this style never falls flat. All in all True Grit really delivers a stellar experience that zooms through quick from beginning to end thanks in part to the great action scenes, and the truly flawless characters and dialogue. If you're in to look for a great Western film, this is the one true and great modern experience.",

True Grit is about the attempt to be heroic in the face of the realities of life, that is, filled with violence, randomness, personal failings and our questionable chances to control what happens to us.  There are potential traps with this story: if the girl is precious the movie can veer towards sentimentality and life is anything but sentimental.  Each of the characters show the balance that exists in people.  Rooster Cogburn is not heroic in most senses of the word.  He admits that he was a terrible father, he kicks the Indian kids off of the porch, he sets up a plan to help the girl while he pursues his money by attempting to catch the leader villain.  The Texas ranger is quite simply a doofus, and yet miraculously makes the shot with the rifle.  He doesn't re-enter the story.  Finally, the girl devotes her childish mind to revenge, which we should know, offers no reward but ashes.  She finishes as a one armed spinster, she is not cute and she finds solace only in her grit.  For me, I am old enough not to expect perfect heroic people or even a chance to act nobly in many situations, but the film shows perhaps what is the best that we can do.  Finally, the cinematography, much like Fargo or No Country for Old Men, shows the open spaces in a way that immerses the audience and reminds us of the beauty, the physical beauty, of America.  Most seriously considered art deals with the challenges that life presents us with, what to do with our lives, and as an American, I feel uplifted and excited each time I see the Coen Brothers attempt to illustrate the issue with a new filter, whether it be set in very un-Hollywood locations as Texas, Arkansas, Minnesota or North Dakota.  My son suggested that for the United States, the art form that is ours the most (apart of course from Rock and Roll) is film and that the brothers are our true geniuses of that art form.",

But after watching this movie, I feel like the enlightened one in a sea of gullible moviegoers! Can anyone else appreciate just how TERRIBLE this movie was? First: the script plays on screen like it was written by a school child. Sure, there's some witty one-liners and laugh-inducing reparte now and then, but in the context of a (supposedly) serious film, these parts of the dialogue transpire with the feel of a cheap David Spade movie... (not that there's anything wrong with David Spade movies, it just doesn't belong here). Second: certain scenes of this move are ABSOLUTE GARBAGE, and do nothing in the way of character development or plot advancement! The man in the tree who Rooster Cogburn \"does not know\"... The painfully awkward, random meeting with the medicine man in the bearskin... the inane, often incomprehensible ramblings of Cogburn... the lame-ass cornbread shooting contest... Do you need another four WORTHLESS scenes from this film? I'd be happy to list them. Third: I think it would be fair to say that this movie *attempts* to portray a special bond between Cogburn and the little girl, Mattie Ross. To steal a line from today's youth: EPIC FAIL. Jeff Bridges is a (usually) great actor, and Hailee Steinfeld seems like a wonderful young actress. But taken together, these two have the chemistry of oil and water... Summary thoughts: This movie is boring, hamstrung by hollywood cliches, rather poorly acted, INCREDIBLY poorly written, has a very uninspiring \"gotcha, bad guy!\" moment, and perhaps shouldn't have even been (re)made in the first place. The 2 points I have awarded are for the (surely unintentional) entertainment value derived from the aforementioned campy one-liners, and overdone, humor-inducing melodrama...

I know they were fans of the original, but my experience with them made me believe they were going to take the original and improve it dramatically the Coen Brothers way.  Well...they didn't.  In fact, this was the most un-Coen Brothers movie I've ever seen.  Not to say that is a bad thing, but having just watched the original, I could have not seen this version entirely and not missed anything.  Being fans of the original, they clearly wanted to pay homage to the original.  In fact, dialogue and setting-wise, it was about a 90% carbon copy of the original, down to the shots, the script and the way the characters were portrayed.  The Coen Brothers really didn't do much to put their stamp on the film, except maybe the perfect casting.  Aside from very minor differences throughout the film (such as Mattie covering the chimney to smoke out the first couple of ruffians rather than LaBoeuf and having LaBoeuf interact with Ned Pepper the first time instead of Rooster), the only meaningful change in the script is the last 30 minutes.  I've never read the book, but the compliments given to this version is that it is more like the book.  That must mean the ending.  It is very different, and honestly, better than the original.  However, anyone could have done this film the way it was done.  The Coen Brothers didn't do anything to make this film special, so I'm grading it as an average film.  I hope they enjoyed making it more than I enjoyed watching it and I look forward to them returning to their style soon.",

Though expected performances from both Jeff Bridges and Matt Damon, newcomer Hailee Stenfeld was as good as her castmates. The one thing I kept in mind while going in this film was that Bridges and Damon are going to give applausable performances and Hailee Steinfeld was getting nominated for some major awards. But when I was finished, I didn't see what all the buzz was about. Sure, Steinfield was good, but compared to Bridges and Damon, she sure didn't have much. I have to say though, beating thousands of other girls for this role is impressive, but I'm sure other Hollywood stars had to do that as well. Even though I find her not as great as I hoped, she still delivered well.",

The girl, Maggie spoke too sophisticated for a 14 year old, and seemed too rehearsed at times.  The old vigilante cowboys even seemed to speak this way at times, and it came off as unauthentic.  Maggie looked mixed race (white/black) and I'm wondering if this was intentional to appeal to a wider audience?  I definitely don't think that was the \"norm\" in the 1800's.  Whole thing seemed unauthentic and stiff.  Thumbs down on the scenery and acting.  Definitely didn't hold up to the original.

      "text": "The original \"True Grit\", directed by Henry Hathaway, and starring, no less than \"The Duke\" himself, made its initial theatrical run in 1969, just two years after Arthur Penn's \"Bonnie and Clyde\" blew away the production code. Once Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway went down spasmodically in a hail of gunfire, that was that, and there would be blood forevermore. No more smuggling. The days of \"beating around the bush\" were over. No more fade to black. You could \"hump the hostess\". In Elia Kazan's \"Baby Doll\", released in 1956, smack dab in the middle of a sexually repressed era, the handcuffed filmmaker somehow managed to adapt \"27 Wagons Full of Cotton\", the Tennessee Williams play that depicted a middle-aged man's eroticization of his underage wife, without getting arrested on indecency charges. While neither Archie Lee(Karl Malden) nor Silva(Eli Wallach) get anywhere near first base with the titular character(Carroll Baker) in the official narrative, the first generation Italian does have implied sex with her, twice, suggested by a phallic symbol in one instance, and the cotton baron's dry humping performance(while mounted on her hobby horse) in another. Whereas \"Baby Doll\" predictably focuses on the man's needs, and likewise, in the John Wayne vehicle, LaBoeuf's libido is on display when he expresses his wish to kiss Mattie Ross(Kim Darby), this seemingly square western, with the utmost subtlety, delves into the fourteen-year-old girl's growing pains, in which her crush on the Texas Ranger runs deeper than the stealing glances she aims his way at the boarding house dinner table. When LaBoeuf inquires Mattie about her name, the young girl excuses herself from his company and adjourns to bed. Away from the menfolk, the recently bereaved girl and the boarding house owner gab about the strapping young lad, both agreeing, do the smitten pair, that the federal marshal is handsome. Before the lights are turned out, the girl cries, the waterworks being attributed to her slain father, no doubt, but also, perhaps, out of guilt, for feeling the first pangs of lust. Suggested by the snake pit she later falls into, in all likelihood, Mattie touched herself. There's a sin involved, but it can't be murder, since Cheney(Jeff Corey) is still breathing after the recoil due to Mattie's firing, which only grazes his head, so the snake bite that the girl endures must correspond to some earlier transgression. (Rooster Cogburn kills Cheney. John Wayne has to be the hero, even a deeply flawed one.) In the remake, Mattie pays for the self-induced orgasm with her hand. Seen as an adult, the moviegoer can't help but perceive Mattie's missing appendage as a scarlet limb. Unlike the original, it's Cogburn(Jeff Bridges) whom Mattie(Hailee Steinfeld) admires, initially anyways, as indicated by her divulgence to LaBoeuf(Matt Damon) that she had chosen the wrong man. Bridges' rendering of the one-eyed marshal contains none of the inappropriate feelings that may have stirred in his predecessor's heart. As Mattie bandages the Texas Ranger's hand at the McAllister homestead, Cogburn appears miffed by her charity. Why? Does he have sex on his mind? Maybe. Because Darby was twenty-two at the time, to a certain extent, \"True Grit\" could get away with its pedophilic undertones. Conversely, Steinfeld is age-appropriate, so when Damon repeats Campbell's line about stealing kisses, he comes across more strongly as a child molester. The filmmaker leaves out Wayne's original comment about LaBoeuf  \"enjoying it too much\"; the Texan's spanking of Mattie's behind, probably out of fear that the hunting party would resemble some sort of unseemly threesome, a malodorous \"Jules & Jim\" playing wet nurse to a lolita. Ultimately, the most striking feature about this otherwise well-dressed mounting of the ultimate John Wayne experience(\"The Searchers\" was John Ford's bag) is its political incorrectness, or rather, the arch self-awareness that many westerns were shameless in their depiction of Native Americans. Right away, \"True Grit\" announces itself as the anti-\"Dances with Wolves\", in which an Indian's speech is cut-off by the executioner's hooding of the tribesman, disturbingly enough, to comic effect, just before he dangles at the public hanging. Later, at the site of an abandoned house, the liquored up law officer kicks two small \"red-skinned\" children off from the structure's wooden foundation without any protestation from his female companion. (Mattie names her horse Blackie in front of a \"Negro\" stable-boy.) In another sense, Mattie loses her fingers because she didn't lift a single finger to stop the needless cruelty of those innocents.",

Yes, it was paced slow. Yes, there were scenes where they are just babbling or doing nothing. Yes, it lacks the theatrics and (overdone) aesthetics of recent movies. But I don't imagine a western journey being fast - paced, easy or pleasurable, or very exciting. Why were there boring and slow scenes? That's all they could do while they traveled. In terms of the acting, I think Matt Damon was miscast - not a terrible job on his part, but it was lacking in believability. He does the accent pretty well, but he's just not a cowboy. Hallie Steinfeld was great - the maturity and stubbornness was spot on. But Jeff Bridges was my favorite portrayal. I thought he was perfect for the role.

I was a little nervous on how Jeff Bridges was going to do in regards to taking on John Wayne's previous role and surprisingly, I thought he did a pretty good job. As a whole, I thought all of the acting was well done and particularly thought Hailee Steinfeld did an excellent job with portraying the role of Mattie Ross. I also thought some scenes were better than the original, like the scene where Rooster is trying to squeeze the information out of the two men in the cabin and one guy chops the other guys fingers off and stabs him in the heart and Rooster blows that guy's head off. I thought that seen kept the suspense moving and really moved the audience. However, I thought the first half of the movie really didn't build up the story at all and the fact that an hour of the movie took place in the town, I felt like that made the second half of the movie (the action scenes) feel rushed and we, the audience, didn't get the feeling of evil that is supposed to be portrayed through the rival gang of cowboys. The other thing that I felt really hurt the movie was the focus that was on how Rooster is a drunk. There was probably 3 different scenes that was focusing on how he's a drunk and I felt like that really hurt the plot. Overall, I thought the movie was good but most definitely not as good as the original. Hats off to you John Wayne...",

Everyone involved here has risen to the challenge. Having just viewed the original John Wayne version, this one is far superior in almost every way, starting with the sharp, witty script, which often prompts the viewer to ponder over the sometimes antiquated, but always revealing turns-of-phrases. Perhaps this is why some viewers have suggested the film is too talky and slow. In fact, much of the film's action takes place in the dialogue between the characters, rather than merely in the form of physical action. The performances, as noted by all the reviews, are uniformly memorable, but Jeff Bridges is truly great here. The cinematography is beautiful in a stark and haunting way, and the score, by the Cohen Bros. consistent collaborator Carter Burwell, is stirring. The characters here, unlike most westerns, have shades of gray, and all but the most vile of them retain a sense of humanity. This is probably the most emotionally effecting, and also one of the wittiest westerns I've ever seen.",

What sets it apart however is the quest for vengeance by a young tough as nails heroine who just happens to be 12!!!She holds the movie togethor and although she doesnt let us into her cold as stone interior, we understand her and feel fer her. Jeff Bridges and Matt Damon are equals unto each other and the banter between all is masterfully handeled by the Coen Brothers. The movie is dark, gritty and moves along at a steady gallop and builds to a satisfying finale. The master stroke for me however was how the ending reminded me that as with all of our lives...our biggest adventures are simply a page or a chapter and nothing more!!!",

Of course it has nothing to do the fact that is starring Jeff Bridges, Matt Damon and Josh Brolin... I'm kidding, they're gorgeous! Jeff Bridges has beaten then all... if there is a Leading actor award, you've got it right here! What a acting, mixing that comedy-drama role, who in the Holy Mother of God can do that as good as him... or at least who can do it? Thanks Jeff for a great movie... then you have Matt Damon, in the 2nd line, you know, hard to say what I'm really thinking... but, well.. after all is Matt D. (what would u expect?)... he was too funny really really funny too, great job there. I was really expecting to see more about Josh Brolin, but, well, he had not such a big part in the movie I guess, but he was perfect too.

While the acting was universally strong, the cinematography beautiful and the look authentic the film seemed to misfire. There are several very long passages that meander and are rather dull. The journey section picks the pacing up but, still there is very little suspense until the final twenty minutes. Jeff Bridges owns the role of Rooster Cogburn. He is a man's man, heroic, brave and gritty. Damon too is earnest and steadfast at Texas Ranger LaBoeuf. Newcomer Hailey Steinfeld, as Hattie Ross, truly holds her own these veteran actors. Her determination, poise and resolve are very powerful to watch, she is an engaging and compelling character. Perhaps having seen the original John Wayne version in the last year took away some of the impact. The action sequences were exciting and unverving. On the whole it was just okay. I would love to see the Coen Brothers write an original wester film. I don't think True Grit needed a re-telling, the first was less than stellar.

As with any Coen Brothers we get several scenes of hilarious and quirky dialogue, which I highly enjoy from them. Bridges was good but not his best (I thought his voice was a bit much), and Damon continues to impress in his varied roles. I came into the movie thinking Hailee Steinfeld would be cheesy and over-the-top, but I think she really held her own and gave strong believability to the feisty young main character. A well deserved Oscar nod in her case, much like Jennifer Lawrence in \"Winter's Bone\". The soundtrack was FANTASTIC, as was some of the subtle ironic cinematography. My main complaints are in the the ending, Bridge's voice, and the seemingly pointless behavior of some of the characters (often a complaint I have with some Coen Brothers characters).

True Grit might stand out as One of the Best Cowboy Remakes but it has its powers to stand on its own. The direction of the camera and the scenic landscapes all add depth to the film, accompanied by Carter Burwell's piano-driven score. The story is about a 14 year old girl named Mattie who wants to avenge her father's death but not without the help of a Marshal. She chooses Mr. One-Eye-Patched Rooster Cogburn played by Jeff Bridges, who manages to be convincing enough. Matt Damon and Josh Brolin also play as supporting (enemies) characters.",

The redemption story is done pretty well and it's a good central driving force that keeps the plot moving forward. Jeff Bridges does a good job as the US marshal Rooster Cogburn. Matt Damon also does a great job with his character a Texas Ranger named LaBoeuf. The most surprising performance came from the new comer, Hailee Steinfeld who caries most of the film. Steinfeld does a great job as the lead character, it's pretty impressive. I guess my only complaint with the film is that there are a few pacing issues, there were times when i admittedly began to wander off wondering when something would happen. Just as soon as boredom would set in, though, an action scene or an argument between the characters would break out and would instantly snap me back into the film.

The acting was quite good. The pacing was well balanced and I never became bored. Jeff Bridges delivers a memorable performance definitely worthy of the Oscar. The movie deserved the Oscar more than The King's Speech, which failed to move me. If they keep on making westerns like this, I will continue to watch them.",

Many critics and alot of viewers have raved about how this new version is much better than the original. However, I personally feel like it's not that much better than the original. This version adds alot to the story, but even with a fresh touch and interpretation, the story didn't feel all that intense nor interesting. With this being said, this fault may not even be because of the films; the story is adapted from a book. That's really my only sort of negative thing about the film. I was led on to believe this new version is tons better than the original, but I liked them both about the same.",

The story moves a lot faster than the old one and these actors seem to fit their roles a lot better than the actors in the original. My favorite part was the climax. It was so much more satisfying than the old True Grit's sappy last 5 minutes. In this ending, nothing is completely happy and forced. It's cool how it doesn't explain Matt Damon's fate. That makes the ending way cooler when you don't know what happens to every single character.",

Originally Mattie does seem like a parent to me because of her tremendous responsibility of actually finding her father's murderer and the way she orders the men Cogburn and LaBoeuf around to do what she wants.",
