I hoped that more of the cast would come but I was glad to see Marjane Satrapi. I know Reynolds is shooting Deadpool so he gets a pass, as for Aterton I know she has her musical but London is a mere two hour train ride away she could have made an effort. Anyway, Satrapi quickly spoke about how the movie came about. Persepolis and her Oscar nomination for it changed her life. Her American agent offered a lot of projects that she wasn't feeling but to me it sounds like they sort of put her in a box. But The Voices was different and refreshing from what she had dine so far, so she went for it and in my opinion it was a good decision.",
