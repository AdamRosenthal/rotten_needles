Pixar again creates gorgeous visuals and a setting that is truly stunning, its charming and funny throughout. Performances are top notch and laughs are real laugh out loud ones, its every thing you could hope for in a film in one. The storytelling is stunning, creating morals, excitement and is very emotional at places. The film does not try to be this forced emotion present in most films, but is just there and is some of the most emotional scenes in film history.

But when a 9-year old obnoxious fellow swings on for the ride, Mr. Federickson has to learn to deal with him after a conflict arises once landing in South America. Up is definitely a film for the entire family to feel excited about. The intial first 10 minutes are very heartwarming, but loses that warmth a little once the adventure begins, soon feeling like a shorter, much toned down adventure once it ends. Without a doubt Pixar delivers quality animation once again, but the feeling is different once the end credits, the same I saw in Cars and Monster's Inc. But definitely another masterpiece for 2009.",

Unfortunately, I don't think that Up is nearly up to par with Pixar's best.  The movie starts out fantastic, but it quickly falls apart.  By the time we reach the second half, the movie has devolved into a mess.  I think my main problem with Up is that it is the only Pixar movie where I cannot nag the feeling that everything is so implausible.  How utterly unrealistic it was bothered me the whole movie, and this is saying something coming from someone who wasn't bothered by rats cooking.  None of the characters in Up are particularly memorable.  It just didn't connect with me in the way that other Pixar movies have.",

The only thing preventing from hating this one is the incredible voice performance from Ed Asner and the fantastic animation, as always, from Pixar. However, the rest really left much to be desired. I hated the beginning and did not find it sad in the least. It was cute sure, but I hate montages. This one is no different. It is a major storytelling cop-out and, as a result, it never resonated with me when the end result was revealed. Even more, that wound up being the best part of the story, which is truly astonishing. After creating this real, believable world, it delves into the absurd, stupid, and incredibly dumb (talking dogs?). The film felt so manufactured and manicured, it seemed to me that Pixar had found a formula they thought worked and could plug any story into. Tragically, it did not work with Up as it felt entirely fake and, as such, that prevented me from feeling any sort of emotion. I thought it would be this sad, funny, and entirely charming, experience, but instead I was left feeling incredibly annoyed as I waited for yet another lame attempt at a joke and some juvenile talk on the emotional impact of losing your spouse. Just let the damn house float away you moron. Plus, I have to ask; wouldn't Russell's mother wonder where the heck her son went? How can this old man, who is shown to be unable to do much of anything, be so agile towards the end? Just the magic of being around an annoying child? Anyways, Up is massively overrated. Though technically brilliant and Asner is a complete delight, so it is not all for naught, but I wonder if I watched a different film. The one I had had the worst storytelling of any Pixar film I have seen, felt completely contrived, and lack any sort of emotion. Instead, it was a dumb adventure romp that felt fake. Yes, I know Toy Story is about talking toys, but it feels real. Here, it felt like a bad parody of other Pixar films",

It's so random that I might have learn't a lesson in chaos. Had they concentrated on the relationship between Carl and his late wife more, the film would have been far more interesting. After a while the boredom wears off and it just gets annoying. Even for a children's film, dog's flying planes is just silly. It's the overload of plot devices that really brings down the film.

The problem with these commercial films is that their whole purpose is to make money out of amateur movie goers rather than make something that should critically make sense.",
