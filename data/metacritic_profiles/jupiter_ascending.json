The story is very fast moving, and in this, I wish they had spent a little more time crafting the plot and having more emotion in the acting, particularly concerning \"harvesting\" or how long should society extend life past a normal 90 years.  It would have been fun to explore more of the world, but maybe this would be better for a game, than a movie.  There's something elegant about the movie.  Maybe its the way the bees react to royalty and the elegantly crafted and thought out world building.

The identity of the movie made a bumpy ride, but it always recovered. I whole-heartedly recommend Jupiter Ascending & believe a lot of lazy or cowardly bloggers/reviewers passed on forgivable negatives like wildfire. Frame of mind is always crucial going into a movie. I think going in w/ a purpose, to enjoy a space opera, expecting the worst will allow you to enjoy Jupiter to the fullest.

I also definitely liked some of the things they ended up doing with the Sci-Fi and how they introduced Jupiter to the greater universe. I also enjoyed how they explained a great deal of the 'aliens' being human while still including alien races. Despite the story being somewhat simplistic, the universe has great potential for expansion though I'm not sure another movie would be a good medium for it. I'd read the book though.

More interesting is the fact that this movie explores the theme of the origin of our species as other movie did recently, such as Prometheus, the notion that we may not be the only intelligent society in the universe. The fundamentals themes remain those of the Wachowskis, very close to the Matrix and Cloud Atlas, a quest for freedom of choice, the fight for the release from slavery, exploitation of the body and mind of Mankind to keep them in an altered state which is the result of a manipulation scheme based on the power of lies and ignorance and the moral consequence that comes from the awakening from those lies.

In fact, my 3 rating is high, due to my love for the genre and the Wachowskis. I did love Speed Racer and the Matrix, and I've enjoyed the Wachowskis other movies if not loved. Jupiter Ascending let me down in so many ways. The first half of the movie I found great. Whenever we were on Earth I was pleased. Smiling in my seat. Wowed by the special effects. When we leave Earth it all fell apart. The acting was all very well done, even Tatums. I don't care how well the digital effects are, they just do not move me in anyway. While on earth the gravity boots, the makeup, the digital effects mixed in real-world areas or sets all fantastic. The planet Jupiter was good. The rest just felt so awkward and emotionless. Maybe because we have seen this before, for many years, starting with the oft besmirched star wars. Putting the search for realistic eyes in a digital world aside the story is a complete and utter failure after we leave earth. As if they ran out of story and decided to just repeat what they did on earth in space. More of Kunis character Jupiter falling and being saved by gravity boots. Lots more. This isn't the creative repetition as with the matrix that lets us see the computer world of the matrix is being created on the fly, no this is we have completely run out of time or ideas. Have these movie directors learned nothing from the past? we could have stayed on Earth and armed Jupiter's excellent Russian family and had them fighting with slapstick humor and it would have been a hit. they could have wrote in a story about humans that know of the plot but are helping it along for the love of money. Instead we get repeated extremely lifeless set pieces that we have already seen at the beginning of this movie. So instead, we have another grand missed opportunity. And that is a shame, because no one can do this like the Wachowskis, and every failure will stop more space operas from hitting the big screen. Tisk tisk Wachowski brothers. And tisk tisk to all of your friends who obviously know nothing, or are too afraid to say anything about the course of your creations to you. The moral of the story is you don't need to own galaxies and cleaning up poop ain't so bad as long as you have a wolf-man with flying boots? Did you know you were making such a bad movie so you tried to force feed us an ideal that would let us cope?  Signed: devoted but bewildered fan. I hope you make enough to get another chance.

How can something be so smart and so stupid at the same time? Like the gigantic space station which reacts violently with whatever is outside it as soon as it gets a tiny leak. I'm watching amazing space ships travel to exotic words with bizarre aliens. And a disproportionate amount of screen-time is dedicated to Mila Kunis scrubbing toilets. What the heck? Maybe this movie would have worked better as a mini-series, so each of the stories they obviously wanted to tell could be given enough time and told well. And you know what? Maybe then I'd skip the sappy love story episode, and the hard luck immigrant story and enjoy a Sci-Fi political story reminiscent of dune.",

It has the nostalgic moments thanks to the amazing reconstruction of certain Cloud Atlas scores by Michael Giacchino, the performances from the cast however is a bit mixed - nothing surprise from Tatum and Kunis thanks to the cheesy dialogues, but Eddie Redmayne as the main antagonist role looks promising though with limited screen time. Overall, this new version of Star Wars space universe is still an enjoying formulaic blockbuster with its intense actions and eye popping visual effects even if the directors themselves ended up confused and misfiring ambitious at the wrong directions.",

My take on Jupiter Ascending is that it didn't live up the hype and delaying a supposed summer release just killed any chances of taking the box office crown. And it probably seems that The Wachowskis have fallen off their empire from bomb after bomb. I won't take away the cast in this choice of filmmaking, I have to give credit for adding Channing Tatum, Mila Kunis, and soon-to-be Oscar favorite, Eddie Redmayne for putting an excellent job on their performance. As for the rest, I felt that the film is overhyped at some point. The story and nature of the film is confusing and the dialogue was nowhere near perfection. I hoped Andy and Lana Wachowski should be able to make up a whole new idea instead of making poor timing over marketing issues. Like say reboot the whole Matrix Trilogy thing and besides, if you want to get your fanbase back to where it belongs, don't let the past fooled you and try again. I don't wanna hate on Jupiter Ascending because the CGI effects are amazing, very well crafted. Along with a dazzling blush of fantastic visuals and a beautiful look of sci-fi apple pie. Unfortunately, I really hate it when a film I was so dying to see in 2014 just cost my wallet and it's just a shame why this film falls flat. I suggest for myself see this movie first and then wait for a rental. Better luck next movie, Wachowskis. At least you've did your best.

Channing Tatum and Mila Kunis both do alright in this movie, they aren't terrible although they were both definitely brought in as a cash grab because they are two of the most popular and attractive people in the business right now. The real dud performer in this movie is Oscar winner Eddie Redmayne. Redmayne has one of the stupidest and most annoying voices ever in film and he looked so stupid that every time he was in frame I became annoyed.

      "text": "Cinema-goers need a fresh movie from the makers of  the 'Matrix' films, but this movie isn't for them they don't need to see the Wachowskis new blockbuster \"Jupiter Ascending.\" If \"Guardians of The Galaxy\" were here they would of saved Jupiter Ascending's cheesy dialogue and it's unnecessary soap opera, we might of had a great film (almost). Jupiter Jones (Mila Kunis) was born under the signs that predicated her future greatness, but in reality she cleans people's houses and cleans toilets also wants endless breaks. Every single morning when her alarm clock goes off at  4:54, in the morning she says \"I hate my life\" before she spends her day scrubbing the toilets. Jupiter  doesn't know that she holds mankind's future in her hands she does not realize it yet. Caine (Channing Tatum) a genetically engineered hunter with the DNA of half-wolf and half-man, who arrives on earth to locate Jupiter, making her aware that destiny awaits her: Jupiter's genetic signature marks her next in line, extraordinary inheritance that could alter her the balance of the cosmos. The coolest scene ever in Jupiter Ascending which Caine has super cool boots my favorite scene. There are three heirs to the Abrasax industries dynasty, Kalique (Tuppence Middleton) tries to befriend Jupiter because Jupiter she has the key to an eternal life for Kalique; Titus (Douglas Booth) who wants Jupiter to marry him, so that he could kill her and take her inheritance away from Jupiter. Balem (Eddie Redmayne) wants Jupiter dead dead dead and now. The villain in this movie isn't really all that important or strong also the greatest in movie history, Eddie Redmayne who's a talented actor could give such a terrible performance he sounds like a British woman. Channing Tatum was missed cast and so was Kunis, obviously better actors could of have been in this B-movie. Mediocre movies have copied of the Wachowskis \"Matrix\" films, well this is a mediocre movie! Well even the makers of \"Matrix\" are copying of it, their also copying off of \"Star Wars\" and \"The Wizard of Oz\". If there's one thing The Wachowskis can achieve in their sc-fi blockbusters is create beauteous special effects and the art of an action scene. The score by Michael Giacchino is perfect and is elegant. Grade B-",

That could be said about all the actors who were literally lost in the plot and could not establish a connection with the other characters. I don't blame the actors though, truly, they did what they could, but there was no substance, no story line, no anything besides visual effects. This movie had the potential to be amazing, a possible franchise but nothing of value was even hinted at. The origins of humanity (which is not Earth), the royal families in space, the type of businesses, Jupiter's past and inheritance, the Abrasax kids and the rivals in the industry.....nothing, nothing related to that.....Sweet lord, this could have been amazing. Not to mention, that the dialogue was mediocre, the technology they presented was brushed off with no insight and Tatum is some kind of human-doggy with the emotional range of a pissed off Edward Cullen. While, of course, Mila Kunis is there to be pretty, not breaking a sweat at the fact that she discovered in a matter of hours that she owns half the universe, her identity is uncommon, she jumps off of buildings, gets used very fast with talking lizards and alien tech. By no means would she freak out about, well, anything. Her job is to look pretty in alien couture and hit on Tatum's canine charms.

As someone who loves sci-fi movies I have practically seen it all but  I truly enjoyed the unique sci-fi elements that Jupiter Ascending had to offer. While many other sci-fi movies explore the nearly infinite possibilities of space and time too this one brought to viewers several important lessons that tie into those infinite possibilities.",

I don't mean that as a criticism either. Silly, mindless, over the top, fantasy/scifi can be fun and appealing. I think a lot of the glaring problems would have still been apparent but I could have probably overlooked them with a little more ease back then.",
