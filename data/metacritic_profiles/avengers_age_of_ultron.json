The first film wasn\u2019t actually too bad, but Marvel have reached their nadir here with this preposterously over long (Eugene O\u2019Neill long is right!) bum numbing drivel. It suffers from an excess of toos. Aside from being too long, there\u2019s too much noise, too much exposition and too much nonsensical talk. In fact, too much of everything bar entertainment. It is essentially brain dead gibberish. Ok, so the special effects are as predictably good as they should be for a film of this budget but everything else falls way short. The actors\u2019 characterisations add nothing by way of compensation. Indeed, two members of the \u2018B\u2019 rated cast distinguish themselves by not cutting it even alongside this low standard of performance. Aaron Taylor-Johnson seems to whisper his way through the film as if not convinced he should be there, and Samuel L Jackson is just laughable in his eye patch. He has never been able to live up to his iconic early performance in \u2018Pulp Fiction\u2019 and most of his appearances these days are in thankless supporting parts like this. As in previous Marvel outings the attempts at humour fail miserably. However, unintentional laughter is evoked here by attempting, but failing, at pathos in a handful of scenes. The budding romance between Johansson and Ruffalo is lame and one only wishes that they would take their own advice to each other and \u2018Disappear\u2019. At the film\u2019s close as I raced for the exit I was only too well aware that everyone else was transfixed, eagerly anticipating the possible nuggets that were going to be thrown up during or after the credits. I knew that I need not stay as I was never going to encounter these characters again in my lifetime. Amazingly the critics have been surprisingly kind to this elephant sized mess. To re-energize my brain I went home and tuned into an episode of the TV series \u2018Wolf Hall\u2019, an entertainment of real pedigree that offered me more in five minutes than this did in 141.",

It did start out well, and did entertain me for a good deal of its running time so I can't say it was bad... but the finale is the same old, same old.  You never feel like any of the characters are in danger and none of it is as fun as it should have been.  A big comedown from the exciting first Avengers movie.",

Their accents are a little muddy but they make good bonuses for the team. I'm excited to see them grow in future Marvel movies. I would have liked it if they had shown more of Ultron though.

Even if they add new characters, there was no development at all. The movie had great humor without being forced and visually is brilliant with fantastic action scenes but the whole thing is just another copy from the first one...I hated the romance between Black Widow and Banner, it was so childish and painful to watch. The addition of Hawkeye's family was nothing special, total waste of time, it just seems pointless. They really needed to cut some scenes because it were super boring especially those in the farm...The Twins were fine, but the typical \"the villain is horrible so lets be good\" is already wasted. About the cast, Downey Jr. doing his thing, already annoys me, Stark's arrogance it was cool at the beggining but now it's just stupid. Evans was ok, nothing new and Hemsworth's Thor was just to give some comic relief. Bettany's Vision seems really good, probably the thing that i got most excited about it. Just like i said, Johansson and Ruffalo were completly ruined by that ridiculous \"chemistry\"...And i hope to see more of Jackson's Nick Fury because everytime he appears, he steals the show.

Given how the movie ends, it felt like it was all an experiment to see how well a third movie in the franchise could be if all of the stars decide not to return.  I suppose it stands to reason that Iron Man has had three standalone movies to cover that character, and that Hawkeye was completely underutilized in the first movie in the franchise, but I would have appreciated it if they could have found a better balance of screen time for this too huge cast.  It really felt like a producer told the writer that they had all of these high priced actors signed on to appear in the thing, so he had better come up with a scene featuring every single one of them, no matter how little it pertained to the plot or was entertaining, \u201cwe have exposition to explain, get that former TV actress in there\u201d.  I am a longtime fan of the director\u2019 (Joss Whedon), previous work.  I suppose he did a good job strictly as a director, as all of the actors put in fine performances, but the dialog and plot were all just very flimsy.  Maybe, there was a great move shot, and it was just edited together poorly.  Here I go apologizing for Joss, again.  I need to stop doing that.  I don\u2019t know, but either way, the experience was just not fun.  The camera was always zoomed in so close to the actors that I could never keep up with where anyone was within a scene.  I theorize that this was because the sets were either very underwhelming or all virtual, so the camera stayed in tight to prevent the audience from noticing.  Don\u2019t think that I failed to find any redeeming values in the movie.  The gags built around Thor\u2019s hammer were funny, and there was one stand out fight in the first half with the Hulk that had its moments, but you could watch these scenes on YouTube and skip the other two hours.  Let\u2019s face it.  If you have already seen every other modern Marvel movie, nothing is going to stop you from seeing this one.  Just make sure to set your expectations accordingly beforehand.  I still have hope that the Avengers franchise can be fun in future installments, but, in my opinion, they did not pull it off with this one.",

The other thing that people seem to complain about is Ultron being weak...he almost destroyed the entire planet and it took the whole team (not just Vision as some people incorrectly think--I don't even know where they get that from) to stop him.  There is also true hero stuff, people willing to sacrifice it all and not make the easy choice of saving the most vs few, but putting it all on the line to save everyone.

The combination of action, progression of the already intriguing story arc and character development, special effects, and humor make for a great viewing experience.

Also, James Spader did a marvelous job (get it?) as Ultron. He's truly one of the best. There were only really two disappointments I had with the movie at both happened in the very end. The first is that there was zero integration with the Agents of SHIELD television show. I thought that final scene where they're introducing the \"new team\" would've been the perfect opportunity to at least have a Colson cameo at the minimum. The other scene was when SHIELD came in at the end for support at Falcon was nowhere to be seen. Sorry but that would've been the perfect time to transition him with War Machine and the rest. Those disappointments aside, the only other elements that weren't perfect fall within the suspension of disbelief. Overall, another wonderful installment to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",

I felt \"Age of Ultron\" was kind of a misleading title as it was made to believe that Ultron was supposed to be this ultra convincing villain though I felt that Ultron was somewhat misused and was half as powerful as the Ultron that was in the comics. Overall, good movie with good performances from the main cast but ultimately it suffers from a long, and exhausting plot and a rather unconvincing or at least I thought so, Ultron.

It also represents a changing of the guard, so to speak, for the Marvel Universe. With their new focus geared more toward characters who have yet to have their own movies yet (Ant-man and Dr. Strange), the end to this movie does a good job in setting up what is to come, especially if they make a stand alone Spider man movie where he joins the Avengers later on. As for the movie itself, it certainly wasn't as dramatic as the first one was and alot of the impact was lost with a few too many faces. Also with the shift in direction, a few characters probably won't be heard of again until the next Avengers movie way down the line. However, this movie will probably be more remember for what it sets up than what actually happened. Ultron was a decent villain but certainly not memorable. And Tony Starks involvement in creating him and the consequences in doing it are kinda slipped under the rug. But, seeing as it is Whedon's last Marvel movie, I can kinda see him leaving a few holes here and there. There's also a definite problem with the number of characters introduced here. A few got lost in the shuffle IMO and the fact that they can't use the term \"Mutant\" because they don't own the rights to it also felt disingenuous. We all know what the Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver are and I felt like they thought I was stupid the entire time they said they were \"experiments\".",

      "text": "Writer/Director Joss Whedon received so much negative feedback from this film, that he actually deactivated his Twitter, but I can't understand why. It's not that Age of Ultron was a bad film, in fact there were many parts of it that were very impressive, but what bothered people was how Age of Ultron wasn't geared toward general audiences. In the first film, even if you'd never seen a Marvel film, you could follow the story and enjoy it, but that's not the case with the sequel. Age of Ultron is aimed more at the comic-con crowd and parts of it were very confusing to those of us who aren't familiar with the comics that the film is based on. There are a lot of new characters and new technologies introduced in this film, without any kind of background information given, and as the film progresses, it did become confusing. The story begins with the Avengers as a separate faction from Shield, centering on Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and David Banner (Mark Ruffalo) working to develop a new type of artificial intelligence. The pair believe that if they can create this intelligence, everyone can retire and won't have to fight anymore. As always there is a problem though, as the A.I., known as Ultron, comes to life and fails to see the distinction between saving humanity and destroying the planet for the protection of humanity. The film then becomes a race for the clock as the mighty Avengers try to stop Ultron from destroying the planet. We all know that sequels aren't as good as the original, because the creators change things too much and Age of Ultron is no exception. The story isn't even close to as strong as the first film, but that doesn't mean it wasn't good. The special effects are even better and the chemistry between the large cast is much more important then it had been previously. These things set the foundation for a better film, but the story fails to deliver. The Avengers is a monumental undertaking for cinema, with so many well known actors and characters trying to come together as one. The idea is ingenious and the technology behind the whole thing is nothing short of magic, but as far as films go, while I loved the first one, I could have done without Age of Ultron.",

I saw this twice in theaters and even the second time still greatly enjoyed it.  The action is properly balanced throughout the movie, and the tease for the third film is setting up what I think will be one epic & wild ride.  When you can put substance to cool characters and slick action scenes, you get great movies like Age of Ultron.  I highly recommend getting in on this with a big screen before the summer movies flood us all and it gets demoted to lesser screens or Redbox.",

All of the main cast members of the original film return for the sequel and the chemistry is as good as ever. The comedy is great I love the jokes that are scattered throughout the movie. Robert Downey Jr is of course amazing as Iron Man but he is just so funny in this movie and this is probably the funniest I've seen him. One of the downsides of the original film is there is not quite enough Hulk but there is lots of him in this film. The action sequences are amazing and there are so many stunts in the film that leave you in awe. Hawkeye gets more attention in this film as well and we learn more about his character which only makes the movie better. After this movie Hawkeye may not be considered the dud Avenger. Plus there are great classic performances from Chris Evans and Scarlett Johansson. Now there are also some new additions which I think are all added well and all are good strong characters. Quicksilver was certainly an interesting character I liked the effects they used when he ran and I also enjoyed Scarlet Witch who has already been confirmed as a returning character in the future. Then we have Vision who is amazing but doesn't get as much screen time as I would like but will likely play a bigger part in the coming films. Finally we have the villain Ultron. Ultron was not what I expected but he was not a disappointment either. James Spader does an excellent job for the voice but when I watched the trailer it looked like Ultron was going to be a villain we could love that was dark and complex. He is more sarcastic and funny than anything. I liked Ultron but I did not love him. The only other problem I have with this movie is I thought it needed to be longer. Director Joss Whedon has said already that the film was originally 3 hours long but 40 minutes were cut. I hope that when the film is released on DVD and Blu Ray we will get a chance to see the directors cut and I may even enjoy it more. This movie could very well be my personal favorite Marvel film and so far it is my favorite movie this year. I recommend that you watch Age of Ultron in the theatre and not a home because it is a great experience.",

That was extremely confusing, but more importantly, THERE IS A REASON HE'S CALLED MARVEL SUPERMAN. IT'S BASICALLY A COPY OF SUPERMAN, AND THEY DON'T HAVE THAT RIGHT, AS DC, THEIR RIVAL, MADE SUPERMAN. HE LOOKS LIKE SUPERMAN, WITH HIS CAPE, A BLUE BODY, RED AROUND, ETC.

There are other problems than confusion, but before I end with confusion, WHAT IS ULTRON? 2 of the villains turn to the heroes, which is, in my opinion, a terrible idea, and one of them dies in the stupidest way. I don't remember his name, but at least the movie actually said it, but I call him Marvel Flash. Because he's kind of the same thing, but not as close as Marvel Superman, fortunately. Either way, he runs in the way of bullets heading for a little boy and... I think it was Hawkeye. PROBLEM, he could easily push them out of the way with his speed! Then, the ending sucked.

It wasn't anything special, which is logical when you look at the big picture (this is, if you trust Marvel's calendar, a somewhat filler movie, made to lay out the events of the future movies, which should leave a deeper impact), but it was enough. The sequel is far more serious than the first installment, having certainly come out of the test phase, and it adds some depth to the whole franchise. This being said, one has to note that such an addition was not a problem and that the movie didn't lose any of it's original magic and awesomeness (yes, it is still a fun and awesome movie where RDJr. f*cks up and the rest of the team have to clean up after him!). Beside that, the movie gained much with the newly added characters - James Spader was absolutely fantastic providing the voice and character of Ultron (the guy was actually funny - creepy - but funny!), which is what I can say about Paul Bettany as Vision (yes, the guy actually picks up Thor's hammer!); adding other characters from the franchise (such as War Machine) was also a great move; and, finally, the Maximoffs, Pietro and Wanda, or Quicksliver and Scarlet Witch - amazing! Their genesis is great, Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen were brilliantly cast and their whole story was absolutely amazing (although they could've made it a little happier...). Also, what I liked is that they finally explained why Hawkeye is useful to the team (really, after seeing 'The Avangers', I've been wondering as to what that guy is doing there - I mean, Robin Hood, really?).",

The plot involves the Avengers who team up again to defeat Ultron, an A.I. that Tony Stark created hoping to protect the planet. But of Course, his plan goes awry as Ultron becomes self aware and plans to \"save the world\" by putting the human race and the Avengers to extinction. What I loved about this movie is how they put a unique twist on the \"take over the world\" cliche we've seen over and over again by using an A.I. that thinks he is just doing the right thing. Now, the great things about this movie are a. the action, b. the villian, c. the character development and d. the characters themselves. However, the major problem of this movie is the pacing. There are many parts that feel to slow and many parts that feel too fast. However, I was never bored with this movie. Avengers: Age of Ultron is extremely fun and a solid addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. 9/10",

Seriously, I think all they had to do was run, jump, and roll a few times while the CG artists created all the mayhem around them. They're the ones that should be walking away with millions. My other complaint is just with the DNA of the franchise itself, all the snarky remarks from Stark, and the little bits and quips from the others just cheapens the gravity of the situation. Similarly, with the need to save/evacuate that whole city. Is there something in the comic book domain that says the Innocent Public must be preserved at all costs?! This may have been laudable in the '40s/'50s but in this Age of Terrorism we KNOW this to be different and it just wreaks of quaint naivety which again cheapens the overall experience.

Nick fury should've had a little more screen time I wish, I liked the relationship development between black widow and the hulk as well. The final battle was pretty similar to the final battle in the last movie which kind of sucked but the cinematography made up for it. Overall, an exceptionally good avengers sequel!",

The problem with the entire Avengers series is too many characters and almost zero character development.  The writers are afraid to focus the plot on one or two of the heroes and develop deeper stories because they're bound to do fan service and equal screen time for all of them.  Instead of a story the audience can sink their teeth into, Ultron starts out with a CG fight scene and never lets up. Just one fight scene after another, each one trying to top the last.  It doesn't take long to get numb to all this and sort of tune it out.  Of course the heroes save the day and of course they set it up for the next film.  But the ride to get there is so bombastic and shallow I just waited for it to be over.",

Ultron didn't impress me for some reason as a super robot that is, and the guy he was building, ultra ultron was well, what was he? I thought ultrons face movements when speaking looked too much like plastic moving. Ultron wants to destroy mankind, why? we do enough of that already why not change us into a race of robots, I thought the premise was lame.

Director Joss Whedon focused too much on spectacle that he forgot to pay attention to the movie's narrative, which is hampered by too many introductions and exposition, feeling very overcrowded at times. However, the movie does have its character quirks and action set pieces that satisfy in every sense of the world.

Another problem in the movie is also Marvel's biggest weakness, Villains. Ultron, while brilliantly played by James Spader seemed like a threat at first but he and his army of disposable robots are defeated very easily even when some of our heroes only have a Bow and Arrow or Pistols. The film's story regresses as it goes on, taking breaks between plot progressions even when there is no action, trailer like scenes are inserted in the 2nd and 3rd acts to set up the next 4 of these movies and doing so just takes away the story of this movie and makes it seem like $330 million dollar preview of coming (and distant) attractions. Very sad time to go in a Marvel movie with expectations especially after the raising of the bar thanks to Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Guardians of the Galaxy, like i said this movie should have been a step forward in the franchise but it took 2 steps back instead.",

It's not a bad thing, But it can take away from the dramatic feel in some scenes or feel a little forced. The story is based around \"Ultron\" a AI Tony made to help save the world but didn't quite do what Tony wanted and makes life much more difficult for \"The Avengers\".

The movie brings the Avengers together again, with all of their disagreements and disgruntlements with one another--their antagonism produces some solid running gags, such as teasing Captain America for his reaction to swearing.  The premise of the movie is interesting, as they're now fighting a villain of Tony Stark's own creation, which tests the bonds between the Avengers.  We also see (finally) a Scarlett Johansson romance developing, but with the Hulk, as we simultaneously find out that her friendship with Hawkeye is just that.  Their just-friends status is confirmed by the discovery that Hawkeye has a comfortable nuclear family tucked away in a set of woods somewhere for their safety, which makes him a more complex character.",

The action is magnificent. The characters interact in a very funny and interesting way, and they all have a motivation for the most part. Being a little bit more specific here: Captain America is all of a sudden the coolest Avenger, going hand-to-hand against Ultron and pretty much kicking ass. Iron Man and Hulk have their moments, although not as many as I would have hoped. Hawkeye and Black Widow feel important enough and Thor... well, he's there too, and he's cool. Now, the Vision is probably the biggest attraction. He's visually astounding. And the twins are good enough to keep the film going on. Ultron is a really interesting villain, even though he could have been more menacing at times. But I do hate one thing: the editing. The pace of the movie is terrible at times and I hate that some scenes have no connection with anything. Regardless, Age of Ultron will probably end up being the least relevant Avengers film, but I think it's very, very solid and entertaining.",

But back to Avengers, this movie had amazing writing and actors behind it which came together to make a goofy but badass movie. I'm really glad the movie introduced the character Scarlet Witch because it gave an opportunity to go into the Avengers' psyches and see their relative backstories which helped you to identify the characters more and give them a personality more than just beating up bad guys. That said however this opens up a couple moments that try too hard to make you feel bad for the characters and make no sense. Like, the addition of Hawkeye's family just to force a backstory on us instead of letting it flow naturally like the others. Also, if you hate random love interests like I do, Hulk and Black Widow are a thing now. No real buildup or anything they're just...in love because every movie ever needs a love interest. But seriously other than that I have no quarrels with this movie. See it if you haven't already but just be prepared for one or two things that might bother you.",

In the film as in the comics, Ultron wants to destroy all human beings 3) In both the comics and the film, Ultron uses the Vision (Jarvis, in the film) to achieve his goal. My main point of criticism is the romance between the Black Widow and the Hulk. In order to make that plausible, Clint Barton has to present his family to the public and we discover that Natasha is his kid's \"Aunt\", so that gets rid of all former romance between the two. All that was pointless and a loss of time. The Black Widow should have tricked the Hulk to make him do whatever she intended him to do, just as she had tricked Loki the trickster, in the 1st film. That\u2019s her job, after all. Without that, she is useless.",

Whilst most of the dialogue between these characters remains engaging, much of it seems out of place and takes away from the tension.

This is an alright movie as movies go. It is pretty good as Marvel movies go. I have heard grumbling, but it\u2019s mostly nerds talking about things that can\u2019t possibly matter or people looking to pick a fight with some low-hanging fruit. Mostly what was disappointing was that the real conflict was the same as the first Avengers movie (will the Avengers assemble? Answer: yes) which was a letdown because the opening makes it seem like the writers have finally moved on and that we can stop rehashing the plotline that is already destined for rehashing in Civil War. For a moment Whedon makes it seem like this tired emotional territory will be made anew by Hawkeye stepping forward as the hearth of the team but then he just remains in the role of underutilized acting talent while the camera lingers on him without explanation. Also, remember when Tony Stark died for a second in the first Avengers and even though you knew his contract said he had to be fine you still cared because it completed the only interesting character arc in the Marvel movies wherein a guy with no real powers and crippling narcissism changes from being a person to a Jesus? Verily he has risen, which is fine because there\u2019s a whole other sequel where the event leaves him psychologically damaged and he must continue to evolve. You will not have that experience watching anyone die or not die in this movie.",

This combination of beautifully grounded character detail, philosophies and crazy action makes it a hell of a roller coaster. But does it just collapse under it's own weight? Some think so, but I disagree. Whilst it does jump around, you get enough time at each point to get really involved, and the story's writing even lends itself to the jumpy nature, each scene beautifully setting up the next. It flows. And that's largely down to Whedon.",

What the writer-director saw in the plum gig, beyond presumed bags of money, was a chance to adopt another of his dysfunctional surrogate families.

I think part of the reason why people have started to give this movie a lot of flak is the fact that it didn't surpass everyone's expectations but I think that it was a great movie for what it is. I do agree that the wow factor is not as strong and it is not as groundbreaking as the previous film but it is still a major blockbuster that excels at what it does. The Avengers are pushed to their limits in this one as they are torn apart mentally after the fight in Wakanda. Each Character felt like they have changed as a result of what happens in this story. The Hulk is now more of a loner than he was before and Black Widow has finally revealed part of her past. I personally have some mixed feelings about her portrayal in this film though because she is capable and she has more depth with her relationship with the Hulk. However she was captured pretty easily and the fact  that she sees herself as a monster by having to go through the sterilization process sends a questionable message. With all of those problems though the film still has great set pieces and funny one liners. The best part of the film was when the Avengers were at a party and interacted with one another. I actually would have been satisfied if they had spent the whole movie at this party. The new characters that were introduced are actually compelling in their own right. This version of quicksilver may not be as funny as his fox counterpart but he still has a few moments to shine. The Scarlet Which has an interesting power by bending reality and mind control and is torn between her loyalties between her brother and Ultron. It was an interesting move to make Jarvis the vision but it was a move that pulled off pretty well. The seeds of the future conflict between Iron Man and Captain America are sown as they bicker over the need of creating Ultron and the fact that Stark was pretty backstabbing in this film. Hawkeye was given a lot more depth than any of his previous incarnations since he is given a motivation to continue fighting for his family. He is also an important father figure to Scarlet Which after the death of her brother and gives an inspirational speech. The heroes is this film actually act as heroes unlike their counterparts in the DC Cinematic Universe as they make attempts to evacuate civilians from the carnage. The biggest thing that this film does right is Ultron himself. He is both intimating and funny at the same time. Some viewed him as a weak villain because of the fact that he ha been pummeled by the heores but people forget that he is a computer program that can spread his consciousness to other machines. This film turned one of my least favorite Marvel villains and made him into one of my personal favorites. He may be a machine but he also breaks expectations by having a sarcastic sense of humor and is genuinely disappointed when the siblings turn on him. This film is not a ground-breaking as its predecessor but it is still a great film in its own right..",

This though - Ultron has to be the worst villain in MCUs history and that's really saying something. The way the story is set up is just horrible The sojourn to South Africa is eye-rolling. And the action just looks completely phoney all the way through. 1 point for Jeremey Renner.",
