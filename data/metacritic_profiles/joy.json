      "text": "Joy has a lot going for it that ultimately makes me like it more than not, but it is undeniable that this is a deeply flawed film. For starters, Jennifer Lawrence and the entire cast is phenomenal. Many claim Lawrence did not deserve her Academy Award nomination, but my God did she ever. She was stupendous. Not my favorite performance of the year, but certainly up there. Bradley Cooper and Robert De Niro were also quite good. Additionally, the pacing was fine, the film was always captivating, and the story had some very good comedic moments that had the whole theater in stitches. However, that is about where it ends. Yes, Lawrence's acting is good enough to outweigh everything else, namely the story. The story and the way it was written is deeply flawed. Based on a real woman, I have to assume the real story could not have been that bad that they had to Hollywoodize everything. Not only does Joy's story follow the traditional character arc and story structure a little too well, it just feels so fake. Even more, much of it designed to remind you of how strong a woman Joy is. I get that she is strong and independent, but I do not need a reminder every five seconds. I have no issue with strong women, but a film about one does not need to keep reminding you of such. Instead, it should demonstrate it. However, this is a sin the film commits quite often, as it often tells rather than shows, namely in the form of its narration. Entirely useless, the narration here is a major cop-out and is used solely to have forced exposition and connect scenes together. The script finds ways to get worse, however, as all of the characters are one-dimensional. Real humans do not act this way, let alone ones allegedly based on real ones. In particular, Joy's half-sister seemed to cruel and mean, yet there has to be more to her tale than the film let on. Ultimately, Joy is compelling, funny, and incredibly well-acted by Jennifer Lawrence, but its story handicaps it throughout.",

      "text": "Jennifer Lawrence made a name for herself by starring in The Hunger Games, and she's easily one of the most recognizable actresses in Hollywood. But what does she do now that The Hunger Games has ended? Her first post-HG project is reteaming with David O. Russell, director of Silver Linings Playbook and American Hussle, which netted her one Academy Award win and two nominations (including Joy). Although Joy wasn't as well-received as their other pairings, it still gives Jennifer Lawrence a movie to carry on her own without a franchise title to support her. Joy is a biographical film about the life of Joy Mangano, the inventor of the Miracle Mop, because evidently she needed a biopic. She grew up in a home where everyone around her had a dead-end job, and her grandmother was the only source of optimism for Joy. By the time she's 30, Joy is a divorced mother of two, working a dead-end job, her parents are divorced but still live with Joy, and her ex-husband lives in her basement. To add insult to injury, her sister constantly humiliates Joy in front of her children. The rest of the film is Joy overcoming these obstacles to become an overnight success with her first invention, the Miracle Mop, and selling the product on QVC. It is one of those inspirational bio-dramas we get a few times a year, but it never feels overly sappy or fake. The real issue is the film's first half which drug on about 20 minutes too long hammering in how much the characters' lives suck. Once Joy makes the prototype for the Miracle Mop and starts her business, the movie's quality picks up immensly. You actually start caring about the characters rather than just saying \"Wow, their lives suck.\" The ensemble cast, which includes Lawrence, Bradley Cooper and Robert De Niro, does typically great work and salvages the movie's slower parts. Joy is definitely one of those movies that you really go see for the cast, but it's often fun to watch Joy's race to the top even if it takes a long time for her to start.",

Russell's best film, but this is not terrible despite it's bland,  but Russell's style is vigorous and Jennifer Lawrence's performance is peppy, together their craftsmanship is splendiferous. Originally Annie Mumolo (\"Bridesmaids\") wrote the screenplay in 2013, so Russell signed on to direct also he selected to write the script, he didn't re-write the script, he wrote his own screenplay and Mumolo got the story credit and produced the film, for Russell got the soul screenwriting credit. Here's a fact for ya!: Kirsten Wiig almost starred in the film as \"Joy\" but Lawrence took her place. Jennifer Lawrence stars as Joy Mangano she is the only sensible person in the family, so she's been running around the household most of her life. Things are now complicated, her father Rudy (Robert De Niro) moves backs in to her house after his second marriage has failed, her mom Terry (Virginia Madsen) who is obsessed over soap-operas and watches TV non stop. Joy's ex husband Tony (Edgar Ramirez) lives in the basement pursuing his favorite dream about being a musician, Joy's sister (Dascha  Polanco) who undermines everything she does. Joy's grandma Mimi (Diane Ladd) who's the only one who has confidence in her. Joy has an inspiration for a mop getting it on the market, so she captures the attention of Neil (Bradley Cooper), who runs a brand shopping network called QVC. Tony and her childhood friend Peggy (Elizabeth Rohm) believe in her. Dad's new girlfriend (Isabella Rossellini) invents in her mop, no one thinks she'll achieve any success. Lawrence is wonderful not only she has the star-making is great but so do the chemistry that she, Cooper, De Niro and O.Russell have together, this is the \"Silver-Lining Playbook\" team's third collaboration together, they all love each other on set you could also tell by Lawrence saying about director David O.Russell  \"I want us to be buried next to each other, I really do.\" O.Russell's script is bland, but I am wowed by Russell's style also Linus Sandgren's cinematography not to mention Lawrence's star-making and charisma. I also thought that the film shouldn't win best picture, but it's really a good film. Grade A",

I've been bored this year by film, there's a few I have yet to see but Joy is atop the ranks of one of my favourite movie experiences I've had this decade.

The real strong side of Joy is the great performance by Jennifer Lawrence. I totally understand the Golden Globe nomination.

Now the main issue with the rest of the cast is that they aren't very likeable. Robert Di Niro and Bradley Cooper are both in this film but sadly they are almost unlikeable.

      "text": "Joy as the new movie of David O. Russell stays far behind from his previous features. The major topic that treats is basically the same, it\u2019s a lost protagonist defeated by life, with a family behinds trying to control him and, of course, living throw him too. All these set in the slums, because is from the director\u2019s belief that those environments bring out the worse of all people in order to survive. And the parade starts with Joy Mangano, a single mother, with an inventor mind that carries with a parasite family, sucking her life that won\u2019t stop until there\u2019s nothing left. She is accompanied by a mother stuck watching an endless soap opera, all day long; a failed father with anger and trust issues; an immature ex-husband that lives in her basement; and a jealous sister with nothing to lose. The problems of the film begins when that family is moved aside in the story and we see nothing but the protagonist fighting for her dreams, although is impressive the real struggle of Mangano, seeming like a melodrama; the seal of this director is how he manage to have a big group of people floating around a person trying to move on. That\u2019s when the viewer notices the power of the family and its deepest thoughts that scares you and makes you feel trapped. David O. Russell is marvelous directing actors, Jennifer Lawrence certainly captures the director idea for her performances and the family is, ones again, well achieved.",

Once the mop comes into the film though, the movie begins to take off. From that point on the movie is almost never less than solid and occasionally more. You really do root for Joy to succeed and become frustrated at the obstacles set in her way. Lawrence gives a decently engaging performance ,although it's not her career best in my opinion. It's not nearly as consistent as American Hustle or Silver Linings Playbook which were both invigorating their entire runtimes and some of the best movies of the past decade but it's still worth watching if you accept that it takes a while to cohere into an interesting story.",

Bradley Cooper is like in almost every Jennifer Lawrence drama movie but in this film, he did a really good job and I actually understood his part in the film. It's based on a true story so it might be boring plot wise, but I was entertainined at some of the scenes. I felt the director did a very great job especially in the scenes in where there was silence and Joy was angry because I could feel some of the tension. Solid movie that has a powerful message.
