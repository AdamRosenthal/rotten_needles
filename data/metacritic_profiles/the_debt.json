Most of the film is about the three young actors that play them 30 years ago.  They go to communist East Germany to capture a former Concentration Camp torturer so they can take him back to Israel for trials for his misdeeds, but they bungle the kidnapping.  I thought the film was well acted and it held my attention the entire time.  The only problem I had was that the older actors looked NOTHING like they younger ones with the exception of Helen Mirren.  They should have found actors that at least looked similar to each other.  Some of this film is not easy to watch, particularily the Gynecologist scenes so be prepared.  It deserves its R rating.",

      "text": "Lacks decantation. I found The Debt to be a good movie with a huge potential, which was not fully used. Despite having good story, an interesting, flashback-based storytelling, some good spy action, and -- last but not least -- some good -- alas, not epically memorable -- scenes of psychological confrontation of the Nazi criminal with the Mossad agents, The Debt has some flaws, such as a bit floppy romance story and the lack of historical background when presenting Dietrich Vogel, which at some point make of this movie more of a chase after an older man with than a chase after a terrible war criminal. In other words, The Debt is a raw gem that could have been polished more.",

I am also not totally sure where the title comes from...I guess I will figure that out some day....  The scene at the railroad station was harrowing and could have been in any **** flick.  One reviewer suggested that the narrative could have done in parallel with the 60s played against the 90s.  Also, I think a reference to the capture and trial of Eichmann would have lent some historic credibility and grounding to the movie...  All that being said, it was a fascinating one to watch...",

And Jesper Christensen's portrayal of the antagonist Dieter Vogel. Not the best film ever made, but not the worst. Forgettable but also a good role for Chastain.",

      "text": "An average plot that ends with the usual good vs bad, with good conscious prevailing. The acting should be better with who they've cast however its hard not to notice the distinct Australian accent in Sam Worthington's Younger David, who is supposed to be Jewish. Not to mention he looks nothing like Ciar\u00c3\u00a1n Hinds who plays Older David. David as a character was selfish and emotionally convoluted and actually cheapens the impact of the film. The pace of the movie was to slow to get to its interesting point showing unoriginal subpar directing. The action filled scenes won't put you to sleep but they aren't great either. Rent or download, not worth the price of a cinema ticket.",

In addition, the film is quite compelling and thrilling at times, which is ultimately what you want from a film of this type. However, it is really poorly written and poorly told. The plot seems all over the place and keeps jumping back-and-forth between the present and past, while not being entirely clear on why things are happening, which is annoying. Though I don't need things spelled out for me, some help would have been appreciated. Ultimately, this one's plot was its downfall, which is too bad, because it had the potential to be a really good film with a cast of this quality.",
