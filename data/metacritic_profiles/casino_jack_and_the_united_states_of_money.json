      "text": "Truth is indeed stranger than fiction.  This movie is a tall tale so unbelievable it takes seeing the players tell you their role in living color to make it undeniably true.  And that's what Gibney et. al. deliver with this film.  The story is awesome, in the true sense of the word.  Though it's so jaw-dropping it leaves the viewer feeling worn out, and is hardly uplifting, it's time well spent.  If you care about the world, this will help you understand and realize the importance of political roadblocks to a better future, and might leave you more clear on what you can do, so you don't spin your wheels doing something that this movie teaches/suggests will likely be ineffective, but rather, perhaps give you the focus and courage to act in an effective way.  If you don't care about making the world a better place, don't bother watching this.   Find some escapist entertainment.",
