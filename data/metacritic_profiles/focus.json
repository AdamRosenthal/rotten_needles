The opening in New Orleans is energetic and slick, the pacing is brisk, and the comedy and action is deftly and effectively mixed. The second half, however, jarringly ventures into thriller territory the film is neither confident nor comfortable in navigating. There are glimmers of brilliance - B.D. Wong's cameo, a scene in a car with a methodical assassin - but the end result of the film is muddled, with far too many twists, loose ends, and anticlimaxes. Will Smith more than has the requisite charisma for a part such as this, but the film is beneath him and he seems aware of this throughout, which detracts from his performance. Meanwhile, Margot Robbie (who was excellent in \"The Wolf of Wall Street\") is awkward in an underwritten role, which is more the scriptwriters' faults than hers. Furthermore, the two seem mismatched and have little-to-no discernible chemistry. This is a misshapen, confused, weak, and generic disappointment of a film which doesn't do justice to its stars or accomplished beginning.",

The central component of the whole story is the love plot between Will Smith and Margot Robbie, but their relationship wasn't given enough foundation to make it a compelling romance.

Truly, this one is incredibly sleek and sexy as a thriller, but also manages to have enough humor and quality one-liners to make it passable as a comedy. When watching Focus, however, it is hard to take your eyes off of Margot Robbie, who really knocks this role out of the park, as does Will Smith. Without their coolness and charisma in the lead roles, Focus would be a far lesser film and they really exude the right type of personality to convince you of damn near anything, as conmen should.

The movie doesn't allow you to place your trust in either of the characters, making it a little difficult to relate to them through the bulk of the movie.

Will Smith plays Nicky a con-artist (just like in Hitch) takes Jess (the stunning Margot Robbie) under his wing, shows her the tricks of the trade, they both have a love interest with one another, when Jess gets uncomfortably close, Nicky ends their relationship. Three years later, Nicky is in Buenos Aires, working on a dangerous scheme when Jess unexpectedly shows up she is now a skilled professional femme fatal, making Nick's plans messed up. She throws Nicky for a loop of time at a time when he cannot afford to be off his game. Yes this film has it's problems lacking a sharp-script, but Glenn Ficarra and John Requa's script is filled with intriguing set-pieces, every single character is so appealing. One of the best funniest things in the film is Adrian Martinez who play Nicky's friend also associate who has some funny one liners. Not to mention Gerald McRaney is fantastic also is equally good. It's one of the best films that is both a rom-com/thriller. 4.5 out of 5 stars",

The problem with the movie is that it doesn't have a interesting plot or characters. I didn't really know what the film wants me to understand. Just watch it once but after that stay far away",
