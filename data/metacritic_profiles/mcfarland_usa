As a Mexican-American, I have had to watch countless movies with which I've never experienced any personal connection. McFarland USA is a standout on this factor. For example, I most definitely enjoyed the subtle humor within this film, often times knowing the joke because of my own experience with some awkward moments during culture clashes, other various cultural undertones as well as the Mexican based, Spanish language. This is one of only a handful of movies I've ever seen to use these factors and I applaud both Costner and Disney for their work. I hope that now that Latinos are the largest segment of California's population, more films such as McFarland USA will be made. I would think for example, the exact same cast could be used to re-do an old James Cagney film \"Angels with Dirty Faces\", obviously, now re-set in L.A., but with the same young men. There are so many stories that could be told about Latinos that I think will uplift and inspire (why Cinco De Mayo is critical to U.S. history, who led the charge at Omaha beach and on and on). I hope people will see McFarland, USA, not only for the inspiring film about the underdog, but for what it could mean for the future.",

When he discovers how tough and fast the students are, he forms a cross country track team. Usually, each team member has a personality, but this one only revolves around 2. It's also missing any humor, which would have added warmth. The only thing that sets this one apart is the focus on the Latino culture. Even though it is earnest (and based on a true story), it hits all of the clich\u00e9s.",

This is a movie that clearly wants to be Field Of Dreams, but doesn't have the balls to be it. There are painfully injected jokes and tear jerking moments included for attention. But this movie really looks good and has solid performances, but really it is turd, polished and scamming you for a movie that is uplifting.",

The other thing that really makes the movie still work despite the fact that you know where it's headed is the mood and texture of it.  It never feels contrived or forced, it allows in different shades of emotion besides \"woo hoo!\" which it does very well too, and that makes a huge difference.",

Race is a common theme of the film much like other Disney sports films like Million Dollar Arm and Remember the Titans. Disney tends to follow a similar format for their sports movies and McFarland USA is no exception but Costner is so loveable in the league and it is hard not to become a sucker for that underdog story. Although it will likely not be the best film you ever see, McFarland USA will certainly but a smile on your face.",
