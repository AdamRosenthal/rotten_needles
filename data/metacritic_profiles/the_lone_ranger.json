The fact it tries to cover both and more leads to confusion. The lead performances are not great. Armie Hammer lacks presence and comic sensibility as the Lone Ranger, whereas Johnny Depp is unintelligible as a mumbling, halting version of Jack Sparrow. However, the support cast, in particular Tom Wilkinson and Helena Bonham-Carter, are good.

We took our 3 boys, aged 9, 13, and 14 to see this movie and for a change, all of them enjoyed it. Not easy to find a film that appeals to this range of ages. I also loved this movie and will willingly see it again. Very good story, excellent acting, and worth the price of admission. I am glad though, that it's not in 3D, which is becoming a gimmick when used in films that don't need that to be visually stimulating. This film is has stunning visuals of Monument Valley. Another of the things that amazed me the most were not the explosions or the finely executed train sequences, but the amazing make up done on all the actors, from Johnny Depp's \"Tonto\" face paint to William Fichtner's \"Butch Cavendish\" split lip and stringy hair to Helena Bonham Carter's \"Red\" and her ivory leg (it's been in trailers, so not a spoiler, I think). This is not a comedy, nor is it a \"dram-edy\", but all around entertaining. The thing I noticed most about Depp's performance was that there was nothing he did that reminded me of Captain Jack in his mannerisms and I have watched the first 3 Pirate movies many times with my kids. Sure, there are nods to Pirates and even a few of Johnny's other movies if you catch the references. I caught a couple of them. As always, Depp gives a fabulous performance and I think his new Comanche family is proud of his portrayal. Tonto, though damaged, is first and foremost a warrior and is the smart one of the duo. That crow became less of a distraction as well. It wasn't just a headpiece. I also can't say enough good things about the 6'3\" Armie Hammer who plays the title character. He's perfect and a good straight man to Depp's sometimes mischievous Tonto. I didn't find any of the humor to be dumbed-down or just for cheap laughs. Nice to watch a film with out any fart jokes.",

This film is garnering a lot of hate which is quite ridiculous, as I found it to be typical summer movie fun, that doesn't quite live up to the standards of Pirates. There are two main limps that drag the film down. Its runtime, and the plot. The movie should really be about 30-45 minutes shorter, but that's a lesser complaint. The real problem is how tonally inconsistent the plot is. There will be moments when the villain cuts organs out of deceased bodies, and then immediately after there is humor from Tonto. It feels like the Lone Ranger and Tonto are in one movie, and this evil, menacing villain is in another. Also, this is surprisingly dark for a Disney movie. The villain is scary and cuts out and eats people's hearts,(brought to you by Disney, ha ha!) and even though it's being marketed as one, it isn't a family friendly movie. I went with my 7 year old brother and he could handle it, but he's got balls of steel so read reviews before taking your kids. Despite all my gripes, I found the Lone Ranger to be engaging summer fare that was just a bit too long.",

      "text": "Much like with his first Pirates of the Caribbean film, Gore Verbinski has roved that he is a master of both spectacle and story as The Lone Ranger is an unconventional yet exhilarating tale of reinvention and revenge. While returning home John Reid (Armie Hammer) meets Tonto (Johnny Depp) during a daring train jailbreak. When John is left for dead Tonto saves him and encourages him to become something outside the law, to become a Lone Ranger. Much like Verbinski's previous effort Rango, The Lone Ranger is a twist on the conventional western and doesn't quite feel like a western at all. The Lone Ranger feels like a remarkably smart kids film as almost everything in the film happens for the sake of comedy as the film rockets along with a light hearted tone. However the film does have some disturbing moments that give John and Tonto their justifications for their vendetta meaning there are moments when the film doesn't feel like a 12A at all but a 15 meaning there are moments that may not be suitable for children, especially a rather twisted torture scene early on in the film. It's a courageous film that goes against the stereotypical western formula to become its own beast, a fast paced revenge thriller that boasts more comedy than the average buddy comedy and still has room for exploding trains, gunfights and romance. A film that is trying to be spectacular and look incredible and despite a slow opening it pretty much achieves everything it sets out to do and more.",

Armie Hammer never became his role and at times was very awkward to watch, Jonny Depp acted well in his role of Jack Sparrow in a native american costume, but ultimately their chemistry fell face flat. The entire story is told to a little kid similarly to Princess Bride, but this format quickly becomes strange and feels very out-of-place.

This movie takes its time developing, but it has wonderful light moments (and there are plenty of them) and some serious moments too and balances them beautifully. If you're looking for lots and lots of jumpy action shots; lots of vroom vroom bang bang boom (car chases, shootouts and explosions), you get them here, but without the jumpiness, and every single one serves the plot. Depp and Hammer are great as are all the villains, and the story builds nicely to a wonderful nostalgic climax. A little slow in spots? Maybe. Some aberrant vampire bunnies? OK. But how director Gore Verbinski, the writers and editors got this one past the money men is probably a story in itself. The cinematography is gorgeous and every shot, (except for the bunnies), and every bit of spectacle serves the story. I can't remember the last time a big Hollywood movie cared about story, or characters for that matter. The only thing at fault here is the marketing campaign which gives the impression the movie is one big heartless yuck. Well it's not. And don't hold that against it. Don't let this movie die!

I have seen the Ranger two times by now and what still surprises me is this unexpected, almost involuntary delight that filled me as soon as the movie started and made me smile all the way through until the very end, on the one hand, and mass demonization of a great movie by each one of those 13.5 constipated critics, on the other hand. I can understand if you didn't like a complex message of the movie, a different image of your idol heroes, violent undertones of the background story, too much conversation vs non-stop action that we come to expect after seeing all those never ending super-action flicks, even if you secretly never liked Johhny Depp after all, but COME ON! Looking at the critics ratings on this site including, you might think it's the worst movie among those listed... Let me tell you that I HAVE seen almost all of those and in my opinion only a couple of them come close to the level of quality Ranger has. I'll tell you why. 1) Ranger was made by a talented team of Verbinski, Depp and the crew who publicly admitted it was not just one of those sequels they were aiming to produce.  It was an important and challenging job for all of them and they invested their talent, skills and vision into the movie on the level  they had not done for a long time. It clearly shows and powers the spiritual strength of the movie's magic atmosphere that grabs you tight and carries you through the movie making you an emotional participant in every piece of action. Audiences get so drawn in, that they talk to the characters aloud, cry out in joy and despair and regularly applaud Tinto, Ranger, Silver and hiss at Butch. Apart from kid's movies, I could not remember ever seeing such a reaction from the audience. That in itself is a characteristic of an authentic piece of art. 2) It is one of the most beautiful, heartfelt, sad, funny, smart, disconcerting, train crashing and mind-blowing movies this year. When did you see such an impossible combination last? How on earth did they do that, all I want to know. 3) It's a new look at the genre of a western, you might even say Verbinksi and Depp created a new genre, a western with multi-layered contents, funny characters and jaw dropping action scenes. As far as I could understand this is what the so-called critics found especially irritating. An unusual combination, but since when has a new take on the old model become an artistic weakness, not a strength? It works wonderfully and leaves you just amazed by the scope of the design and implementation skill.  3) It's a device of intellectual depth but it does not feel intellectual. It feels popcorn, easy-going, laugh- out-loud and gasp at the action entertainment. Which it certainly is. God bless the creators for such a unique movie going experience. Under-appreciated or not, a good movie never gets forgotten by the grateful spectators!!",

      "text": "Disney\u2019s The Lone Ranger follows the origins of the masked rider, John Reid (Armie Hammer), and the events that lead him to become a symbol of justice in the Old West. After completing a law degree, Reid returns to his hometown, Colby, Texas, to become the city\u2019s government prosecutor and hold criminals accountable under United States law (along with a firm commitment to John Locke\u2019s \u201cTwo Treatises of Government\u201d). However, when his brother, Dan (James Badge Dale), is murdered in cold blood by ruthless outlaw Butch Cavendish (William Fichtner) Reid realizes that some criminals operate above of the law and he turns to a different form of justice as a masked vigilante. As a tenuous peace between the Native American tribes and white settlers is threatened, the Lone Ranger must join forces with a heroic, though slightly offbeat, Comanche warrior, Tonto (Johnny Depp), who has spent years hunting Cavendish. Together, Reid and Tonto set out on a mission to investigate the circumstances that led to Dan\u2019s death before more blood is spilled. In an effort to re-imagine the Lone Ranger as a modern blockbuster franchise, Disney turned to the team behind their highly-successful Pirates of the Caribbean series, including producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Gore Verbinski, along with star Johnny Depp. Unfortunately, despite a number of strong individual components, the final Lone Ranger movie experience misses the bar (and longterm promise) established in the first Pirates of the Caribbean installment. For many audience members, Verbinski\u2019s latest will likely succeed in delivering mindless summer entertainment with a number of humorous character moments, a quirky (albeit familiar) performance from Depp, and an elaborate third act set-piece. Yet, for all of the film\u2019s successes, most of the core story arcs and action beats are either derivative or underwhelming  misguided in attempts to piece together a blockbuster experience out of well-known parts. A flawed but often entertaining summer blockbuster experience, The Lone Ranger falls short as a sum of its promising individual parts. Unfortunately, the mixture of two likable leads and a cast of accomplished character actors, backed by highly-successful producers and a $200 million budget, based on a well-known pair of American heroes, doesn\u2019t necessarily deliver a quality moviegoing experience. No doubt, certain audience members will thoroughly enjoy the bangs and gags in this Lone Ranger story but it\u2019s still style over substance at nearly every turn, and fails to evolve or elevate the series canon in any meaningful (or particularly exciting) way.",

The plot was predictable from the get-go. The love interest barely more than a required female role so they could say they had a woman in the movie. At the end, the Lone Ranger tells Rebecca, \"I can't stay.\"  Guess what her reply is?   \"I know\"    Really? Can't she say, \"What do you mean you're leaving me, a widow with a 9 year old kid alone here in the desert with all these disreputable men just waiting to find me alone?!!\"  One scene, Rebecca (Ruth Wilson) is working on a fence with a ranch hand; her son who is at least 9 years old, is playing in the river with the dog. In 1869, that kid would be fully employed working his butt off on the fence!  The complete lack of any attention to details makes it clear this entire movie was just an afterthought and that the people making could care less what worthless cr---p they foist off on the movie going public.

It's almost the same problem as \"Man of Steel\" does and this movie is way too dark, way too broad, and way too underwhelm. The story takes place I 1869 where we meet John Reid (Armie Hammer) is visiting to see his brother and his wife at Texas, until he meets bad outlaws to capture Butch Cavendish from prisoner and he meets a local Indian warrior named Tonto (Johnny Depp). So he and his brother must find bad outlaws in the desert, until his brother and his men where dead. Reid was saved from Tonto to bring back alive and he teams up with Tonto to face bad outlaws from justice, so he wears a black mask and becomes \"The Lone Ranger.\" We've seen too much Johnny Depp's performance like his face expressions and other roles he's been done lately, but Johnny Depp is miscast as Tonto. Tonto is the same formula as that they borrowed from Jack Sparrow roles like he done in Pirates of the Caribbean series. Depp turns very ugly and acting like a Indian stereotypical of Tim Burton's Indian Zombie and I guess that the creators want Johnny Depp to play a weak supporting role. Armie Hammer is alright in his role, but not very memorable because they forgot to stay focus on the character instead of Johnny Depp and they shouldn't just called \"The Lone Ranger and His Tonto.\" That's what is all about, The Lone Ranger is based on the classic TV series and comes along with his adventures. The characters are recycled from Pirates of the Caribbean stereotypes and also the villains are so forgettable. Not only that, the movie is also too bloody and too dark for a Disney action flick, I don't if the movie makes it promise to the audience and there's couple of scenes where they get killed, shot, and murdered in each battle scenes. There's one scene where the train gets switch into a next rail or next train is pretty entertaining that takes only 10 or 12 minutes in the final act. Outside of that, this movie is pretty weak and we're watching the same formula like the first Pirates of the Caribbean does and they shouldn't call it \"Cowboys of the Dessertain.\" Thumbs Down.",

I am normally not hard on movies but considering myself a serious movie buff, I am completely appalled.

Another movie, also a western, that moved the needle way over to comedy was \"Wild Wild West\" (1999), which was criticized for many of the same reasons.  More troubling for \"The Lone Ranger\" is that Tonto, the most serious and taciturn character in the original Long Ranger legend, is now the main protagonist and jokester.  And on top of that is the magical conversation between an ancient Tonto and a child, which arguably was dispensable to the plot.  All of this is not what the audience expected.

The constant back and forth between Tonto\u2019s (Johnny Depp's character) retelling of the tale of the Lone Ranger to a precocious boy, always drew us out of the main story line. Johnny Depp's heavy makeup and oddball shtick is getting tired now; and the chemistry with Army Hammer\u2019s Lone Ranger fell flat. As we've seen with the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, Gore Verbinski is no stranger to staging elaborate action sequences; but here, the action feels even more implausible and spans for way too long. This brings to the length of this movie, which has no business being 150 minutes! A leaner runtime and tighter narrative would have definitely lightened my eyelids. The only thing I truly admired about 'The Lone Ranger' was the quality of the production value. The character-centric costumes, production designs and sound designs gave it a top-notch quality that you've come to expect from big budget studio films such as this.

Gore Verbinski's take on such a figure seems more or less inclined to flip the coin. This is hardly surprising, Johnny Depp, in a supporting role? Horsehockey! The man can immerse himself into any role. He very well could have played the Lone Ranger (despite his age), but appears more suited in out of the ordinary characters like Tonto. I am sure some people will find it offensive that a white man portrays an Indian (it has been done before). Even so, Depp brings a fresh breath in his performance as Tonto.

      "text": "This movie is a tribute to childhood afternoons spent watching westerns, and then playing outside with cap guns and cowboy hats, and as such I think it succeeds perfectly.  I think that it perfectly captures the spirit of those old cowboy shows, while being smart enough to also poke a bit of fun at them, but earnest enough to also capture that childhood magic. You can fully expect a six-shot revolver to never run out of bullets until it is dramatically convenient for it to do so, a faithful horse that will magically appear at just the right place and time when its needed (um, even if that means showing up \"Santa Claus style\"),villains with the blackest of hearts, and at least one overly gratuitous exploration of the \"ricochet\" concept. If you're looking for a \"grown up\", \"mature\" re-telling of \"The Lone Ranger\" then forget it; this is a celebration of childhood, of everything that was great and awful in those old cowboy shows. So put your cynical, grown-up, critic goggles away, grab a bag of peanuts, and just enjoy the show!",

      "text": "I sat down to watch this movie and said \"ok let's see why the critics gave this movie such bad reviews\" and at the end, I still didn't know why it got ripped apart. This movie is fantastic. The story is gripping and provides a lot of depth. Disney utilizes the 2.5hrs the way they should be. If this movie was an hour shorter, it would feel like a rushed and muddled mess but it takes it's time and at no points in this movie did I say \"this is boring\". I am a sucker for movies with well written stories and this one delivers. Every actor and actress is perfect for their role and the story doesn't take a back seat to a shoehorned in love story (which is always refreshing). The only reason I give this a 9 instead of 10 is because I think it would have been marginally better if the kid in the fair thing wasn't in there but The Lone Ranger in no way is a bad movie.",

      "text": "Gore Verbinski's 'The Lone Ranger' is one of the most overlooked and under rated movies to come out in the past few years. Armie Hammer is memorable as the titular character, who evolves from a mild mannered city lawyer to a rogue dispenser of western justice aided by a Native American outcast. Tonto, a character that Johnny Depp makes into his own, is also a refreshing satire on the \"Noble Savage\". I would also say Depp's controversial performance as Tonto is much more nuanced to counter Quentin Tarantino's more cynically written, blaxploitation-inspired characters in films like 'Django Unchained' & \"Hateful Eight\". But while Quentin took inspiration from the drive-in classics of the Grindhouse era for his western themed films, Director Gore Verbinski attempts to emote the brisk, adventuresome, zest of Sergio Leon's \"Duck You Sucker!\"  while also infusing it with the modern novelties of a big budget and big effects. \"The Lone Ranger\" is both a wonderful homage to the western genre as well as a genuinely entertaining tale of the Wild West itself.",
