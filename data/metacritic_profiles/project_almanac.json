Send themselves despite many failed experiments that proved how dangerous the attempt is to make. And what do they do with the time travel?

I could agree with others about the love story in the movie, but it wasn't a bad story. Just not a lot work put into it. What the kids did with the time machine was expected and predictable. Kids try to cheat the system and have a wonderful time partying. What can you expect? They are just mere high school kids.

A normal person watched this and thinks the whole problem is over.  However, this creates a time paradox.  With the time machine destroyed before the protagonist can discover it, the protagonist never finds the time machine.  With him never finding the time machine, he never goes back in time to destroy the time machine.
