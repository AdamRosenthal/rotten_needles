Cameron Diaz is essentially the lead character in the film but Leslie Mann carries the film from a humor standpoint. Her nonsensical style is a delight and never gets boring or aggravating. Diaz's character has the bulk of the depth and she delivers as needed while Kate Upton provides the stereotypical ditzy blonde with big boobs but does so while maintaining a sort of sweet and innocently stupid charisma. Honestly, my only real negatives with the film were the decision to cast Nicki Minaj as a sort of comedic relief character and the underutilization of Upton's character. Minaj annoys you every brief moment she's on screen and Upton often times feels out of place; almost as if she was thrown on screen simply as eye candy, even though the film's target audience is women. Nonetheless, this is a surprisingly great movie that most women (and I think plenty of men) will enjoy.",

Mark is an arrogant self centered Venture Capitalist who feels entitled and has little regard for others. And the best part is that at the end of the movie Mark gets his comeuppances and even gets punched out by Don Johnson. Sound familiar Mitt? Remember when your son Tagg said he would have liked to punch out President Obama.",

      "text": "The Other Woman starts as an intelligent revenge comedy with a talented cast and great concept yet fails to deliver anything worth remembering. To be quite frank the story is atrocious. The concept shows promise and initially the film delivers that but it seems as if the writer ran out of ideas after the hour mark and felt the need to have a two hour film. The quality of the jokes dropped severely with the story becoming an incoherent mess in order to arrive at the very forced climax.",

The best part of this movie is seeing Jaime Lannister walking into a glass door.",

      "text": "the film The Other Woman is basically insulting woman but it's a charmer; cameron diaz plays  a successful lawyer and loves her boyfriend Nick. Then she goes to his house as a  plummer pretending to fix his bathroom, then she finds out Nick has a wife  which played by Leslie Mann then they be friends and then another mistress an turns out it's a dumb blond who is kate upton! then the revenge gets started. This movie is laughable ( but sometimes gets lost with it's comedy) and why is the director of 'My Sister's Keeper\" directing the parody of how woman get cheated on? but this movie is funny the cast is good i love this movie it's romantic/sweet.

I rate and watch a lot of movies here and on other sites, and yes this isn't going to be a critically acclaimed movie or win any Oscars, but for all out insane fun and literally rolling on the floor laughing, this movie gets a 10!!!  If you were a fan of Wedding Crashers, love Jim Carrey stupid type of humor, or just enjoy crazy stupid funny one liners, then run to the nearest DVD rental and get this one, because you are going to bust a gut.  They must have had a ton of fun making this one, because I sure had a ton of fun watching it.  I found the humor similar to \"The Wedding Crashers\", and probably retread on some other plots from other famous movies, but it still felt like it had a fresh approach.  Loved it and going to tell all my friends about it, it is definitely a keeper for me, and one that I will put ll out of my collection again and again when I need some cheering up or need a good laugh.  You do the same if you haven't seen it save it for a day your down and need to smile or laugh.  Again I loved it and very well done Cameron, Leslie, and Kate wtg girls-thanks.",
