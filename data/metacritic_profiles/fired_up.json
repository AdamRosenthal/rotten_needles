The jokes come hard, fast and un-PC, but they are never mean-spirited; there are tons of obvious and obscure (visual and verbal) references for geeky viewers to parse and the whole thing is extremely self-referential and postmodern-y. Think less \"American Pie\" and \"Bring It On\" and more \"Clueless\" and \"Popular\" on hormonal overdrive. Well worth a watch, just like the director's follow-up \"Easy A\".",
