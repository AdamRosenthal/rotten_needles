Especially, the absurdly re-jiggered version of Gloria Gaynor\u2019s \u201cI Will Survive\u201d, sung by the poisonous pink frog Gabi. Rendered by Kristin Chenowet, it\u2019s definitely worth a mention. Though the film is visually appealing and picturesque, the highlight of Rio 2 is the beautifully choreographed soccer game in which Blu finds himself at the receiving end. Coming from director Carlos Saldanha, who had previously delivered Ice Age, Rio 2 would definitely appeal to kids and adults alike.",

Sadly, in general it is much inferior compared to its first film in terms of concept and story line as it is not as meaningful or as adventurous as its predecessor.",

This is a true secret to a strong sequel: take off from where the previous film ends, thrown in new ideas for the plot to make it bigger and better, more colourful and vibrant and this creating a sole film into a franchise. Ignore the critics they are too serious. Rio 2 brings newly improved crispy and fleshy visuals than the original. It's story is great which deals family matters and relationship, the music is funky and lively, the voice casts is well-talented but the only thing that doesn't work out much is the hit-or-miss gags. Overall, it still enjoyable to watch at.",
