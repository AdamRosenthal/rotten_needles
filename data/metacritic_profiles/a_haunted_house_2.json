This movie did make me laugh a couple times but I didn't laugh so hard it was just a chuckle. This was the worst film on 2014 next to Earth to Echo. If A Haunted House 3 or Scary Movie 6 comes out I'm done, that may sound extreme but these should stop. Who wants to watch Marlyon Wayons hump an Annabelle doll for 2 minutes. Don't watch this movie even if you are trashed. A Haunted House 2 is a huge mess splattered with utter horse ****",

It had a couple chuckle worthy moments but I found myself too frustrated to laugh because of all the annoying forced \"humor\" that surrounded it.",
