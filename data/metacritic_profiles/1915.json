Juliette Binoche is once again astounding playing a woman trapped in her own mind but perhaps most terrifying, isolated and restrained in an asylum by a world that simply will not understand her. The Claudel of this film is restrained and a true victim of the world around her. Dependent on others for her freedom and sanity, CAMILLE CLAUDEL 1915, depicts a person becoming more insane by the hands of others. It is a film that shakes you to the core in loneliness and oblivion.",
