It just shows these families who's kids are being bullied, and that's it. The major problem with this is that it doesn't offer any solution, and personally I think because there is no solution. Bullying is evil; to an extent, and we all know that with good there's always going to be bad. It's how the world works and we may wish for a world of purity and innocence, but then it wouldn't be called living. Unfortunately though some people have bigger misfortunes than others, we feel sympathy for them for their loss, but it seems almost wrong to release their stories as a theatrical film. That's another thing that bothered me, if the director wanted to spread the word of this, why didn't he/she just put it on a website or something? The film wasn't a great success at the box office, so is it because people don't care or because they don't want to see a cruel and just downright depressing feature. I personally think that one could get the message across better if they made it not as depressing, but at least offered some positive atmosphere as well.",

This movie needs to be seen in middle school assemblies across the country to draw greater attention to this scourge.  I remember when David Toma visited thousands of schools in the 80s scaring the hell out of us kids about the dangers of drug and alcohol abuse.  It was effective!  This movie clearly has its faults - I would have loved to have seen at least one affluent community included in the mix.  Bullying is by no means limited to rural, Bible-belt, and middle-class communities. There are mean girls, social media predators, etc. in big cities, on the coasts, etc. Obviously, they had to pick a small slice of the country in which to examine the issue, and it's largely effective. Obviously, I don't have all the answers, beyond simply urging those to befriend and stick up for those being bullied. I would urge school administrators to red-flag bullies on their permanent records with a standardized \"bully\" label that would follow these kids through their college application process (though college is probably not a high priority for many of these students). Suspensions and expulsions for bullying need to happen with greater regularity. I feel for the parents of those deceased bullying victims and applaud them for speaking out, which I'm sure is incredibly painful.",

Bully wisely opts to simply tell the stories of these young victims thus allowing us to put ourselves in their place.  Still, a part of me wishes that the film would have gotten just a little bit angrier at times and called the bullies onto the carpet to explain their actions.  But change has to start somewhere and Bully is a promising step in the right direction.",

      "text": "Bully is only sad for about 3 minutes, but that doesn't mean it's a no-good documentary. The message is meaningful and many of the tales depressing, but it seems to be a bit volatile and have many of its morals jumbled up. It barely ever touches the side of the bullies (which may seemed biased, but bias is the only proper method of propaganda), and seems to show a girl who brought a gun onto a school bus as a hero and not a wrongdoer. This film is well made with good cinematography, and is very atmospheric and emotional. Overall, Bully is good, but it's hard to fully agree with what they are trying to make this movie out of.",

      "text": "Today kids are killing themselves and each other at an alarming rate. The one thing all these cases seem to have in common is bullying. There was bullying when I was a kid, but 3 PM meant the end of the trouble. We had the rest of the day, the weekend, and the summer to recover. The advent of social media and cell phones has made the respite obsolete, as now, bullies can torture their victims 24/7. Bully is an award winning documentary that looks at the problems of bullying and shows the effects it has on children's lives. What I like about this film is that it showed a whole group of students from different economic, social, and ethnic backgrounds. What I took away is that anyone who is even slightly different in anyway, could be a target. What I didn't like was the solutions the film offers. Their solution is to tell someone and to stand up for kids you see being bullied, but anyone who has been bullied will tell you that those are not good ideas. Often times telling someone will anger the bully and make it worse, and as for standing up for other kids, often times that makes someone who wasn't previous bullied, a target. I think the answer is two-fold, in that first, parents need to tell their kids, from a very earlier age, that being unique, different, and even weird are admirable qualities in a person. I also believe the schools need to be tougher, because honestly, does anyone really think that giving a bully detention, telling them they're not nice, and that their hurting other kids really does anything? I think bullies need a taste of their own medicine, to feel those powerful emotions for even for just one day. You can talk until you're blue in the face, but you don't really know what something is like until you've experienced it for yourself.",

For ten dollars there is no excuse not to own this if you're a parent. I plan on showing my daughter this film when shes old enough. Powerful documentary. I've seen a follow up on it on CNN's Anderson Cooper lately and its incredible to see how this film gave one of the young men who was bullied some new found confidence. Truly awesome to see! This film has the power to change lives. When making a documentary you couldn't ask for a better outcome than that!",
