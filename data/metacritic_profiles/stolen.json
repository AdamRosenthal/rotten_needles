This film commonly reminds me of 'Taken', the scenario with a kidnapped daughter, which from many aspect of blockbusters is becoming bland and boring. I mean maybe in 'Die Hard' and a few arnie schwarzenegger films, but in the 21st century you need more plot content and plot twists than the plain old story. The story is based around the farther (Nicholas Cage) being a bank robber, at firth thought i was hoping for an epic action packed film. However the film turns from an action packed first 10 minuets to a long predictable low budget middle. With a believe at least 30 minuets of a guy driving round in a yellow cab. There is poor character development, as well as a lack in creativity. The ending is highly predictable and reminds me of a low budget 80s film. The attempt at comedy is bleak at best.",

      "text": "Nicholas Cage is known to enjoy making bad action films. However he somehow manages to make them fun wither either his oddball performances or his tongue in cheek sense of humour. For example Con-Air (also directed by Simon West) is a bad film but cage makes it entertaining with his over the top southern lilt. Stolen on the other hand is just garbage. When Bank Robber Will Montgomery (Cage) is released from prison a man from his past ransoms his daughter for the 10 million dollars he thinks he deserves. Without any options he must attempt a dangerous heist with the help of old friend Riley (Malin Akerman) to rescue his daughter. I'll keep it short because I honestly believe trying to find merit in a film like this is akin to drawing blood from a stone. The film has only one entertaining element and that is Josh Lucas' villain. He is hilarious to watch as his acting is so terrible its moderately funny. Besides that the film is one mistake after another. The finale is the worst offender as the action is awful as the scenes are dark and impossible to see, Cage looks like the film has finally broken him and the film nosedives into the credits. The father daughter dynamic is non existent and Cage and Akerman have little to no chemistry so the entire 2nd act doesn't work. In fact the whole film doesn't work, it is a misconceived abomination of a film.",

      "text": "If you like Nicolas Cage, you will like Stolen, because it is vintage Cage with a capital \u201cC.\u201d He swaggers, he sweats, and he suffers over ethical dilemmas. Just when you think he is a hardened criminal who has seen it all, it turns out he has a soft spot for his little girl. After getting out of jail, he stops to buy her a teddy bear before turning up at her doorstep for the first time ime in eight years, which might be why he was a little out of touch with the fact that she is now a teenager who wears make-up and sees a psychiatrist. Now in his late forties in real life, Cage has not lost his style or his boyish looks, nor has he lost his perfect timing or his mellow voice with that laid-back Californian lilt. There is something comforting about Nicolas Cage in his role of Will Montgomery. As an antihero who is a thieving genius with a heart of gold, this is a role that Cage can play with his hands tied behind his back, but it is still a lot of fun to watch him at work. Cage's Will Montgomery makes it clear that robbing banks is simply something he does because he can earn a living while he uses his criminal brilliance to outsmart the system. But he refuses to kill or hurt anyone. This gets him in trouble with his closest associate who wants to shoot a witness at the scene of the crime. \u201cWe're not killers,\u201d says Will Montgomery as he drags his comrade away by force. The movie has typical superhero-type problems with realism, as Will tracks down a vengeful madman who has abducted his daughter, but the script does make an attempt to give logical explanations for the action. Although Will Montgomery has his own bizarre form of ethics, in his chase scenes he causes so many car accidents that it is a stretch to think he never hurt anyone. But he never turns a gun on any innocent party, and his primary role is that of father. In his own weird way, Will is just trying to support his family. Will is the nemesis of FBI agent Tim Harlend, played by Danny Huston. The chemistry between these two foes is perfect as they develop a grudging respect for each other. Malin Akerman is the smart and feisty Riley who emerges as Will's love interest. (There is a strange cell phone conversation where the two slip into Swedish to avoid detection. No explanation is offered for this detail, except it turns out that Akerman has Swedish roots in real life.) And Josh Lucas does a great job as the crazed Vincent, a good thief gone rogue. The film holds your interest and is highly entertaining, although there are a few places that may cause viewers to groan a bit. However, it is refreshing to see a violent action film where violence is abhorred by the bad guy himself. The contradictions that arise from this antithetical position make Nicolas Cage's character a lot more interesting than he might have been otherwise.",

      "text": "Whenever I see Nicolas Cage's name on a movie poster, I know that no matter the film, I'm going to see a great performance. While Cage has done every conceivable genre, he is of course best know for his action films. In Stolen, Cage once again teams with his Director from Con Air, Simon West, to give us another exciting thriller. Cage plays Will Montgomery, a career criminal who has just spent eight years in prison. Montgomery comes out wanting to start a new life, but that's put on hold when he learns that a former enemy has kidnapped his daughter and is holding her for ransom. I guess no one has ever told Nicolas Cage that you're supposed to slow down with age, because he is just as good in this movie as he is in all his other films. Cage, notorious for performing his own stunts, does some amazing things in this film and is of course pure intensity. In this film he's paired with Josh Lucas who was in a film by the same title in 2009, not to be confused with that movie, Lucas plays Montgomery's partner in crime and throughout this film you can see him and Cage feed off of one another, too me, that was the best part. Lets be honest here, rarely do action films have a decent story to distinguish themselves from one another. Stolen is no different, a daughter in peril, held by a weird foul mouthed bad guy, who is being chased by a want to be hero with a less than stellar reputation, you've seen this dozens of times.  What makes Stolen stand out from those other films is the cast, it's as simple as that. The cast really keeps you interested, even when the movie gets to be predictable and even when the stunts are impossible, the cast keep bringing you back to the edge of your seat, with their great performances and extreme intensity. For that reason, even though this is a familiar and predictable film, Stolen stood out from all the other action films I've seen lately.",
