Tyler's supposed to be this rebellious, lost young man with a bad relationship with his father, yet Robert Pattinson only brings out a cold, emotionless character. The romance between Ally and Tyler looked so strained and fake - it didn't come across as real feelings, they both just looked too cold and heartless, especially in each other. The part where \"Tuesday September 11 2001\" was written on the chalkboard came as a huge shock to me and made my heart skip a beat. However using it as a way to kill off the main character just to end the movie in the last 5 minutes does not depict the real tragedy behind 9/1/1. Waste of my time, I'm so disappointed in this movie.",

I had no interest in seeing this even if it did have some of my favorite actors in it namely Chris Cooper and Pierce Brosnan (both of which are phenomenal in this film) it had almost been two maybe three months into this film release that I started to become interested in it. Especially after a news article surfaced about the film talking about the films twist ending my interest in this film soared.

      "text": "This is the most underrated movie in recent years. I won't spoil anything, but I think the reviewers who are angry at this movie don't understand its intent. The ending of the movie is the essence of the movie; the movie's whole point. It's the kind of movie that needed to be made. There have been other movies that have tackled this topic, and very few have had the impact with it that this one had, and its because of its clever execution. Without saying too much, the issue tackled in this movie came across in real life the way it came across in the movie: shocking. By handling the topic in this manner, the viewer was able to feel the same emotions all over again. The movie was an in depth look at the life, struggles, and relationships of someone who experienced what happened at the end of this movie, and how it affected the people around that person, and it was executed in such a way that it came across to the viewers just like how it came across to that person's family. The only reason I didn't give it a higher rating was because of everything leading up to it. It wasn't a very well written script up to that point, although it had its moments. This had the potential to be one of the greatest movies of all time, as the essence of the movie was absolutely brilliant. However, up to that point, it was really just a typical teen romance movie. Had this movie had stronger character development and a more fascinating storyline, it would've been Best Picture worthy. I know that seems like saying if Mrs. Lincoln's husband wouldn't have been shot she would've enjoyed the theater, but the first two hours of the movie really aren't what the movie's about. The movie really is the last few scenes. Those scenes are more emotionally powerful, and make more of a statement than most Best Picture winners. Like I said: this is an idea for a movie that had to happen.",

The story and its characters were intriguing, and each had their demons that kept you wondering what their past was. Robert Pattinson really shined in this movie, as did Emilie de Raven.
