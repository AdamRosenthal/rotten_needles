      "text": "This movie was something far from what I expected. When going into a World War 2 movie I have nothing but fond memories of seeing camaraderie and people banding together, mercy and suffering, beauty amongst all the pain in the ways the soldiers interact not only with each other as brothers in arms but with their enemies as warriors of the highest caliber. Respect and honor and so forth. I also believe it's important to involve scenes depicting the depravity of war, war in all its shades from darkest moments, to light hearted conversations, to acts of valor beyond the normal human's comprehension. Fury attained some of these goals yet they were few and far between. It captured the depravity of war than went on to blow it into epic proportions with soldiers cussing at every five second interval, looking at women in captured towns as meat for them to rip into at their own leisure, and what may have been others was now, well, theirs. Fury disgusted me in this showing of barbarism, I feel as if the director looked at World War 2 propaganda and decided that was all their was to the war. I know very well that war has these incidents yet this often? It made me think it was some child trying to convince me of the brutality of his mother's beating by over-exaggerating every detail. The battle scenes were incredible, and executed perfectly even the explicit language had some sense when used in these scenes, aside from the overdramatic effect of some weapons they were quite well done, until of course the final fight scene. Ah, the final scene, where Fury finally attained the essence of camaraderie among the soldiers and made you root for them every second, until you realized they needed no help against the Nazi's they were fighting. To call these SS Nazis, soldiers was almost a laughable idea. The SS were known for their brutality and amazing battle skills, but apparently if you pit them up against a Sherman (a tank mocked by even the American's themselves when sizing them up to any other tank) they fall like flies, throwing their bodies at it until something cracks, refusing to fire weapons thinking it'd be safer to rush the tank and wave their arms wildly to stop the gunfire. You may think an RPG even in World War 2 was able to be fired from a distance, but according to Fury you'd be wrong, and even point blank it seems as if these RPGs can miraculously miss a shot worse than a musket from ages past. It's hard to believe these \"SS soldiers\" could even walk without falling over themselves. I feel if any veteran actually saw this movie they'd wonder why they themselves ever feared these spoon fed children. Some people might say \"Oh, but the Nazi's recruited everyone at this stage in the war, in fact it was stated in the movie.\" in which case I'd say yes, it was stated excellently so in fact. One of the few moments where the American's seemed almost likable was when they executed the SS officer who hung children. But I would also say that although they recruited everyone, the SS was something you were not thrown into unless you deserved it. I found myself almost rooting for the Nazis after the forced execution of a surrendered soldier. Fury made our Golden Generation of warriors seem like monsters. If the director of this film (I had no intention to try to memorize the name of the director after seeing this movie) read into even a piece of war accounts by soldiers and reporters in the field, he/she may have realized the way our soldiers actually behaved was courteous and kind in most accounts, of course there were times when our soldiers were out of line but they were almost always stopped by a commanding officer. Nonetheless the worst part by far was the fact that Fury made the SS look merciful compared to us. I know the clich\u00e9 of \"young soldier spares enemy because of some level of compassion and fear\" but an SS soldier? Really? An SS soldier would have killed him on the spot, yet it shows our soldiers ruthlessly murder a surrendering Nazi? This movie had few good points, I'm sure if any veteran watched this movie they would be disgusted at how they were portrayed. All in all the movie isn't worth the price of admission, it was a wasted two hours of propaganda to try to slander our Golden Generation.",

Intensity is also built within Fury through the nuanced audio and visual production.  This isn't futuristic in terms of the special effects that happen on screen, but so masterfully do the audio and visual elements work together - everything felt real and impactful, almost as if I was walking with soldiers fighting on the front lines.

This movie had a lot of hype coming out and I think it largely was able to live up to most of it. Brad Pitt, Logan Lerman, Shai LaBeouf, Jon Bernthal, and Michael Pena form a fantastic cast of unique and substantially developed characters. The acting of Pitt and Bernthal especially carry the film. The plot, though lacking much premise beyond the war itself, is also developed really well throughout. There is one particular scene towards the midpoint of the film when they're about to leave a city after capturing it that really stood out and is, in my opinion, one of the best scenes in war movie history. Unfortunately, the movie couldn't carry that emotion throughout the rest of the film. The closing battle sequence was a little too \"Hollywood\" and didn't vibe with the realism and grit of the rest of the movie. Because of that, many of the character deaths felt unauthentic and didn't deliver the emotion that they should've. Overall, it's still a solid movie but it had potential to be much better.",

The film follows a veteran tank crew during the end of WWII in Nazi Germany and that gains a new recruit after one of its members dies during combat. The cast does a great job and while i did hate that they were all pretty much complete **** yes even Brad Pitt although he was still a likable **** still though that's what you would have to expect in war because war is brutal. The action scenes were absolutely amazing because of how gory it was like right from the beginning we see a Nazi riding on a horse by the tank and from behind the entrance we see Brad Pitt come out from and tackle the Nazi off his horse and stab him in the face a couple times from that part i knew i was going to like the movie. The whole scene with Brad Pitt and Logan Lerman characters and the two girls was pretty boring and pointless but i see why they decided to add it still though it did drag on for a bit too long. The ending battle was truly epic and it showed a lot of my favorite aspect of the film which was the tracer rounds seeing all the red and green bullets racing across the screen was seriously awesome it may be random but that's what i liked the most.",

The battle scenes are as intense, realistic and unnerving as the opening scene of Saving Private Ryan (the storming of the beach at Normandy on D-day).  The in-your-face intensity never lets up thruout the 2+ hr running time.  At movie's end, all viewers will have a much greater understanding as to why soldiers involved in combat will be scarred or adversely affected for the rest of their lives.  The tank crew portrayed in the movie had been pounded literally for more than a yr and had fought in most of the major battles as the allies moved across Europe towards Germany after the landing at Normandy.  It's a movie all should see, but some will feel that it is too intense to remain seated thruout.  I wouldnt describe this movie as entertaining...it isnt.

The acting was OK and the characters generally seemed to be trying hard despite the formulaic roles: tough but caring Sarge (Pitt), mandatory minority (Pena, a Mexican-American since the army was segregated at the time), bible-thumping Southerner (LaBeouf), sensitive-rookie-who-becomes-a-man-after-the-ordeal- of-combat( (Lerman) and the psychotic cop from Walking Dead (Bernthal). There is plenty of activity but it is comic book, juvenile stuff and the writer of this epic was obviously never in the army and never saw action. Nor has he bothered to read any realistic accounts of people who have been there. Had he done so he would have known that no tank regiment drives in to a town for a showdown through groups of wandering civilians who don't seem to be aware there's a war on. He would have known that preparing to ambush a relieving German column, some of whose members are clearly shown shouldering panzerfausts (aka bazookas or RPGs), with a single immobile tank would have been short and pointless. When the showdown comes, moreover, the Germans apparently forget they have anti-tank weapons and run around the tank like Red Indians around a covered wagon, which allows many of them to be gunned down like ...Red Indians.  As In Saving Private Ryan, the hero dies a soldier's death or at least the sort of death Ayers imagines heroic soldiers die. That is, after the Germans finally get around to lobbing a couple of grenades in the tank Pitt's corpse is not painted to the interior as would happen with an explosion in a confined spaces. His body reclines heroically in its final pose, all limbs attached, where it is found by the rookie after he crawls back in to the tank after his life has been inexplicably spared by an SS trooper who discovers him hiding underneath it.

The movie starts out with Brad Pitt brutally murdering a nazi commander and that set the entire tone of the movie. This movie tries its hardest to make you \"feel something!\" Im supposed to feel shocked at how brutal and unforgiving this war is with all of the death and murder that happens but I just got bored of all the gore and brutality. The story is ok, but the characters are the spawn of satan, they are all willing to kill surrendering nazis and make the new draft kid do it, rather than interrogating him. You will find yourself rooting for the nazis more than the allies because the nazis do not appear as bad as the horrible American army. The ending almost made me lose my **** after they gunned down hundreds of nazis only the rookie is left and he hides under the tank. Yet a nazi finds him and let's him live! \"Hey I know you horribly murdered all of my friends but hey we bros so I'll cut you some slack.\" Not only that but they take a innocent girl hostage and because the rookie knows how to play piano she develops Stockholm syndrome and bangs him wtf. Screw this movie and it's rape imagery and its horrible characters. Do not see this movie it is not worth it.",

I found myself actually hating all the main characters but one, and the one I didn't hate is purely on the account of him doing absolutely nothing. The film tries to be dramatic and thought provoking but all it really accomplishes is making me feel uncomfortable for no reason at all. It shallow and sporadic in its tone and mother of all thats holy the final two fight scenes are a true travesty beyond compare. I wont spoil anything, but the sheer level of stupidity displayed by the German soldiers is unbridled. Its nonsensical in all ways. Even taking into account the wiggle room afforded by movie magic does this film just insult my intelligence by asking me to believe that the Germans would be so keen as to just throw themselves in front of the enemies guns. Its absurd and breaks immersion and is bad. Just bad. The movie was bad. The characters were bad. The German acting was bad (boiled down to \"SCHENLL FRITZ SCHENLL SHUTZ DIE AMERICANA!\".

As I watched the movie unfold I could not help but think back to an old movie my father took me to as a boy back in 1955 starring real life war hero Audie Murphy in To Hell And Back.  Audie was the most decorated soldier of all time. He survived the war but died in a plane crash at age 45.  Brad Pitt's portrayal very much resembles Audie Murphy's.

Fury is not necessarily a film makers film, like Tarantion's Basterds, but rather a thematic study that harkens on the motifs and themes of war novels and movies  such as, the randomness of war, the brotherhood of combat and the duplicitous nature of mankind during times of war and stress (shreds of humanity in a sea of barbarity). Unfortunately, unlike novels like \"All Quiet...\" the Hollywoodization of the film was reflected in the blatant, obvious attempts, at times, to be so over the top with making sure the audience got the message. The simplistic, stereotypical characters of war show up here and are on display at moments when the direct wants viewers to \"get\" the message. It is hammered home through repetition and exaggeration. Additionally, Hollywood shows up again at the crossroads where the heroic feats of our crew are hyperbolic in nature and suspension of disbelief needs to be employed. To the good side, however, the film does exceptionally well in the veracity department. The nomenclature of war is there for all to see. Tiger tanks, the \"ronson\" tanks (Shermans) the effects of the MG42 and so on, make this film a visual fantasy for any war buff. And while the themes are sometimes blatantly obvious they are nevertheless true to the viciousness of war and mankind's quest to solve conflict through violence when words don't work (hence Pitt's relatively quiet demeanor). High production values, steady acting overall and thematic elements make this dark, dirty and gritty film worth seeing.",

To most kids and young adults today it's just an esoteric concept: yeah, a lot of people shot back and forth at each other, many of them died, Hitler was an evil psycho nutcase but so was Stalin, we tossed a couple of nukes on Japan and the whole thing was over. But it was so much more than that. Unless one actually participated in combat, the abject horror and hideous nature of warfare during WW2 is difficult to fully comprehend. How soldiers and civilians coped in war-torn Europe is beyond what most any of us today can conceive in our minds. \"Fury\" brings the viewer directly into the thick of all this - vivid life-or-death combat, disparate personalities struggling to get along, inter- and intra-personal conflict, moral conflict, the difference between \"doing good\" and survival, all brilliant portrayed by a cast led by Brad Pitt. War history buffs may find a few technical faults here and there, but that's not the point of the film. Rather, it's a stark story of war's brutality, survival of the fittest, a seasoned-veteran's struggle to cope and lead his men, a boy barely into adulthood's baptism of fire and blood (as well as loss of virginity). The futility of it all is clear throughout the story - this is no glorification of war or the WW2 Allies - it's the gritty depiction of a single tank crew's struggle to stay sane, alive and, as they express often in the film...\"do our job...\" This is without a doubt Pitt's greatest performance - by far the most complex and challenging character of his career - and he delivers without disappointment. The core cast all turn in Oscar-caliber performances but the real surprise (and treat) were the deeply complex, realistic and poignant performances by Shia Labeouf and Logan Lerman, both of whom are basically fresh-off-the-Disney/Pixar wagon and still reeking of teen idoldom. Labeouf's portrayal of Boyd Swan, the tank's gunner, a devout, Middle-America scripture-quoting Christian who gives God all the credit for his bulls-eye hits on the enemy (and the human carnage resulting therefrom) is a powerful study of the clash between love-thy-neighbor doctrine and kill-or-be-killed. You lose count quickly of the Germans dispatched to the next life as a result of his expertise. But in a peaceful moment of spiritual discourse with his tank-mates , Swan makes a convincing argument that of course God loves Hitler. Lerman, still looking all the world like a baby-faced teenager but with a little scruffy beard stubble, delivers a brilliant performance as Nathan Ellison, a fresh out of high school clerk-typist who somehow gets diverted to the Front. Those of us old enough to remember can't help but draw some comparison to M*A*S*H's \"Radar\" character - the innocence at least, but definitely not the funny. Never even having been trained for tank warfare, Ellison is immediately overwhelmed with the reality of continuously staring death in the face. His transformation from boy to man is a horrific coming-to-grips with \"kill or be killed\". In my humble opinion, Lerman's portrayal absolutely deserves Oscar consideration, as does the entire film.",

Fury does a good job at immersing you in it's environment, with amazing sound effects and great back and forth banter between the crew. Fury's strong points are obviously It's Cast and Visual Effects but it surprised me with it's slower parts with a bit of real story and situations that make you sympathetic for the crew. It even has few small details in it's environment I've only read about in books. I felt like there were a few weeks points early on in the film but once the film got up-to pace it's very enjoyable.",

They did throw in a young soldiers struggle to come to terms with war and killing, and that was the major story line next to how inferior the American tanks were to the German tanks during WWII.  The whole movie was basically inside a tank.  I think the final battle went overboard and became ridiculously unbelievable on how a whole platoon of German soldiers took forever to take down one inferior American tank with only a few American soldiers on board.

Effects look great and the film was deliciously savage in gore which I didn\u2019t exit to be so brutal but it adds to the effect of the overall film. The direction can make you feel claustrophobic at times which may help add to the immersion of the men inside the tank but you do get to fully witness the battles that go on throughout too.",

      "text": "How can a movie critic write a review of a serious movie without seeing it at least  a few times. Fury is a serious movie, and one worthy of the time needed to watch it at least three times. A viewer needs to see Fury at least times to understand its genius. A critic should reveal his or her criteria about a film depend on the following: 1. is the story ; 2. the moral of the film; 3. the purpose of the film; 4. the acting; 5. movie quality; 6. focus of the film on the moral and the purpose; 7. realism and accuracy; 8. entertainment value; 9. is it memorable; 10. is the film worth the time it takes to watch it. Fury, in my opinion, is a great film, and one of the greatest war films ever made. (For comparison, I give high grades to Paths of Glory, Saving Private Ryan, Attack!, Breaker Morant, The Grand Illusion.) The main character in Fury is Don \"Wardaddy\" Collier, an American staff sergeant who is a tank commander and who speaks German. The men in his Sherman tank, which is a death box, look to him for leadership and to save their lives. Sgt. Collier longs for a normal life, even though he is living a life of hell: continuous death, savagery, human degradation, cruelty, capriciousness. In spite of his combat skill and experience, Sgt. Collier is only human. He tries to escape by himself to think, to breath deeply, and to find a normal life. During the middle of the film, Collier and Private Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman) find two German women, an aunt and her niece in a second floor apartment. Collier creates a scene reminiscent of a breakfast with the husband and wife. Collier manages to clean himself somewhat and shave. He gives six eggs to the German woman, who cooks breakfast for her niece, Lerman (Pvt. Norman Ellison) and Collier. We see Collier reading the newspaper, smoking, and drinking coffee. Norman, who is the most educated and cultured of the tank crew  -- and the most inexperienced and naive  -- plays the piano and has an innocent encounter with the niece. Collier has found his peace in this hideous war. Yet, not for long, as the three member of his crew  --  Grady (Jon Bernthal), Gordo (Michael Pena), and Bible (Shia Lebouf), adulterate Collier's serenity. Grady presents as avaricious and amoral; Gordo has similar traits as Grady, but slightly less so; Bible presents as a devout Christian, who kills as necessary, even as he preaches the Christian Gospel. The movie graphically portrays tank living and tank death. (Many US soldiers died hideous death in Sherman tanks, which were no match for the German Tiger tanks.) Fury also reveals an American army that has forgotten the rules of war as it applies to the German SS. The time of the film is April 1945. The Germans have all but lost the war; however, they will not quit: they fight ferociously to protect their land, Germany. Collier and his crew know that the war will soon end. Yet, what is their duty? Does the approaching end of the war change their attitude and their actions? Collier and his men will decide how they will end their part in this war. Fury is entertaining throughout. It graphically and accurately portrays tank battles and fighting. It shows the decisions soldiers must make, and how they accept their almost certain death. I do not know how David Ayer could have written or directed a better war film. I rate this film a 10.",
