While \"Planes\" may succeed in this, and while it may be enough for some young children, the narrative does suffer. The film's narrative is downright predictable, and a little disappointing, considering that the \"Cars\" franchise used a lot of its universe to its advantage, while \"Planes\", uses its universe mostly for puns and stereotypes. While characters like Dusty, may be easy to root for, his story is definitely a little over the top cheesy as the film moves along; which ends up to be a sort of weird and awkwardly structured romance with Dusty and a Indian racer, with them flying around the Taj Mahal. Another thing to note is the film's humor, which would have benefited the film, but unfortunately doesn't work. Most of the humor depends on the characters, which, to me, felt a lot absurd, as many of the characters are a lot cliche to the type of underdog film this is. Though this may seem like negative criticism, the thing that \"Planes\" does well at is try to get your emotions through this underdog story, which I thought was well done. Though this may be the case, \"Planes\" has some heart, animation, and slapstick humor that can entertain, but unfortunately is pushed down with its mediocre narrative, absurd humor, and cliche elements.",

Dusty wants to be a racer and with the help of his mentor Skipper (Stacy Keach) and a little luck he might just get to do what he wants.

However the director pretends that's all he needs and carries on regardless in the search for something that can  scrape the bottom of average. It doesn't. While the ride works its bumpy, cringe worthy and unoriginal,a trifecta of awfulness that added together makes Planes a horrific viewing experience. Dane Cook is surprisingly not offensive but the whole film is, it insults peoples intelligence as we are forced to watch Cars again.",

      "text": "The Croods and Turbo managed to beat the combination Monsters University and Planes (although the latter was not Pixar). Luckily that is not Disney Toons and not from Pixar. Pixar already suffered too because after Cars 2 and Disney Toons and used to deliver bad sequels (Pocahontas 2 Tarzan 2 Cinderellas 2) but also managed some good (Tinkerbell, the movie Break Tigger and the movie). This movie is a descepcion and a very cheap copy of Cars only with Aircraft. The plot is typical and leads to a typical end, lack of charisma to the characters and the short duration (10 is longer than the Tinkerbell minutes). The only thing I liked was the animation accompanied by a good 3D. Do not go see it, if they want to see an animated let it go and wait for another animated film premiere is best.",
