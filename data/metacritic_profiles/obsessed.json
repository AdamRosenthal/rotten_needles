Singers becoming actors just doesn't work, i mean look at Mariah Carey and Chris Brown. They really shoulda casted Taraji .P. Henson for Beyonce's role. She woulda gave that character some life. Idris and Ali Larter were good and their roles but they shoulda expanded more on why she was OBSSESSED with him to begin with.",

Props to the two leading ladies as well as Idris Elba who is between them. It's a type of film that has been done before, but I personally don't think this well. It didn't get the best of reviews, but I quite liked it right to the very end with that rather forceful girl-on-girl fight!",

But as a movie it never takes it to the next level or goes into the grey area. Each actor plays their stock character well but the story never explores anyone back story nobody has a skeletons no plot twists nothing. Ali does a great jobs as one of America most underexposed actresses Beyonce and Alba were good but it was just so flat.",
