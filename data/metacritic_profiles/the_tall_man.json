      "text": "Over the past decade, children have been disappearing in the downtrodden town of Cold Rock, but now, one mother is fighting back when her son becomes the next victim of the Tall Man. Pascal Laugier, writer and director of the controversial shocker MARTYRS, returns with THE TALL MAN, a suspense thriller that marks a dramatic shift in style and tone from the director's previous film. THE TALL MAN echoes the writings of Stephen King in many ways, but mainly in its small town setting, the monster of legend that plagues the town, and in the narration that is provided by one of the town's young children. Jessica Biel stars as Julia Denning, a nurse whose selfless attempts cannot save the dying community from itself. Biel's performance carries the film, but despite her best efforts, her character simply isn't compelling enough to garner our sympathy or support. While the final reveal may seem like a cheat to the many viewers who set their sights on the supernatural, Laugier still surprises with an altruistic message of hope that few could have anticipated. THE TALL MAN will hold a certain appeal with fans of both Stephen King and M. Night Shyamalan.",

      "text": "The Tall Man tries very hard to be something it's not, a Stephen King story. Parts of this film reek with King's influence, but I don't think he'd be all that thrilled about it. When the film first started I thought it was a pretty good movie, but by the end I was just confused. The story follows a local resident in the town of Cold Rock, who has taken over her husband's medical practice after he passed away. That resident is played by Jessica Biel, whose performance and looks are really the only reason to watch this movie. In the town of Cold Rock, the children have been disappearing without a trace and the only thing people have seen is a tall man, dressed in black, leaving the scene. Some people say he's an urban legend, while others claim to have witnessed his abductions, and the whole town is terrified. I found it kind of funny that in a town crippled by fear, not knowing whose child could be next, the kids parents, let them ride their bikes to the store and let them play alone in the fields, it's just one of many parts of this film that just off. As I said, the beginning of this film is terrific, but then it gets weirder and weirder and builds to a conclusion that doesn't make any damn sense! I know this must of have been someone's passion and that they spent years developing it, but before you released it to the public, did you bother to watch it? Jessica Biel is sexy and a terrific actress who is way too good to be doing  b-movies like this. If you're a die-hard fan, check it out, she's great, but if you're not, I'd definitely stay away from this one.",
