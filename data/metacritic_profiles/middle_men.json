      "text": "From the opening sequence, I knew I was in for a \"Goodfellas\"-styled drama with morals built into the plot and characters goin' down in order to learn their lessons. The movie didn't really disappoint in this regard, but I did find the portrayal of the narrator, a \"fixer\" for dubious businesses, somewhat strangely represented. In other words, this guy (played with staged nonchalance by Luke Wilson) was too good to be true, given the circumstances of his predicament. When the lead character in a drama filled with slime balls comes off smelling like a rose, then you know you're not getting the full story. And that was the main problem with this film: it is an ultra-sanitized, glamorizing reenactment of some truly ugly moments in the underworld of mobsters and drug addicts and porn.",

This movie was engaging from the beginning to the end with good acting and a good story line. The fact that it was based on true events made it that much more interesting. Even though the story revolves around internet porn and its beginnings it is not a raunchy movie with a bunch of nudity (could be good or bad depending on your interests!). The plot was fascinating, seeing how easily it the idea evolved and how quickly dark elements took control. It was a very pleasant surprise, especially  when you are taking a leap of faith at the video store on a movie you have never heard about!",

Brilliant acting of Giovanni Ribisi, he didn't play this character, he became this character, I really believed it. Also Laura Ramsey, I hope to see more from them in the future. Tiny little 'negative' point: the ending could have been better with a little script editing, I disappoints a little bit, because you can expect it. Anyway, enjoy this piece of art, you won't regret it!\u00e2",
