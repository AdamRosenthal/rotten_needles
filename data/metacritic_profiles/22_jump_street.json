Really?\" it kinda felt like it was rehashing the first movie a little bit. but all that aside, like i said: \"22 Jump Street\" is the most hysterical buddy-cop comedy we got so far this year. and i'll be damned if this wasn't better than the first movie, cause yea it was better and funnier.

The acting and story were great as well as the action scenes. Channing tatum had the best performance especially one part in the movie that had me laughing so hard.

Yes, the underlying plot is the same as 21 Jump Street, but the comedic tone is far more sure-footed, masterfully playing with the idea of a sequel. Not only are Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill at the top of their game, but the supporting cast is brilliant, and each gets an opportunity to shine, especially Jillian Bell whose performance alone is worth the price of admission. Not every gag is a home run, some are just doubles or triples, but there are no strikeouts and a few, like Ice Cube's tantrum, Hill's fist fight and the credits, are World Series worthy.

The plot is simple\u2013the two hilarious undercover cops head back to collage to find and stop a drug ring that has surfaced at the school. One thing that really stood out to me was how self-aware this film was, almost so much so, it becomes annoying. For example, it constantly referenced how sequels never live up to the first one, and how the plot between the two was the same. Something that bothers me in the genre of comedy lately, is the stress factored into a film that is supposed to be relaxing to viewers and hold some good laughs. 22 Jump Street handled this really well, as it had some very funny scenes while some were exaggerated, over-the-top. The movie seemed to reuse jokes and clich\u00e9 ideas that were not very entertaining. Don\u2019t get me wrong, 22 Jump Street is still hilarious, but expect the same kind of comedy as in the original. The chemistry between the two leads is great and carries the whole movie pretty well. I felt like the run time was a bit long and could have been condensed to make a better movie. The pacing was a little off, almost awkward at times, where dead-time could have been filled with more laughs or simply left on the cutting room floor; this detracted from the overall film. Unrealistic scenarious seemed to overwhelm the comedic aspect quite a bit. I have to say, I laughed my butt off. \u00a0Even though it wasn't the most creative comedy, it was simple, didn't require much thinking and let me just sit back and laugh.

With all that said the film isn\u2019t a masterpiece either. The humor feels a bit more eager/desperate to please this time around, the film is more frantic with pacing, and despite all its jokes about unoriginal sequels this film does have a fair amount of rehashing. But the main reason why this film isn\u2019t as good as the first one is it lacks the heart the first one did. All heartfelt moments feel forced and generic and the chemistry between Hill and Tatum isn\u2019t quite as strong as it was in the first film being more mean-spirited this time involving a somewhat generic argument clich\u00e9. Despite all those issues though I enjoyed the film. The saving grace of this film is that most of the jokes work really well preventing it from being a letdown and somewhat disguising the fact that this is a cashgrab. Its miles ahead of the Hangover sequels and is not the disappointment I thought it would be. If you are a fan of the first one definitely check it out as you\u2019ll probably enjoy it just don\u2019t expect a great sequel. If you didn\u2019t like the first one this one won\u2019t do anything to change your mind.  For a film that didn\u2019t needed to exist, and was probably ordered by Hollywood, Chris Miller and Phil Lord stepped up to the plate to deliver a film that may not blow you away or have the same lasting appeal as the first one but is still enjoyable and provides a lot of laughs.

Sure, I felt that they overdid it a bit with this, as well as the exaggerated homosexual innuendos, but the good still far outweighed the bad. Like the last film, the sequences were outrageous but funny and the acting was just dude-bro enough to be spot on for what they were going for. Expanding Ice Cube's role was also a smart idea, as was the casting of the stunning Amber Stevens. It astounds me that she hasn't had more success in her acting career. Overall though, if you enjoyed the first one, you'll like this movie too because 22 Jump Street is essentially the exact same movie as the first film in this newly rebooted franchise... see what I did there?",

      "text": "A good sequel, and despite not quite reaching the level of the first film, still a thoroughly entertaining experience. Going to college was a natural progression as a sequel, and although following the same basic structure as the first film, it brought in characters and jokes which drew away from the blatant similarities to the first instalment. The credits scenes were easily the best credits I've seen and certainly worth staying around for!",
