It has everything from your corny 80's films blended into a 90 minute duration thats so rushed it feels like it was 5 minutes long. The cgi in this film was awful. It was so fake i felt like i was watching someone play a video game, but not even playstation graphics. It was like the wii. It didn't seem like they finished the work on it. They just halfassed the job. The acting was atoricious besides GuyPearce, and another thing, apparently in lockout their is gravity in space, if you see it, you know what dumb scene im talking about. Anyways, everything was just horrible about this film. The only reason im giving it a 2 and not a 0 is because of Guy Pearce, he was hilarious, but that was the only positive i saw.

Guy Pearce did a great job. He kind of reminded me of a \"poor man's\" Mark Wahlberg. The problem came in with the lazy writing that created unbelievable plot development. Add to that the fact that the effects were terrible pretty much throughout the film and the movie goes from really good to just OK. So I guess if you want to see a halfway decent futuristic action movie, check it out.",

      "text": "Luc Besson is the Writer/Director of The Fifth Element and Taken. Usually when you sit down to watch one of his films, you're in for a treat. When he said he was making a new film that combined elements of both popular movies, I was excited, and then sorely disappointed. Lockout introduces us to a new kind of a prison, one that is in outer space, and holds it's prisoners in cryogenic stasis. The daughter of the U.S. President (Maggie Grace) was set to tour the facility, to make sure the prisoners are being treated fairly, when all hell breaks loose. Wanting to restore order with a minimal amount of casualties, the President sends in one man, his best C.I.A. operative, Snow (Guy Pearce), whose job it is to save the hostages. For starters this film is so full of cliques and references to other things that it almost becomes a farce of itself. Guy Pearce is the star and he was very good, however his character plays like John McClain in Outer Space. Snow is full of jokes and is this huge tough guy, who was almost a mirror image of Bruce Willis in Die Hard. The only thing missing was a catch phrase and lets all be thankful for that. Pearce is paired with Maggie Grace, who as in Taken, finds herself as a hostage once again. To her credit, she was a lot less whiny than in Taken and even fights back a little bit, but she basically played the same character that she always does. I don't know about you, but I have a hard time feeling sorry for a beautiful spoiled blonde girl who gets into trouble because she traveled to Europe or had to take on the cause of prisoners rights. Overall, there was a lot of action, but not much of a story to play on. Guy Pearce does a pretty good job, but Lockout is honestly a predictable, paper thin story, with special effects that aren't anything to write home about. It's another big budget film that tries to wow audiences with a unique setting and lots of explosions in the previews, but the only surprise here is that the usually reliable Luc Besson fails to deliver a worthwhile film.",

It has to be said that the best thing about this movie is the somewhat Snake Plissken-like 'f*ck the world' attitude with which Pearce plays the part. Grace isn't on the same level but does a nice enough job. A nice quicky for scifi fans I guess.",

At times the movie has a brush of the feeling of a good summer blockbuster movie but trades it for over the top action that seems cartoon like in a movie that demands realism. Guy Pierce is great as the hero but with dialog that goes on to long, the hero is a bit too dis- interested in the happenings around him. Mix that in with some quick editing, useless over the top violence, and yet another sci-fi movie race against the big bang at the end, and you have a missed opportunity. The idea of John McClane in space is great if only it was done a bit better.",
