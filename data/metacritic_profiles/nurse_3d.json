      "text": "liked this one much more than I thought I would. Why would I watch it if I didn't think id like it so much? I always feel compelled to watch any new horror movie with any degree of hype. This one received a lot of attention leading up to its release and initial reviews were mixed. I thought they did a great job. The sexy nurse character has been referenced in film for ever and its surprising that it took until 2014 for a movie based on the character to surface and I think they did a great job. I believe they have created a character who could one day join the ranks of other horror icons. Paz de la Huerta is a different kind of actress and it takes a minute to get used to her style but after you do it makes her that more memorable. Its cool that she was in the movie Enter The Void which was one of the weirdest trips ive ever seen. She is obviously comfortable with nudity and the movie is sexy to the point of exploitation. They don't just settle for exploitation though (which would have been fine), instead they decide to make a pretty straight faced plot that has a few plot twists and a structure that has more depth than other movies of this type normally have. It seems very well written and has the cast to pull it off. Finally there is also a high gore factor which for me earns it mega bonus points and Huerta's nurse character is crazy as hell. I wouldn't be surprised if they find a way to make a sequel and turn this into a franchise. Nurse 3d hits on all marks and is hopefully the start to a welcomed addition to the horror genre!",

Beautifully played by the very alluring Paz de la Huerta whose flat line readings and constant disrobing are simply perfect. If only NURSE were as good as she. la Huerta is sublime, subtle, and freaky, but as too usual for films like this, they suddenly get serious and rob the lead of all her potential fun. Still... a pretty cool flick on a rainy or snowy winter night.",

      "text": "The story in \"Nurse 3D\" is filled with revenge and thrills guided by a nurse who moonlights as a twisted serial killer that sees herself as a vigilante. The air and breath in which Huerta moves within as this complicated character is at times a disconnect between her portrayal and the believability of the character. Yet Huerta seems so committed to the character that she manages to draw you into the story. Her infatuation with fellow nurse Danni, played by Bowden is instantaneous so you become thrust into this twisted tangle of love, affection, and destruction right from the get-go. All provided through the viewpoint of nurse Abby Russell. The way \"Nurse 3D\" flows has that weird, casual anti-heroine feel that \"Barbwire\" presented. A very Euro feel at times seeming to be influenced by modern giallo and French noir. The actors prove their commitment to the characters but at times the emotional connection flat- lines in the film. There is an overture of camp in the film but more mature and indirect than most films in this same subgenre.",
