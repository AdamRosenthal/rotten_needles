As a sequel, it has more dragons that are very interesting and cool looking. The action, graphics and overall story in the film are great as well! I'm very happy with the progress of the main characters, and it really sets up the 3rd film well. Where I was turned off, was the constant need to force Toothless into doing cute actions. In the first film, Toothless had a genuine cuteness to him, but in the sequel it was overdone and quite frankly became distracting. For example, there would be some important dialogue between characters, and then Toothless would be doing something in the background... I guess they put this is for the kiddies who could care less about what's going on in the story, but as an adult, I care about the characters and the challenges they're trying to overcome... but I couldn't focus on what they were saying with how distracting Toothless became during those scenes. Also, I really liked the rag-tag bunch of Hiccups friends in the first film. They were a ton of fun, but in the sequel, they didn't have the same impact. Astrid as Hiccups girlfriend is boring, and Snotlout, Fishlegs, Tuffnut were not really funny. Ruffnut was definitely the best of the group, but her \"joke\" quickly ran its course, when they used it over and over again. Other than the many distractions from Toothless and the lack of fun from Hiccup's group of friends, this movie was a fantastic sequel. I will recommend it to all families and feel like it's a great challenger to Lego Movie for best animated film of the year.",

We see how Berk has changed and how the lives of everyone on the island has become better, I really love how the film tackles darker subject matter like remorse, forgiveness, and redemption, while at the same time touching on themes of love and loss.

This looks like a live action movie\". but aside from the incredible animation, deep down this movie's something even more. it takes the characters we all loved in the first one to the next level, just like a good sequel should do. ya know in the first movie, Hiccup was the boy, the boy who found a dragon. in HTTYD 2, he has to become the man, the chief of Berk. this reminded of \"The Lion King\" or \"The Empire Strikes Back\". i walked outta the movie like \"This is probably \"The Lion King\" or \"The Empire Strikes Back\" of this generation\". the action's exciting, the comedy's hilarious and it has fantastic emotions. i actually cried like 3 times in \"How To Train Your Dragon 2\". this movie's not just for kids, it's also for adults. i mean, adults are gonna love this movie, cause there are themes that really hit them, and kids are gonna love the movie cause it's a fun and exciting action/fantasy movie with incredible animation and awesome dragons. and when they grow up, they'll start to understand the darker themes and emotional aspects the movie was going for, and they'll appreciate it even more. that's what i call a good sequel! another one of the great highlights in the movie, it's the relationship between Hiccup and Toothless. to Hiccup, Toothless's a lot more than just a pet dragon. he's Hiccup's best friend and they really show how complex the emotional bond between a person and an animal can really be. it was perfect in that sense. the only small gripe i got with the movie, it's that Drago could've been a little better as the villain. don't get me wrong, he's still a great new character and the movie does make him better as it goes. it's just that, when he first showed up, i was like \"This guy feels kinda weak\". that's just a small gripe, it's not enough to bring the movie down. honestly, i can't think of anything bad in \"How To Train Your Dragon 2\". it's the best animated sequel from DreamWorks we have, since \"Kung Fu Panda 2\". Dean DeBlois, i really hope you win the Oscar for this movie. you definitely deserve it! you gave us one of the best sequels in a really long time. i'm telling ya, Dean DeBlois knows what he's doing in every movie he makes. he gave us \"How To Train Your Dragon 1\" which was amazing. now, he gives us \"How To Train Your Dragon 2\" which is even better. i'm really excited for \"How To Train Your Dragon 3\", but i don't know how they're gonna top this one. this is the BEST animated movie of the year, and probably one of the best animated movies in a really long time. so, if you haven't seen it yet, go watch it. i swear to you, you're gonna love it.",

      "text": "How To Train Your Dragon 2 is a sequel that actually lives up to it's predecessor. It was what I was hoping for and more. The movies starts out with a Dragon competition with all the dragon riders. Astrid, Snotlout, Ruffnut, Tuffnut, and Fishlegs. At first you have no idea where Hiccup is. Once the competition is over we are now soaring through the sky with Toothless and Hiccup. Greeted with one of the best songs in the film. People talk about this movie not having heart, but it's just as big maybe even bigger than the first film. It will make you laugh and maybe even cry.  It had it's joyful moments and some sad moments too, but throughout it always was perfectly balanced. It was darker than than the first movie, but that's okay. I love that it tread on the dark side sometimes. Life has it's darker moments and that made this movie feel so real, even with dragons flying around. Toothless always brought a smile to your face, even during his vicious times. Without a cute dragon like Toothless the film might be too dark for younger kids, but since he is there he helps keep the film balanced perfectly. I say go see it as soon as you can if you even remotely like animated films. Bring your kids if you have any because they certainly won't be bored, and I don't think you will be either.",

      "text": "How to Train Your Dragon 2 is a mixed bag for me, on the one hand, its disjointed, annoying and preachy, but on the other its gorgeous, thought provoking and deep. It has many amazing shots and touching pieces of dialog, but it has just as many polar opposite moments. If I had to sum up my thoughts on this movie in one word, it would be disjointed. There are many amazing scenes in this movie, when Hiccups father is reunited with his wife it is truly touching and extremely emotional. But the surprisingly plentiful scenes of the girl twin swooning over arin son arit son of arene son of Arathorn, is strait up stupid, its totally disconnected from the tone of the rest of the movie and was clearly thrown in there because every family movie needs to have comic relief characters. Ugh, actually the friends in general, aside from Astrid, are painfully stupid to watch. They don\u2019t add to the story and they do not need to exist, why are they even such main characters in this movie? You could have had just Hiccup, Astrid, Stoic, and hiccups mom be the main characters, it\u2019s really baffling. And while you\u2019re at it, add Gobber to the list. He is probably the worst offender aside from the twin girl. When he interrupts the scene where Stoic and Hiccups mom are singing to each other just pulls me out of the scene every time. He completely breaks up the scene and it feels completely separate from what we are experiencing. In the first movie he was the kids mentor and he taught them and the audience about dragons, but here\u2026 he\u2019s just pointless! Except for creating laughs for the kiddies to giggle at, and that\u2019s not a character. I don\u2019t care about Gobber when him and Stoic are going after Hiccup, I care about STOIC! Gobber is one dimensional and not funny\u2026 to me anyways. *sighs* and all of these points can be put towards the twin girl and the rest of the friends as well. Its funny they actually have a resolution for the two guys trying to impress the twin girl, like what the heck? Why should I care about that? Short answer, I don\u2019t. Its jarring compared to what\u2019s actually happening and it just pulls me out of the movie and leaves me wishing they were just eradicated from the whole movie. And if they did that, then it woulda been like 20 minutes shorter!",

In the second book, she's abandoned all that ambition and spends most of the movie doting on Hiccup.  She identifies now seemingly as nothing more than his future wife and has hardly any lines.  That was disappointing.  They did introduce another major female character, but she was nowhere near the inspiration that Astrid had been.  Similarly, the lessons from the first movie, to see past our prejudices, are nowhere to be found.  The story is muddled, and the jokes don't work nearly as well.

We often are caught up in epic fantasy so long as it resembles The Lord of the Rings or Game of Thrones, but hope is kindle when a movie like this comes out. It is difficult to have a sequel that was an improvement in pretty much every way from the first but they figured out how to do it. Each character was given attention and care to their development and delivery to the plot and dialogue. The world of dragons and their personalities was widely expanded as well as their relationship with humans. With such powerful creatures susceptible to human rule, it was only a matter of time before a big bad guy came along to pit dragons on each other along with the rest of the known world. Hiccup and his friends have to prove themselves against impossible odds and the fury of open war. But they find help in unexpected places. This movie kept it thrilling and adventurous but it did not slack on the emotion. You laugh, gasp, and even cry when you see this while not missing out on the fun of it all. It is hard enough to make a movie this well put together. I felt like there was a pretty quick pace, not really leaving any time for collection, but given that this movie is intended for younger viewers, it was the better move to maintain constant attention throughout with big moving scenes, one after the other. Well done. Animated movies often stay on their own plain but, I think this time they broke through and gave some of the good movies this year a run for their money, period. Worth a watch.",

Hiccup in the second film is more conscious than ever as he finds his mother; in here we see that the film is actually growing from a childish film to a mature yet darkly dramatized film.

How to Train Your Dragon 2 takes every aspect of the original and makes it better, from the character development to the action to the visuals to the humor to the drama to the subject matter.

It has beautiful CGI, in all the technological aspects it looks really good, but besides that, this movie has as a surprise that is not only for kids, but for adults too because the film touches things mature enough for them.

It's hard to keep the small ones, the teenagers and the adults happy all at the same time but I think Dreamworks make a good shake at it..",
