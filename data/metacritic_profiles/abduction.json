This would be a good thing if this film was a comedy. John Singleton brings an action film so terrible it crosses into spoof territory with a lead actor (Taylor Lautner) who is thoroughly repulsive (at least acting wise). Singletons desire to make a fast paced action film which calls back to older films just reminds the viewer that the older films were so much better. As his first lead role away from The Twilight Saga, Lautner flops like a fish on dry land. He fails to tell the difference between acting and annunciation. The film suffers from other things but the score pretty much says it all. Its a shambles of a movie which everyone involved should be ashamed of, especially Lautner.",

Taylor Lautner's acting range is still very limited so I'm not sure how many more lead roles he'll get in mainstream cinema. He's still young so he could still become an impressive action star because he's got the skill set for it in terms of fighting and athletic ability but if his acting doesn't improve he'll just be another of the bunch. The rest of the cast did a solid job though and the action sequences were done well. Lautner doing his own stunts helped in that area. The story, while not necessarily unique, still developed well.

It`s worth watching, but mostly if you don`t have other options. Also worth watching, if you love teen romance. I watched it for free on Demand I think this is why I don`t hate it as much as some other people lol If I payed for I think I would be pretty mad lol",

      "text": "In my opinion \"Abduction\" was a great movie. The main points that were the highlight of this movie was the script, the acting and the direction. The script was very well put together. The words flowed together and made the whole movie seem real. The script showed the hurt and distrust that Nathan had for everyone around him. For example, \u201cTrust needs to be earned\u201d was said throughout the entire movie. The script also helps the plot out by showing the intensity of the movie. You weren't really sure what was going to happen next, which was the main point of the movie I believe. For example, when Nathan finds out that the \u201cparents\u201d he had been living with his whole life turn out to not be his actual parents he has to find out how to deal with this. He also sets out on a mission to find out who his real parents which involved a lot of distrust of people, fighting and confusion.The acting was very well put together. The way Nathan showed his emotions helped me to respond to the movie emotionally in a way of understanding what it\u2019s like to not know who to trust and the hurt of not knowing the truth. Also, the smaller parts of the movie helped play out the movie. For example, Nathan\u2019s friend who helped him get the tickets to the baseball game and gave him everything else he needed was a huge part of the movie. Lastly, the direction of the film showed throughout the movie. Everything in the movie worked well together and it didn't look to me like anything was controlled or faked. I do believe that the film succeeded it\u2019s original purpose, to be suspenseful and keep the audience on their toes.",

The plot and writing are okay, and the transitions from scene to scene aren't so awkward, but the movie misses the mark more times than not.",
