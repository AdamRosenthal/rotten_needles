In this farcically lewd comedy, two men have the once in a lifetime opportunity to relive their pre-marital days, only to the expense and baggage of 20 years, a couple kids, and a rusty dating game that has been played in ages. With their newly-given priviledges, and desperate attempts via Applebee's, they finally reach what they sought after, albeit unlikely, sex with beautiful women. Only now, approached with such recognition, do they realize how lucky they really are to be married--- notwithstanding attractive women already at home. Aside from being offensively indecent and raunchy around the edges, \"Hall Pass\" is the projection of every man's fantasy, acted on or not, where being average is perceivably desirable, and insecurities are tossed aside. At the surface, you have a movie that will make you laugh to the limits of your waistline, mesmerize to every last 'mental image,' jump from every Jacuzzi, and have you another quote to share with your friends.",

      "text": "\"Hall Pass\", similar to the grossly underrated \"Shallow Hal\"(arguably the best title in this filmmaking brothers' oeuvre, \"There's Something About Mary\" notwithstanding) serves up mean-spirited jokes at the expense of women who aren't, to put it kindly, classically beautiful, and should probably have been best left alone, rather than have a camera overstate their lack of sex appeal. Maybe because Jack Black isn't classically beautiful himself, the 2001 film, in which a svelte Gwyneth Paltrow juxtaposes herself against a moribundly obese version of herself, somehow is able to get away with its aggressively misogynistic tone. This time, the filmmakers aren't so lucky. In the film's arena of sexual politics, not only are the women punished for their desires and transgression, but the men as well, which is better than your typical Adam Sandler offering, and yet, the level playing field this filmmaking duo purportedly advocates seems to be enacted, not as a corrective measure against double standards, but rather, as a license to get away with murder. \"Shallow Hal\", which featured the immortal line, \"Don't be satisfied with routine p**ntang,\" the dying words imparted by a grandfather to a young Hal, may have been, in retrospect, equally hateful towards women, in light of this somewhat thematically similar offering, which does a poorer job of covering its tracks. A film like Paul Weitz's \"American Pie\" was revolutionary in the sense that it depicted women with lax morals without them having to pay for their impertinent conduct through some corresponding humiliation. The women, clearly, were ahead of the men. Clearly, that's not the case here. All in all, \"Hall Pass\" has the same nineteenth century sensibility so typical of many genre films, reflecting the reactionary attitudes of the distant past in regard to women and sex, in which a respected intellectual(British Particular Baptist preacher Charles Haddon Spurgeon) could proclaim, \"When the goose drinks as deep as the gander, the pots are soon empty, and the cupboards are bare.\" In the film's pivotal moment, goose number one, Maggie(Jenna Fischer), the woman who instigated this whole mess, tells the baseball coach, a man she could f*ck right then and there, that \"this hall pass was never for him,\" the \"him\" being her husband with the wandering eye(played by Owen Wilson), as a set-up for the scene where the movie seemingly punishes Rick for wanting extra-marital physical relations, when the real estate agent comes home to what apparently sounds like Maggie taking liberties with the new rules. For the time being, the filmmaker encourages the moviegoer to loathe her. That slut, you think, and in spite of his unrealistic expectations(he misses Maggie's younger self), you side with him and visualize along with him, his wife's illicit lovemaking with the near-stranger behind that door. She's a mother of three, you think, that whore. That's the double standard. Female desire is no laughing matter, not like when Rick finds himself alone in a room with the hot girl who pours his coffee every morning at the cafe. The filmmaker throws the bare-breasted Aussie at Rick, implicitly as a reward for not getting intimate with his kids' nubile babysitter. Now that would be creepy, getting it on with a twenty-year-old, so by comparison, sex with Leigh(Nicky Whelan) would be relatively moral. But alas, Rick declines her offer, and then, sanctimoniously gives one of those patented speeches favored by the filmmaker in which the protagonist's inherent decency is supposed to cancel out all the rampant misogyny that preceded this sudden apologetic maneuver meant to placate the potentially offended female demographic. This salve against mean-spiritedness can't reconcile the grotesquerie that is the woman with the diarrhea. Unlike Rick and Maggie, Fred and Grace(played by Jason Sudeikis and Christina Applegate) do take full-advantage of their marital exemption, and the difference in tone as it pertains to their respective sanction infidelities, is calibrated, as such, in accordance with the bylaws of the double standard. When Fred has a one-night stand with a cougar, the chastening he gets from the filmmaker is tempered with comedy, as the older woman kicks him in the face, proceeded by gunfire, courtesy of the older woman's son. His transgression is treated as hijinks. It's a completely different story for Grace. Not surprisingly, she's not allowed to enjoy her once-in-a-lifetime fling, since her sex partner, just a pup, is inexperienced, but to make matters worse, the minor league pitcher eviscerates her by bring up their comparative ages, after Grace, believing she has the upper-hand, lets him down gently and is made to be the fool. The next time we see the woman, she's bawling in her car. As it turns out, she crashes. Both husband and wife have nearly matching scars, but why should the woman have to pay for her man's middle age crisis?",

Considering that this appears to be an attempt at a touching comedy with some moral undertones about marriage, it seems contradictory that the characters are unlikeable, self-obsessed and completely out-of-touch with everything going on around them. And nearing the final scenes, just when I thought it couldn't get any worse, we see irrational attempted murder and a stupid car chase (but at this point I guess the viewer probably doesn't care anymore).

      "text": "The movie succeeds in one area: the humor, despite being profane, juvenile, misogynistic, and somewhat disturbing at points, nonetheless hits the mark and leaves room for many thick and hearty laughs. On the other side, these moments of humor, though consistent, are surrounded by more dramatic moments, which become more tiresome than anything else. Ultimately the contrast between the drama and the comedy does not work. The actors are incapable of truly dramatic acts and the point that the Farrelly Brothers attempts make  falls to pieces and is almost unidentifiable amongest the sexual humor that pervades throughout. If the script was better written and Wilson and Sudeikis were more than simple comedians, then maybe the film would have been able to take whatever point the Farrelly Brothers were trying to make and actually convey it to the audience. But the truth of the matter is that this film shows us one thing and makes us believe with all out hearts. Owen Wilson needs to stick to comedy and purely comedy, nothing else. But in the end, when I think back to this film, the jokes still stick in my head and I ultimately have to call this a funny and decent movie.",

      "text": "Thanks to this film, the term, \"Hall Pass\", became part of the modern urban vernacular, and while the term was a big success, the movie was not. For some reason, Hollywood film makers continue to think that Owen Wilson is funny, and maybe he is, but personally, I don't see it. I usually just wind up feeling sorry for whatever loser character he's portraying. In this film, Wilson and Jason Sudeikis play two guys who have been married awhile, and are starting to get bored. After seeing mutual friends of theirs divorce, the couples worry that they're headed down the same path. Thanks to some friendly advice from Joy Behar, the wives decide that the men should get a week off from marriage to do what they want, and the rest of the film, follows their antics in trying to pick up women after being out of the game for such a long time. The premise of the film isn't terrible and usually, Jason Sudeikis is pretty funny, but Hall Pass falls flat on it's face. This is supposed to be a comedy, so why does it take nearly an hour for the story to get to the point? By the time the guys are shopping for dates, I was bored and pretty much done with this film. In the second hour, the film does get a little better, but not nearly enough. Owen Wilson and Jason Sudeikis are just two very different types of comedic actors and their styles didn't mesh well at all. If anything their antics together were more stupid than funny, and if there's one thing I can't stand when it comes to comedy, it's stupidity that leads nowhere. It was a good idea, but the writing wasn't very good, the actors didn't mesh, and the situations just weren't that extreme or funny. Hall Pass is just another forgettable film that fails to live up to expectations.",
