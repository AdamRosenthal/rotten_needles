How many times have we seen that before? It\u2019s just so dumb, anything you can predict that is going to happen based on previous similar films, happens; there\u2019s no one single unexpected twist, and there\u2019s absolutely nothing new. The script is very laughable at. They don\u2019t even bother in explaining why the main character is so special. The only reason they give to us is because he is the seventh son of a seventh son (and another stupid reason that I don\u2019t want to spoil), and that\u2019s it. I don\u2019t even know what Jeff Bridges, Julianne Moore and Djimon Hounsou were doing there, but it\u2019s definitively bad for their curriculum.",

I simply do not understand the bad user ratings, unless there is some attempt to appear sophisticated by aping the critics, who don't review movies with the same approach us average users do.  I make my judgements based on whether the movie justified my admission fees.  This movie did so.  The special effects were, as is so common now, flawless.  The acting was good, and the plotline explained what this user needed to know of the backstory.  I give it a solid 8 out of 10 as a good action adventure romp that provides a good release from the cares and stress of daily life.  I recommend keeping an open mind and giving this one a try.  It's sure better than \"Black Sea,\" which left me wanting to ask for a refund.",

This movie brings light upon a new set of fantasy. It is about a boy named Tom Ward who is chosen to aid the spook because he is the seventh son of the seventh son and on that journey he must fight creatures sent by the evil witch that wishes to gain all this power from the blood moon. First off people can not go into the movie expecting Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings this is mainly because Seventh Son is its own thing. From I have seen in other reviews they did not understand the story for some reason, but I promise if you have half a brain you would fully understand. The reason I am rating this a 9 is mainly because through out the movie there was this character that I thought annoying but besides that everything was pretty darn awesome. The effects and action scenes were awesome. Also, from what I know it is supposed to be a book series so I will be very excited to see a sequel to this film. I do not know why this movie has been trashed on and I know this one review will not stop that but I promise who ever reads this if you are on actual fan of Fantasy or Action you will enjoy this movie, and I forgot to mention that I saw this movie in IMAX and was completely amazed at how amazing the movie was with the 3D and amazing sound system. So, if you find yourself at the movies and do not really know what to watch I highly suggest this movie, I say watch it in IMAX but if you do not have the money that is completely understandable, I hope my review helps in your final decision to watching the movie.",
