Mr. Hader and Ms. Wilg, comic partners from Saturday Night Live, prove the point. This is a film that tells the story of two siblings and the effect their childhood upbringing has on their adulthood. It is not an easy film to watch for it paints a picture of 2 troubled human beings and how each, in his and her own way, attempts to cope with the demons that continue to haunt them from their unhappy past to the present.
