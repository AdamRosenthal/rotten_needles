For me, it's probably the best, most artistic action film since the original Matrix. Furiosa (Charlize Theron) is clearly the best heroine since Ripley in the Alien films. Going in, I figured the action would be fatiguing, and the desert backdrop would get samey after a while, but I couldn't have been more wrong on both counts. Miller's inventiveness knows know bounds. If I had to point to a slightly weak link in the chain, it would be the Immortan Joe character. No doubt, he's fun to look at and provides some of the comedy, but as a character, he is not nearly as personally threatening as the chief baddies in the original Mad Max and Road Warrior flicks.  But the supreme creativity and the acrobatics in the driving sequences are so over-the-top phenomenal, you'll be conscious of the silly grin on your face when things finally let up and you allow yourself to exhale.",

I could generate a list of 100 ways this is ridiculous (like if bullets and gas were in limited supply, why is everyone shooting guns and flamethrowers into the sky?) I truly felt nothing for these characters and was quite glad when it ended (with the \"good guys\" just dumping all the water into the desert!).

Isn't this ending a slap in the face of feminism, as portrayed in this film? Women couldn't do it on their own so they took what a man created, but they are going to make it a better, gentler place? Don't get me started on the symbolism of the hot wives, in the desert, spraying themselves with the second most important liquid in this fantasy world, water , spilling it all over, drinking it , spitting it out.

Mad Max gets taken very easily taken by a raiders gang ( you know the guy that has survived the wastelands for decades) and proceeds to be taken prisoner by a gang that are incapable of being the least bit articulate or show any intelligence. Yet they are somehow able to build and maintain various cars able to produce agriculture, make elaborate costumes, manipulate and control it's citizens and be organized enough to create a functioning society with working technology. I won't even mention how the way blood is transfused in this is impossible and wouldn't really work. Also the environment and costumes in this movie makes no sense what there is no resources left but you can make all of these elaborate costumes and machines. There were scenes in this movie where I literally had to stop myself from laughing like the breastfeeding scenes with plastic tubes and then cut to a midget in a highchair with a telescope. But to be honest the only reason anyone likes this film is because of the action which to be fair is really good but there is only so much bad one dimensional characters and silly character design I can handle before something is too stupid too watch.",

Mad Max certainly doesn't have a lot of one of those. If you wrote down all of Tom Hardy's dialogue, it would roughly be the length of a couple of greeting cards. He takes after the Terminator, in T-2. Only interested in completing his goals, working with the few words he needs. Until of course he comes across people who don't speak in grunts, and he must expand his vocabulary. The great things about this movie is that it knows how you are suppose to use CGI for action sequences. Most action movies feel that bigger is better, and immediately construct a 30 story metal larva eating the Himalayas. I know computer animation takes a lot of work and takes enormous effort, but the sods who make animators go through all this are the ones I blame. Mad Max: Fury Road understands that CGI is the frosting on the cake. Making every bit of car crash feel more crisp, which works because they actually made a car crash first. If you just make a car crash using nothing but CGI, you are just making your cake with nothing but frosting. Yes we all like frosting but what's wrong with the cake batter you were using Michael Bay.",

Why was so much risked and lost over these women? See, this movie created a smoke screen of fast paced action, flash, and flare, without actually creating anything profound.

Beside, the movie is called Mad Max, but really the main hero is Furiosa, Max is just a secondary puppet that helps her, because she's hot and she travels with a bunch of supermodels. Ok, visually was good, but the movie has the overall depth of a tampons commercial... Also, for the first time, it was OBVIOUS that the actors re-dubbed themselves.",

The special effects and action was great and who doesn't love a post apocalypse setting? But this movie suffers from very boring characters who were both uninteresting and poorly developed. I never cared for the Max himself, in fact, I rank the old movies as average or below, but the other characters were very 1 dimensional and I just didnt care what happens one way or another. The movie reminded me of Transformers, lots of pointless action and no heart (just replace cgi with live action). Overall, I would never watch this movie again so its slightly below average to me (remember, 5 is mathematically average on Metacritic).",

This is because most of the movies I watched previously only appears really interesting in the trailer but not in real premiere. However, this one totally blew me off. It is super duper cool and worth it! I haven't watched previous Mad Max series and when I heard that since this is going to be a sequel to past Mad Max series, I thought I wouldn't understand the plot but it turns out there's not much to understand anyway. The plot is straightforward although there are some parts which leaves me into question but I guess I might need to refer that to past series. Anyway to be honest the plot is just normal to me but I do give top marks for the action of this movie. I mean this is literally a full action movie. Right from the beginning to the end there's always action scenes which leaves the audience in awe and I think with this kind of movie, the plot don't mind that much to me. This movie is like the apocalypse version of Fast and Furious and for gamers who have played apocalyptic games, this reminds me a lot about games such as Rage or Twisted Metal. I would love to see another sequel to this!",

Other strong female characters who did it right were the love interest in Raiders of the Lost ark, and the young girl from the new True Grit remake.",

Though  I have not seen the first three, I opted to see this one due to the great word of mouth and ultimately, I was incredibly satisfied. With an absolutely riveting world created that seems vast and unique in nature, Fury Road feels just like an epic action film should. Tom Hardy, Charlize Theron, and Nicholas Hoult, are all fantastic, especially Hoult who really steals the show at times. The makeup is great and completely convincing. However, the real star here for me was the beautiful cinematography (which is gorgeous btw) and phenomenal special effects, which were the definition of perfection. The car chases featured both very well, which is why those scenes were undoubtedly my favorite and probably some of the most exhilarating and well plotted car chases I have seen in a film. Truly a great action film, if I was an action junkie, this would be a 10/10, but I am not. All the same, this is still a great film that provides all the heart stopping action and thrills that it should.",

However, the happy ending and the general tone of the film, apart from one twist that is surprising enough, are not dark and bitter as they should for such a movie, and for such a setting. The title \"Mad Max\" is somewhat misleading, the true heroin of the story being Furiosa, who makes all the important decisions and has way more character development than Max. But that's not really a problem, since he doesn't seem to have a lot of personality. Anyway, Mad Max is one helluva show, and probably one of the best action flicks I've seen for a long time.",

I'm not even sure that the main character IS max as his random, nonsensical flashbacks can't even be tied to any of the previous films. The visuals were wonderful, the cinematography great, and the action was above average, for sure, but it takes more than that to make a great action film. See the aforementioned Road Warrior, Terminator 2 (or Terminator 1), Aliens, Predator, The Matrix. All those movies had gripping plots, intense suspense, good builds, great character development, in addition to amazing visuals and top notch action. All classics. People try to tell me that this movie was about 'visual storytelling'. Sure, it had that. But it was like a few tiny pieces of meat on a mostly bare skeleton. This movie had the FEEL of classic mad max but none of the soul. Is this what american cinema has come to these days? Just how dumb and easily pleased is the average critic and metacritic user?

      "text": "Mad Max Fury Road is a lot of insane, over the top car chases, mad characters and with brilliant action and over the top stunt work.  So basically another Mad Max film!! But I\u2019m gonna go out on a limb and say this one\u2019s my new favourite If you liked the previous entries, this is definitely one you should check out.  George Miller is on fantastic form with this film and it\u2019s amazing to think it took him this long to re-capture it.  Tom Hardy is well cast in his role, though I do believe Nicholas Hoult is the best actor in the whole film and both of them complement Charlize Theron\u2019s performance very well.  There is never a dull moment, the characters are really good and I actually think this would be a pretty good jumping on point for newcomers.  I would recommend seeing the first two movies prior to seeing this and some long time fans may be a bit confused by some elements that have been added to the film, mainly Max\u2019s flashbacks.  This is absolutely brilliant, though be warned there is a bit of a gore factor at points, though it\u2019s not to the extent that it will be absolutely wince inducing. Many people are calling this the best action movie of the last 5 years and while I personally still think that honour belongs to the Avengers this is still a contender for that title.",

I mean if this film does not click with the audience and flops, that means it\u2019s not the filmmakers\u2019 fault, it\u2019s the audience that will spell the end of innovating, original, fresh daring, bold blockbusters like these, which are already impossible to make in this day and age. To say this is the movie of the year would be an understatement, it\u2019s quite simply a stunning work of art, filled with impressionistic visual splendour that stuns you from beginning to end. George Miller proves why he\u2019s a master filmmaker when it comes to staging epic stunts and, of course, chase sequences. And it wouldn\u2019t be an overestimation if I deem Fury Road (2015) superior to Road Warrior (1981) and as the best of the Mad Max series. This one takes the cake for being the must watch movie of the year; one that demands to be seen only on the biggest IMAX screen you can find. For once the hype and the reviews more than lived up to expectations. Action and blockbuster cinema simply does not get better than this, the bar has been set very high.",

Fury Road is that extremely rare example of a movie that blew expectations away wholly.  I'll admit that I wasn't expecting too much from this, as the trailers made it seem like just another brain-dead action film; in my defense a thousand dumb as hell action movies come out every year, and the fact that this was a reboot didn't help mitigate that assumption.  But I could not have been more wrong.  An action film with an emphasis on practical effects, great acting, writing, directing, and an actual message is about as rare on Earth as kryptonite.  This movie is gorgeous visually (definitely watch it on the best quality TV possible), but the sound is on a whole other level; seriously, listen to this on a high-quality surround sound setup and prepare to be blown away.  I don't want to spoil anything, but there is one scene in the movie that takes place in a sandstorm; this is one of the greatest moments of cinema I have ever had the fortune of experiencing.  It is a perfect marriage of visuals and sound and is a feast for the senses; buy this movie for that one scene alone, but enjoy the rest of the movie as well, because it is amazing.  It is filmed mainly as one long chase, and it is pedal to the metal fast right from the get-go.  Fast is the only speed this film knows.  Anyway, this film has gotten massive critical acclaim and definitely deserves some award recognition in the coming months (even though the likeliness of anything like the Academy recognizing it is akin to Hitler still being alive).  It is far and away the best film I've seen this year, and I can only hope that its future sequels, which are already in early development, are worthy of this masterpiece of sight and sound.  If I had only one word to describe this movie, it would be \"insane\"; not in a bad way, but in the \"you have no Idea what's going to happen next\" way, and that's exactly what I want from art.",

The relentless pace and virtually non-stop clashes are sometimes so hectic that it's hard to figure out what's happening. The thick accents and noisy sound sometime make the dialogue a challenge, but it doesn't really matter. The massive soundtrack by Junkie XL adds another level of intensity.

Real action, crazy stunts, a lunatic hellish world, memorable characters, and even more surprising a touching score that accents the action to its dizzying heights but also quite moving in the quiet moments.  Yes the movie does belong to Furiosa..so get used it..she belongs with the other greats such as Ripley and Sarah Connors (T2 Sarah).  This is action er that offers something different than the what we have been used to, mainly CGI superhero slugfests..and I still enjoy those, but there is something deeply primal that is missing from those movies and this movie is the definition of primal action at its best.",

The main plot has a great premise, if a bit flimsy and sort of falls apart with plot holes near the end, but has a mature theme. The movie is filled with interesting and bizarre characters. One thing that I found was interesting  is that max doesn't really seem to be the main character, although he is a lead. The main character seems like Furiosa, the female lead. Most of the movie revolves around her actions, shes acted and portrayed perfectly. Furiosa is one of the best female character leads of all time. She's not afraid to get her hands dirty and takes the punishment of her actions and from others really well and always seems to come on top in the long run.

Sure, there's spectacular explosions, a phlethora of scrap metal vehicles + some really weird characters indeed. The story itself is paper thin (even for Mad Max movies), almost non-existent really. No character in the film has any depth, with some sort of exception of Charlize Theron's character. Max Rockatansky mainly serves as a punching bag in this movie and only catches a few rays of limelight that bounce off Furiosa (Theron). For this reason alone the movie title seems all wrong: it's way more about Furiosa than it is about Max. The film itself seems like one big car chase through the desert wasteland with some \"king-of-the-hill\" fighting sequences intermixed. The ending is typical \"leave room for a sequel\". And yes, Mad Max The Wasteland has already been announced: no sense of at least some sort of episode closure whatsoever.",

As a matter of fact, I was actually pretty conflicted on whether I loved or hated it up until about a third of the way through the movie.  The opening scene felt a little sudden and underplayed and some of the early concepts had me worried that the whole movie might turn into one big cliche.  But after the initial rush of excitement started to die down, Hardy and Theron's phenomenal acting prowess subtly emerged and really made the movie shine.  Truly gripping moments, both horrible and touching raised the bar and the supporting cast made real contributions to the story instead of just being background noise.  No, there wasn't much in the way of  any sort of back story and yes, the movie was virtually a 2 hour long chase but I really can't say that I feel that either of these facts detract from the film.  While I'm generally not a fan of this particular style, Miller plunged into this movie and never hit the brakes yet excelled on virtually all fronts.",

Later on you are introduced to the villains but not introduced to anything overly about them you know the immortal but you don't know anything else about him. The movie lacked any background and after the film I thought I may have missed something in the other movies so after re watching them to find out none of it ties into this sequel and was still left with unanswered question and the obvious \"why didn't they just kill the bad guy at the start\" once the villain dies it as if all his followers allow the city to be taken over by the villagers. The motive of why they are trying to escape the villain is only stated as him mistreating them and he desires them for healthy children. The part when you find out there is no green land and she falls to her knees and cries has no impact as you don't get any sense of past with the character you get no information of her homeland and why it was so important to bring them there. Not to mention Tom Hardy spends the first part of the film looking like Bane and sounding like a illiterate grunting moron and not the justice seeking, intelligent and experienced fire fighter Mel Gibson plays. This was a chance to continue what fans loved and I feel it didn't come up to pass",

Fury Road is pure excellent filmmaking, the visuals are off the charts, the acting by Charlize Theron may be her absolute best and the stunts are bloodcurdling fun. The story starts out with Max (Tom Hardy), a former cop, who gets abducted by War Boys, skinny looking minions of Immortan Joe, to be their \"blood bank\". He ends up being a blood bank for Nux (Nicholas Hoult), a brainwashed War Boy. The story entwines with the story of Furiosa (Charlize Theron) who involves Max's escape into HER plan to take tortured girls put of Immortan Joe's captivity, to a place where mankind will thrive, the place where she was born. For the rest of the runtime, experiance Joe's minions getting in their way, for a long car chase, that glued me to my seat for some heart pumping, bloody thrills. Acting wise, Hardy makes a good Max, he has the hint that Mel Gibson had  in the previous movies. The real kick is Theron, a fearless warrior, she has a dark past attached to her and the movie adapts to her story in her way as well. Hoult as Nux is not short of its kick as well. Mad Max has come a long way, Miller has crafted a new path for the Mad Max Universe, with some really interesting weird characters and Furiosa's story has more to it. But for what we have now, this is a standalone masterpiece,  easily the best in the series. Fury Road puts all other acrion movies to shame. I hope Miller brings us another venture into a dark, crazy wasteland. He is a man of his word, this is a masterpeice. DONT MISS IT.",

There is not a thick plot but you quickly forget that once you are submersed into the Mad Max world and you can't escape until the chase is over and you've realized you drank your entire soda, urinated yourself in the theater, and you were so glued to the screen you didn't realize it. Certain movies come around every so often and they evoke emotions that you remember from past movies that you remember exactly when and where you experienced it.  Movies like Jurassic Park and The Matrix just to name a few. They changed the way movies were made. I hope Mad Max is that movie for new films. The practical stunts and the minimum use of CGI is what Hollywood needs to do. Work on finding a good balance between the two so I actually feel fear for on screen characters.

Aside from that 1 second peeve, I can't stop thinking about the film in my head. There are so many parallels to societies that the film becomes somewhat of a social commentary as well. Lastly what ties it all together is the soundtrack. Each scene is accompanied by a track that makes you feel like you are there and made me want to go out and be productive post-film. The OST really captured the immense and powerful vibes emitted by every scene in this sweet ass work of art.

Overall, this was very entertaining and I look forward to future installments. The negatives were that Charlize Theron has way too large of a role. Even in the trailer and promotional posters, she's clearly the star. Does this hurt the film? Not necessarily but it feels unnecessary. The story should've focused more on Max. We got almost no backstory for his character whatsoever and he maybe speaks a dozen lines. The other element that was a weak point was that some of the scenes were a bit too ridiculous. I expect some of it but not to the extent where you have a guy standing on top of a vehicle traveling at high speeds through the desert while playing an electric guitar with flames coming out of the tip.

As others have said, basically a two hour chase scene.  Yes, the vehicles and stunts are creative and impressive to look at and the director does a masterful job with all the visuals.  Still, the bare bones plot which exists is incomprehensible, and I'm familiar with the back story.  Can't see how you would have any idea what's going on without that prior knowledge.  While there is at least minimal character development with Furiosa, there is almost none for Max.  Neither actor does much acting, unless you consider endless angry, brooding looks as acting.  Check out The Revenant to see a fabulous current performance from Hardy, and Monster for an acting tour de force from Theron, then compare that work with this.  Seeing this movie garner 10 nominations made me think there must be something special, but now I'm just dumbfounded at the Academy voters.",

But, beware there is no deep story or dialogue, mad max rarely talks or drives his car.  The movie is all about Charlize and driving from point A to point B and then back to point A again.  Once you realize this, you get bored.  it is really just a bunch of people trying to stop a truck from driving to its destination, not enough unique visuals or gore to keep you interested though.",

For a movie with lighter dialogue and amped-up action sequences that will blow anything Michael Bay could ever hope to achieve out of the water, Mad Max has a bit of heart (though it's still somewhat light for plot and character development - only offering what you need to buy into the movie) .  It's gloriously over the top but somehow remains somewhat visceral.  The magic is happening as the result of well-crafted action sequences that progress appropriately, instead of throwing all sorts of extra obstacles and insanity \"just because\".  Everything is focused and paced well, and I really enjoyed that about MM.  While the first half of the movie is entertaining, it's the final half hour that really had me on the edge of my seat.  I'm not certain there's supposed to be any other Mad Max movies to follow this reboot, but they'll have to work wonders to top the action bar set here.",

The acclaim that this movie has received is undeserved, as it is just like any other action movie out there, it does nothing special. The times that the movie does take a turn from the two hour long car chase are pretty mediocre with unconvincing acting all around, really.

This movie seem to do well in the character development department and the dialog was minimal but it complimented the films feel. Tom Hardy was a great Max and has portrayed Max in a very honest way. The only thing stopping me from giving it the full 10 out of 10 is that the film feels like it is more about Furiosa and not Max. I think the film needed a little more Max and I'm not saying that he needs more character development or he needs to talk more. I think that would have made the film worse, but I think it should have felt more like we were watching Max help Furiosa on her journey but I felt as if we were watching Furiosa's journey. It is still a very action packed thrill ride with very good effects that are visually stimulating and exciting. This is a movie that has a lot to offer. It is a must see and it is executed very well. Go spend your money on it.",

Im reading perfect reviews scores from so many critics that I wonder A) How do you get a job? B) Who are you writing for? The reader or the studios C) Are you giving it higher scores bcos you want to see more of the rebooted franchise? Clearly there is money involved. This looks good on screen, its Max, it has George Millers style dripping throughout, but all said and done its not a great movie. I was excited, the early screenings were received with applause, so impressed were the studios they gave Miller $14mill to go back add more explosions, more stunts..What Rubbish!! they were given $14million to buy the reviews of critics to cover over the complete lack of storyline, plot or character development. Make no mistake, this is marketing branding vehicle, like Hunger Games, totally purchased reviews. A pay day movie to the media sites and reviewers. They know this, play ball, perpetrate the myth. Charlise is there cos Max is wooden, maybe if he actually displayed some MAD qualities. His instincts, his battle with the crazies out there that took killed his family, the road warrior surviving the highways in his V8 Interceptor. No instead they blow up it in first 5mins of movie so he can travel on the venga bus/truck whatever. There is very little buy in, you dont feel the drama, the tension cos you know the result. It just tries to fill that 2hrs with distractions and stunts of crazies biting the dust that you care little about.Its the shallow surfaceness thats the problem. Theres no twists, no surprises, and lacks the characters of the original, or the comraderie of Max & Gyro Capt found in Mad Max 2. The crazies have about as much menace as Thunderdome. I saw Mad Max 2 with my brother 30yrs ago we came out of that movie amped. That was a classic. Max motivations were real. The threat was real, so then the drama was real, you bought into who would live and die. When Hollywood gonna learn? Charlize Theron is too well known, so theres never any threat to her. You know she will be there as will Max at the end of the movie. This ranks 3rd of the Max franchise, as nothings as bad as Thunderdome, however its still completely mindless and missing the soul of the first two. The reviews above 70 are generous, those in 80s need to get real.. The 90 to 100 scores hahaha you have been bought!! This is not a masterpiece. Do your bloodyy job. Sorry George Miller as an Aussie I want you to successfully reboot Max, but not like this. Make a quality Max, your last 2 efforts are diminishing the franchise. Its becoming a joke.",

The very intense and busy action sequences were easy to follow, not confusing blurs as so many are these days, and the human (collateral?) damage was not overdone (no slow motion with torrents of blood).  The trailers do prepare you for MM:FR, except for the subjective length of this very long 2 hour movie.",

I watched somebody watch this on the little screen they stick on the back of airplane seats for long, cheap international flights. What the hell? Are you reliving the storyline so you can untangle some of the more complicated plot points (oh, that scene had 37 explosions, 2 were very subtle)? Are you soaking in all that rich character development (yes there is some, but stop acting like that\u2019s revolutionary just because it\u2019s better than would have been bad)? Did you accidentally see Confessions of a Shopaholic and just immediately need to burn the experience out of your veins? No, fellow traveler, you probably just love it so much that you would watch it on a **** if Apple would only let you, basking in the memory of all that blistering sight and sound while squinting against the glare on the morning train. I grew up with Mad Max. I wore out my bootleg Road Warrior tape when I got chicken pox. This is a different Mad Max in nearly every way, but it\u2019s also a better one. I take it as a reboot. That makes things cleaner. There is maybe a 5% chance a sequel will be half as good or more than this new original\u2014so revel in it while you can. And if you meet someone who doesn\u2019t like it, don\u2019t get on their case. They are weak, they have a condition, they don\u2019t have the constitution for your impression of a War Rig.",

At 70, I guess George had one more Mad Max episode left in home, but  this was nothing more than a an utterly incomprehensible wild romp.  Fury Road is nothing more than a video game brought to the screen with its threadbare plot, not to mention clothing on our five fetching damsels in distress, on which the plot loosely hinges like their chastity belts.  What little story there is might be seen as poetic in a post-apocalyptic sort of way.  I have to hand it to Charlize Theron for trying to rise above the horribly malevolent nature of this film and give us some sense of hope in the arid violent future George Miller imagines.  However, even she couldn't save this film from itself.  There were some moments of dark humor, such as the aging biker chic gang, the last to hold onto the seeds of a Utopian dreamworld.  The only suspense was whether this green world still existed, but apparently the only thing left was one desolate tree that didn't look strong enough to pull a dune buggy much less a war rig out of the quagmire.  I guess it had very deep roots.  It's just an inglorious ride through the Australian outback with some wild-eyed visual effects along the way, as if George has been dabbling in magic mushrooms.  It's fun to a point, but the sad part is you really don't care what happens to anyone in this movie.",

Furiosa is a very well rounded character and isn't just put in there to make the feminist crowed happy. George Miller wanted to create a believable character that happened to be a woman, not the other way around. She was defiantly treated as a person first and a woman second. The only complaint I have for the movie is that I would have liked for the main villain to have been more flushed out, but he isn't as bad as some movie villains these days. Everyone had a reason for being there, and the story works well because of it. All and all, Mad Max: Fury Road, will leave you satisfied while wanting more. 9/10.",

The original Mad Max was uniquely odd and the second film, if memory serves correctly, was exciting if a tad more conventional. Beyond Thunderdome was just a disaster. A copper bottomed clinker that had Tina Turner appear for novelty value in addition to a load of dishevelled snotty nosed brats. This combination ensured thatt the turn off was complete. Thankfully, Fury Road is considerably better than that debacle, but is some way behind the earlier two instalments and is certainly not worthy of the euphoric reviews and praise that have been heaped upon it by both the critics and public, singing in unison for once it would appear. Production values are sound and it must be said that visually the film is an absolute delight. John Seale\u2019s cinematic compositions for day and night are constantly impressive and there is one corker of a moment when what looks like a sand dune suddenly metamorphosis\u2019s into Max (Tom Hardy). There is also much stylisation in the battle scenes with jump cuts adding immeasurably to the impact and editing that moves along at the rate of knots. The sound is another strong plus and whilst there is plenty of appropriate menace in the score one is unprepared for just how beautiful the music is here.",

Its made to show just how to do it in terms of practical bombastic effects, and that CGI should be used to add to already great stunts instead of BEING the stunts in themselves. You will be hard pressed not to say 'awesome silliness' when the guitar guy shows up for the first time. If you like action, have a thing for vehicular mayhem, and enjoy the fallout/rage/borderlands wasteland settings, this is for you.",

I'm not saying it's some revolutionary story here, but the plot is at least as good if not better than the previous Mad Max movies. This is not drama, this is action at it's finest.

It may not have the most thought provoking plot, the most mind bending twists, or the most intricately crafted story. However, when you go to see a movie, you come in with some expectation of what you are about to see. I didn't expect that with this movie. This movie showed me something different, that there is a different way. There is a different way to make movies where artistry and orchestration of a million tons of steel and a trillion tons of sand can combine to tell a story on its own. Where absolutely no camera shots or words are wasted. Where every single frame plays together to create a masterpiece of visual and active story telling. Where every second of dead air hangs thick with anticipation. This movie is a circus; George Miller is laughing as he takes apart expectation and he shreds action movie tropes, only to have something truly original and important come out the other side. The most original, daring, and inventive movie in 30 years is an installment in a 30-year-old franchise. That is the cosmic irony and beautiful existence of Mad Max: Fury Road.

The plot is meaningless, simple and at one point becomes incoherent; the worst thing is that George Miller tries to hide it with an opulent artillery of explosions. It\u2019s true that action cinema is all about that, but what makes an action movie stand out from the rest is the thing that sustains the significance of the explosions and fights. Mad Max is indisputably a technical achievement, highlighting the make-up; this and Charlize Theron are definitely the only good items in the feature.",

The music is a massive improvement over Brian May's and Maurice  Jarre's crimes against musical humanity, but Tom Hardy has about as much charisma as a turnip. As a straight-up action film, it's watchable and holds interest, and is certainly better than the anschluss of super-hero movies currently stinking up the marquees with no sign of relief.
