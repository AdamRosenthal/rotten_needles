In a way, Martha does change. There are a series of flashbacks that show her happy and carefree as she settles into the cult of a sex crazed looney. Then we see her psychologically damaged after she's escaped and living with her sister. But the movie establishes these two sides of Martha early on and very little is done in the end to give us a complete picture of who Martha is as a person. I also didn't care too much for the outcome of her character. While Elizabeth Olsen gives a knockout debut performance, I found her character to be very self-centered and foolish. First, she was stupid to have joined the cult and believe all of the stupid babble the leader spewed on her. Then she refuses to even hint at what happened to her with her sister. I understand that a person would have a hard time opening up about traumatic events, but they at least need to understand that she's been through some messed up times. She never lets them know. It becomes very frustrating to deal with. Then to top it all off, the movie ends at a random point. I felt like I went through enough trouble in this film to get some kind of conclusion, but the movie leaves us with none. I saw a lot of similarities between \"Martha Marcy May Marlene\" and \"Take Shelter,\" but the biggest differences for me were the characters and execution. The characters in \"Take Shelter\" were compelling enough that it could end on a cliffhanger and get away with it. The characters in \" Martha\" on the other hand, were rather unlikable. Also, the ending is beautifully executed in \"Take Shelter,\" while in \"Marcy\" the movie ends like the projectionist forgot to put on the last reel.",

It doesn't knock you over the head with it's bluntness. It becomes more and more stressful as you see more of both stories. John Hawkes and Sarah Paulson are uniformly terrific as the dominant supporting characters on opposite sides of the film's divide.

The film features a breakout performance from Elizabeth Olsen who is magnetic in the title role. She delivers the breakout performance of the year and I hope that it takes her as far as last years Jennifer Lawrence and she is awarded with an Oscar nomination. There has been a lot of talk revolving around the ambiguity of the movie. There are no answers for some of what we see on screen but I gather that that is the point.

Purposefully made this way to be discussed afterwards I'm sure but I didn't really know what to make of it. For some movies that certainly works but I just needed some more of the story, it was left unfinished in too many areas.",

      "text": "Martha is picked up at the bus stop  scared, confused, and alone. As she attempts to settle in to a normal life with her sister, she is haunted by horrible images from the past, where she had become part of a hippie commune led by the persuasive and charismatic Patrick. Martha's nightmares, fear, and paranoia continue to build until she is unable to separate her dreams from reality. First-time director Sean Durkin has struck immediate success with MARTHA MARCY MAY MARLENE, the award-winning cult drama from 2011. Durkin delicately interlaces the past and the present as he retells Martha's chilling experiences using an organic story structure. It is terrifying to think just how easily an impressionable mind could be manipulated and controlled in such a way, but Durkin takes all of the right steps in disarming the audience in the same way that Patrick has disarmed his followers, perfectly illustrating the power of coercion and the psychological lures that draw people in to such a group. Elizabeth Olsen is phenomenal as Martha, and commits herself mind, body, and soul. There are moments where Martha makes contact with the viewer and causes them to turn away in shame for intruding into her thoughts and emotions. John Hawkes is deadly as Patrick, coming on with a subtle charm that effectively seduces the other characters under his spell before corrupting their minds. MARTHA MARCY MAY MARLENE will not be easily forgotten, and is a top-contender for Best in 2011.",

Yes, there's the fact it feels incomplete and without a proper ending to do the movie justice, making it feel more like a book instead of a film.

Unfortunately, plotwise, the film devolves into a vehicle for cheap thrills and goes nowhere. One wishes it would have been more, but for what it is, it is still worth a view.
