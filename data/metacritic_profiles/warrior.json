So i just saw it and wow! Was i blown away. I loved this movie, it started off a little slow but dont get me wrong, every scene played a big part in the overrall feel of the movie. Their was so much drama and heart packed into this film. You must go see this. You will love it. I wanted to cry, and i wanted to cheer, their were so many different emotions in thks one movie. Dont shy away from the long running time, it is so worth it, its one of those movies where you hate it because of the way you feel for the characters but then you love it at the same time. This is the best movie of september hands down, doesnt matter what else is coming out, Warrior is here now and it is damn good. On another note im really glad to see Tom Hardy fit for his role as Bane in Christopher Nolans final entry into his highly successful Batman trilogy. Anyways, Tom Hardy was excellemt, Joel Edgerton was excellent, and not familiar with the actor of the fathers name is but he did an academy award nodded performance. I will be upset if this movie doesn't get any Oscar nominations, it deserves ateast one. Go see this movie, you'll love it....and hate it, haha. Definitely 10/10 stars for sure.",

Sure it's predictable in the end, but sometimes, in this case, it's not about the destination(the ending), it's the journey to get to the destination. Even though this movie was 2 hours and 20 minutes it felt like 20 minutes, pretty fast journey I know, and that's a shame because I never wanted this movie to end. The characters are so great and well-developed that I felt for them throughout the movie, I cared about them, I felt their pain, and the amazing performances from the cast helped contribute to that. Especially Tom Hardy, Joel Edgerton, and Nick Nolte who give outstanding performances. I will be so shocked if not one of them are nominated. Everything else about this movie is just fantastic and hell I even cried twice during the last act of the movie. The action was gripping, the script was great, it was nicely shot especially during the fighting scenes, which I must warn you the camera does get a bit shaky but it's for a reason at least, and the score was just great it really added that extra dept to the scenes.

And that barely scratched the surface of their story, the depth of the characters is amazingly rich. The first half of the movie builds the foundation for the brothers, their present lives, their rough childhood and their own motivations to get back in the cage, it's as exciting and entertaining as the fighting scenes itself. There's about 4-5 climaxes in Warrior it's outstanding. Unlike a lot of sports/boxing movies we've seen you feel the high-octane scenes. You're really immersed in the fighting sequences, you feel every punch, every kick, every takedown and every headlock because you care about the characters, you know the journey of how they got where they are and you know all too well their hopes and promises to the people they care for.",

      "text": "I felt this film gave a particularly special spotlight on the familial drama that drives the passions of the characters here. Everything just seems so deeply personal and you want to root for everyone. Nick Nolte gives possibly the best performance of his career and Tom Hardy is incredibly true with his portrayal of a punk MMA fighter/AWOL Iraq veteran. Edgerton plays the underdog we all love to love and he does a fine job as well. What a great addition to the underdog canon!",

I just saw the ad for it and decided, \"meh, might as well.\" Best decision I have made recently as far as movies go. The emotional moments are gripping and you feel for the characters, even if their situations are as predictable as they can get (e.g. man fighting to get his family out of financial straits). The story is actually incredibly predictable, and I knew who was going to triumph at the end of it all. The action is fast-paced, and often brutal but enjoyably so. I actually felt my muscles tense up at specific points during the film, even after I had a firm grasp of how everything was going to turn out. I still had to tell myself to relax, because of the intensity of the fights as well as the intensity seem in emotions of the main characters. This movie makes me excited to see more of Hardy in the near future (Dark Knight Rises, anyone?). I have been recommending this film to anyone who is willing to listen to me. This really does give something for either gender as well, because it's not just about a bunch of men beating the sh*t out of each other.",

The story does resort to using cheap tactics to make the audience feel for the characters, the poor family who cant make ends meet and the husband having to resort to fighting is something we have seen many times in movies like this but the film does make it all work and is entertaining and satisfying.

My first glance, I thought it's gonna be like The Fighter since this film is about fighting sports and there's a brother relationship. But here, the brothers are against to each other. The film doesn't really spend so much time dealing with their relationship. It mostly goes to the father of the main leads. Tom Hardy (Tommy Conlon) delivers a moving and emotional performance of a man who has suffered greatly from the ones he loves, and from the field of battle, an all to real reality for people of today. While the younger Tommy suffered the loss of his mother firsthand, his older brother Brendan (Joel Edgerton)has put together a life that a man dreams of, yet is still haunted daily by his past. Only to have it threatened to be destroyed by the bank. Nick Nolte the alcoholic father of the two, has suffered years of remorse and regret from the abuse of alcohol and the neglect of his wife and children is trying to forge a bond but is meeting a stone wall with both of his sons. The fighting, though it is very well acted and shot, is not about fighting. It is the physical representation of the struggle between the three men, the struggle to forget and forgive and to move on. The demons that possess all three of these men are of such great proportion, the only way they can be relinquished is for them to come together. Definitely a must see movie this year!",

Joel Edgerton plays as \"Brendan\" who is Tommy's brother in the movie, who is a school teacher trying to provide money and food for his family, then he decides he wants to fight in a parking lot because he can earn a lot of money. Nick Nolte another brilliant actor, played as the father of the two sons. Who is trying to get the family back together but is on drugs and struggles. The fighting in this movie is Excellent, especially with the addition of former Olympic Gold Medalist, Kurt Angle played his role as a dangerous Russian fighting who doesn't get the chance to talk in the movie, but lets his fighting do the talking for him. Overall, this movie is AMAZING. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys Sports/ MMA/Fighting movies obviously, and anyone who enjoys very dramatic & Inspiring stories.

Edgerton did hold his own, not weakening the top tier cast (I'm not yet a fan, so am slightly reserved in my praise).

Joel Edgerton understated as the older son gives a quiet believable performance.  Fight sequences are exciting and cheer out loud worthy. I have seen this 3 times already and will watch it again.  Can't believe anybody gave this one anything less than a great review.",
