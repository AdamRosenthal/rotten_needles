The entire audience at the screening of The Queen of Versailles experienced this feeling about the Siegel family; they are truly atrocious people.

They had planes, Rolls Royces, multiple nannies for their seven kids, hosted parties for the Miss America pageant while David flirted with the contestants, and sat on a golden throne in their Orlando house during interviews for this documentary.  They also began construction on a mansion called Versailles, a project which would become the largest house in the entire United States.  It appears the filmmakers wanted to document the rise of this monstrosity of a house and display the lifestyle of the obscenely rich.  Even better, these rich people liked to flaunt in front of the camera, not enjoy their splendor in private ala Bill Gates.  David Siegel proudly claims he is individually responsible for George W. Bush winning the state of Florida and therefore the presidency; however, he chuckles that what he did was not exactly legal.  Oh yes, schadenfreude.  David called himself the 'King of Time Shares'.  He built 28 resorts and an enormous building on the Vegas strip, parceled them up, and sold them 52 different times to vacationers.  Then, in what must have exceeded all of the filmmakers' expectations, the recession hit and everybody in the country stopped buying time shares.",

      "text": "I thought, ultimately, this was a nasty, tedious piece of work.  The early part of the movie is \"fun,\" in a guilty-pleasure, voyeuristic sort of way.  But then the repetitive depictions of these people's miseries and yuchiness just feels petty and spiteful.  Especially over-the-line was getting and showing on screen the couple's teenage daughter saying that she didn't think her father loved her mother.   Viewer's could easily draw the conclusion themselves-- exploiting a rebilious teenager to say it on camera reflects a level of spite that's just really unappealing.",

They are different from you and me. They possess and enjoy early, and it does something to them, makes them soft, where we are hard, cynical where we are trustful, in a way that, unless you were born rich, it is very difficult to understand.\"",

Director Lauren Greenfield began her feature-length documentary with the goal of chronicling the audacious construction of a new residence, the largest in the United States, based on and named after Louis the 14th\u2019s old digs, Versailles.  What began as being potentially focused on this dream of the \u201cKing of Timeshares,\u201d David Siegel,  it was his queen that won over the director and subsequently the viewer.",
