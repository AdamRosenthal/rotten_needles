Instead, here we get earnestness, moralising and a quite underwhelming story with a surprisingly generous handful of cruel twists. Allison Janney is wonderful in quite a meaty role, and Rebel Wilson and Angela Kinsey add much needed spark and humour. I find it odd however that Chris Colfer would write himself a mostly unlikable role; pompous, arrogant, and dismissive of what he could learn from others. Is he supposed to be the hero? By the end, all I could muster was, \"really?\".",
