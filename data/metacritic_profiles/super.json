I went in expecting a quirky and fun nerd movie in the vein of Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, which is exactly the opposite of what I got until it wasn't, at which point it was exactly what I got, until it wasn't that either. Perhaps that requires some clarification. Keeping it spoiler free, this movie starts off as a mixture of bleakly depressing and ball-twistingly awkward, but at the same time somewhat endearing for all that, before a somewhat drastic change of pace with an intentionally amateurish title animation set to Green Day-style 90s grunge. After the intro it wallows in pity for a little bit longer before buckling down and being legitimately funny and clever while still keeping up the incredibly awkward subtext. This culminates when our hero decides that his weapon of choice shall be a pipe wrench, graphically beating people in a short montage which seems for all the world as if it's being played for laughs, and which ends with him dropping a cinderblock on a criminal's head from a fire escape. However, shortly afterward there's a complete tonal inversion as it goes from quirky and lovable to serious and almost frightening within the space of a few minutes, and suddenly it seems as if that little comedic montage was not as funny as it first appeared. From that point forward the movie flits back and forth between gritty horrific delivery of its message, somewhat humorous stylization, and some honestly disturbingly psychotic moments that I honestly don't know if I was frightened or amused by. The movie really gets serious right near the end, when it simultaneously has a moderately impressive action scene, delivers a cuttingly real portrayal of what would actually happen if random people decided to be vigilantes, takes a hard look at morality and fanaticism while cashing in on the allegories to organized religion that have played a small part throughout the movie, and still manages to be somewhat funny at times throughout all of this. The ending feels simultaneously satisfying and like an absolute tease. All in all this movie has a lot more to it than I bargained for, and while I'm sure more than one of you will interpret everything I've said as the movie just seeming schizophrenic, I honestly think it melds together quite expertly in a way which is near impossible to explain. It's certainly worth a watch, because while I can't say with any certainty that you'll like it, I can say that you'll never see anything else like this movie and it deserves a view simply because of how astoundingly unique and intriguing it is.",

James Gunn returns with another explosive cult-comedy starring Rainn Wilson as The Crimson Bolt, a self-made super hero that takes up crime-fighting after a seedy drug dealer makes off with his wife. Together with the help of his trusty side-kick, Boltie, they will squash evil in all of its many forms! In a James Gunn film, that includes beating people senseless over minor indiscretions like butting in line and keying cars, naturally. Gunn pulls no punches when it comes to crass, irreverent humor and exploitative violence, taking each to their veritable extremes while hiding behind the guise of a super hero film. Dig deep enough, and there are many powerful themes at work that speak directly towards the concept of the vigilante super hero and the essence of right and wrong. Rainn Wilson embodies the role of our deranged hero perfectly, providing an equal balance of sad ineptitude with never-ending hope and courage. Ellen Page's foul-mouthed Boltie adds an entertaining mix as well, when she is not taking the role too far over the top. As a wry wink to the super hero genre, SUPER cannot be beat!",

He uses his same Dwight Schrute attitude to fight so-called crime with no superpowers, but a pipe wrench. Kevin Bacon was pretty good as the drug dealer who steals his wife from him. Ellen Page is probably what made this film funny, and not so much Rainn WIlson's stupidity as a superhero. Ellen was great as comic fan who loves violence and justice. Without a doubt one of her fiestiest roles ever. There were some good funny scenes with Rainn WIlson, it usual happens when he's first starting out as a hero. This film is really violent though. There is so much head-bashing and explosions. It was kinda funny seeing the action words pop up, but it seemed they kinda forgot to bring them back during the action sequences later in the movie. In the end, this was just okay. It was pretty funny and somewhat exciting until the last 20 minutes, where its gets extreme and really violent.

There's even a scene where Ellen Page nearly smashes someone with a statue in nearly the same way Alex killed the cat lady in a clockwork orange.  Now I'll get into the problems.  First off, the movie both makes fun of and embraces Christianity at the same time, which is probably the weirdest and most hypocritical perspective I've ever seen a movie take.  You shouldn't make fun of God at all, and you definitely can't have it both ways.  A major character dies that just shouldn't have ,which is annoying but I won't tell you who, and the ending is depressing.  Not trying to give spoilers but it was and not even in a comedic way.

Every character has some form of mania that drives them, whether it's Wilson's religious epiphanes, Tyler's dependence on drugs or Page's full-blown insanity. The performance highlights of the film are Nathan Fillion's bizarre turn as a TV evangelical superhero, and Ellen Page who is just plain terrifying (and who is the dark heart of the film). It's often funny but other jokes are misjudged,  the pacing of the film is a bit off and it's just too depraved.
