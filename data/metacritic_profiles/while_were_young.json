      "text": "Jon Turteltaub's \"While you were sleeping\" has all the trappings and familiar ingredients that make up a standard romantic dramedy it has the all too familiar set up. The girl is in love with the person but he does not notice her or she does not make herself know, something happens and she either is thrust into his life or ends up lying to be close to him. In this case, Lucy Moderatz (Sandra Bullock) lies to the object of her affection (Peter Gallagher) family in order to get close to him and be near when he wakes up. You see Lucy saved  Peter Callaghan(the first object of her affection)  after he fell on the tracks and is subsequently knocked into a coma  they take him to the hospital with her in tow and the case of mistaken identity ensues his family thinking he is Peter's fianc\u00c3\u00a9e. If you think this sounds conventional and familiar well then you are wrong the only thing conventional about this picture is the set up to this touching and very deep romance story. At the very center of this film  \"While you were Sleeping\" is the rare romantic dramedy that  takes you by surprises  not by the fact that you can see what's  coming a mile away but by the fact that you did not see it coming makes all the difference.  Jon Turtltaub's \"While you Were Sleeping\" is a film at first I did not expect to like at all it seemed like nothing more than a standard, run of the mill romantic dramedy that would do  nothing more than just provide the usual story of a lonely love struck girl getting the man of  her dreams. However, after seeing this picture my opinion of this film completely changed I started seeing it for what it is an extremely charming, touching, heartfelt and funny film that is far beyond the standards of Romantic comedy flair. \"While you Were Sleeping\" is intelligent and daring it is not afraid to show its human side to show how vulnerable its characters as regular people can be. How they easily are hurt, you see in a typical romantic comedy the characters insult each other like there is no tomorrow they hurt one another repeatedly until they finally concludes that this is not how love works in fact it is the exact opposite its called hatred. The characters in this film  do not overtly insult each other  sure there are moments where they tease one another but for the most part they   are  a caring bunch  of people the most caring would have to be 0x Callaghan(Peter Boyle) who is one of the few Callaghan's that embraces Lucy from the get go. Boyle's character is a sweet yet feisty fellow who is not afraid to defend the ones he loves when needed, that is the key to this films excellence that is what makes it so real, so human, so warm and loving it is the vibrant characters. Without theses colorful cast of characters this film would sink into the low standards the sub genre is recognized. \"While You were Sleeping\" is a film that can not be missed or ignored  it is just too good to be true and to funny and sweet to resist and even though I knew this film was going to have a happy ending, even though I saw where it was headed  I still found myself enjoying and loving every single minute of this beautifully drawn film.   This film is built from familiar ingredients   but this film has such charm and such spirit that no matter how much this film comes off as another rom-com dished out. You will love every single frame and every single minute of this film, the only other thing that saves this film is the magnificent performance from the ever-lovely Sandra Bullock. It is her performance that elevates this film that and the skill of director Jon Turteltaub and his team together they create a film that works better than it should and plays out far better than you could ever expect. The filmmakers do what seldom few directors do in theses films they put a human soul into it, they put real emotions and real feelings into this film that not only affects the mood of the movie but also affects the mood of the audience. If the characters are, arguing and fighting all the time than the audience can become agitated by this and turn there backs on the film. That however, is not the case with this film   you feel for the characters you sympathize with the characters you  even grow with them   as they find there sense o belonging in this world , or in the case  of Lucy Moderatz, her sense of belonging. That is what makes a good romantic dramedy and that is why others fail they do not capture the heart and soul the trials ad tribulations that come with the feelings of love. \"While you Were Sleeping\" hits all the right notes.",
