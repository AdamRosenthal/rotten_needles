      "text": "kind of the opposite of the other movie I watched today, I liked this one a lot less than I expected. Its gotten mixed reviews mostly on the good side Id say. Unfortunately it does not deserve the praise. What I did respect about the movie was the way the creature looked. It looked like they mostly used practical effects mixed with a little bit of cgi. This in my opinion was a great move on part of the directors. Using practical effects is almost a must for me. There has been a flood of cgi filled creature features and most of the time as soon as the crappy digitally animated creature shows up it pulls me right out of the movie. The creature in this movie looked great, Unfortunately the movie has nothing else going for it, The whole movie takes place around a group of teenagers stranded on a small boat. They make incredibly bad and unbelievable decisions that just piss you off and just over half way through I couldn't wait for this movie to end. It would have been nice to see them do something special with this cool creature and when it finds its first victim I thought things were looking up but they definitely went down from there.",

      "text": "Beneath is a very effective horror movie that's more than just a simple scary ride.  Beneath works on multiple levels...  Although set on a lake with a monster in the water, at its core, the movie is really about life in high school (or at the office).  The biggest threat our characters face is each other, rather than the monster.  The use of a practical monster, rather than a cgi creation, adds to the gritty realism.  The young, attractive cast plays the movie with necessary intenseness, and the cinematography is beautiful  Ultimately, Beneath is a scary, funny and smart movie.  My friends and I all enjoyed it.  Definitely worth checking out!",

Some scary moments, but actually quite satisfying as the monster and the friends' strained relationships take their toll.  The monster could look more real, though.  Good music.  Nice to see the wheel chair dude in Breaking Bad actually speak.  He's pretty damn creepy.",
