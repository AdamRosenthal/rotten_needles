I loved the teasing because that's when you know they got you hooked. Many monster movie franchises in the past pulled this off effectively and no one complained about it. Let\u2019s start off with Alien and the way that teases us little by little on what it looks like as it kills people one by one. The next one is Predator. This one is completely camouflaged killing squad members until Arnold is the only one left to finally show himself. Just look at movies like Jaws, Dragonslayer, Terminator, The hidden, Jurassic Park, The abyss and many others. This is a great formula because it keeps you in anticipation. Pacific Rim was pure garbage from beginning to end. I'm glad this movie didn't follow that path because then there\u2019s nothing for you to look forward to. Children probably liked Pacific Rim just like another movie called Transformers. These are movies that failed to have an on par story. All they are is multimillion dollar toy commercials from beginning to end in which by the time the movie is over you wind up with a migraine. There\u2019s no suspense or WOW moment unlike what the new Godzilla movie accomplished. There are enough Godzilla WOW moments and Trailer scenes that were newly edited which no one talks about. This made every Godzilla scene new to me. Also I will say that I have seen every Godzilla movie and I will say that this one had more screen time than each of those other ones. Now with talks of a sequel they will probably add more fight scenes but they have to stick to this formula.",

The monsters seem to be able to become silent and invisible at will, Godzilla's place in the film is barely explained (and poorly at that), the Japanese scientist pulls theories from thin air based on NO data whatsoever but which somehow turn out to be correct. Its a painful watch, and just seeing the Big G stomping around for a little while in classic form isn't nearly enough to save this clunker.

He submerges for the first time in 60 years just to kick the bad guys butts and then immediately leaves as soon as the job was over as if he was just waiting to be a good guy.  Some criticize this film for lacking action but I actually found that to be a great relief in the days where every blockbuster movie must spend 45 minutes of the film blowing things up for no reason.  To discuss the positive aspects of the film, the CGI monsters really do look fantastic and some scenes of the fight sequences were genuinely very cool but what drags this movie down is how Godzilla is almost a supporting character whose only role is to save the day when needed.

Godzilla required him to deliver a few scenes that were more serious and emotional and he simply couldn't do it. Making his lack of acting chops even more apparent was the incredible acting of Bryan Cranston and Elizabeth Olsen. The other fail in the film was that they tried to artificially manufacture drama in order to add intrigue. All those things did was take away from the film. Honestly, I feel that this movie would've been so much better if it was about 30 minutes shorter. Johnson's lack of acting ability wouldn't have been so pronounced and the ridiculousness of the unrealistic drama wouldn't have existed.

(2) The Mutos look ridiculous. Nasty, very large praying mantises.  (3) Pretty awful acting.  I checked out the hero's bio and was shocked to find that he is not a graduate of a pre-school acting academy.  His disturbed, vacant stares into the distance gave me that impression.  (4) Turn some damn lights on!  What are you hiding?  Mediocre and unimaginative CGI? (5) Someone in Hollywood, please find the excellent David Strathairn (the Admiral) a job in the good movie he deserves.  I was frankly embarrassed for him.",

      "text": "Awesome trailer, lacklustre film. This is a film which is supposed to be about monsters fighting monsters, but seems intent on focusing as little attention as possible on the incredible struggle between two monoliths, to concentrate on a decent, but far from original story of a 'man torn away from family, and suffering to fight for his family' tale. The craziest part of this whole film isn't what's in it, but rather, what ISN'T in it, primarily Godzilla himself. Like seriously, they mention godzilla a few times at the start of the film, but the next 40 mins isn't even about Godzilla, it's about some other plot instead. Godzilla then briefly appears, and boy when he appears for his 4 minutes, he sure is an awesome sight to behold...until we switch back to some annoying plot about how the military keep on angsting like a teenage girl before prom about how they can't kill the beast, and how ineffective they are, and so on and so forth. For me personally, this feels like a few parts of an A+ film sprinkled over what is essentially a B movie. Bryan Cranston is awesome(as always), making his personal tragedy felt even across the screen, and portraying his role as haunted paranoid in a brilliant fashion...which makes everything else look ridiculous when you see how unenthused the other actors seem to be in their roles. Even the Godzilla special effects are amazing, when they actually show them...but that makes the 90% of the film where Godzilla is absent(and he is absent, not like a 'i'm doing something awesome' absent, but more like a 'I show up, wreck **** for 5 mins, then return back to the sea for some relaxing swimming for the next 50 mins' absent) feel so incredibly dry and sterile. For the action sequences, I hope you enjoy watching 100 foot lizards wrestling with 80 foot monsters...ON A CRAPPY TV FOR 30 SECONDS(seriously, look at the movie where Godzilla first appears and the kid is watching TV, and that is how long it's shown for).",

The plot is silly and incomplete with most of the times some unknown character look at the sky with awe. The flying monsters are so synthetic looking, you get tired of looking at them for the second time.

This is by no means a bad movie, but for how long the movie was compared to how little we saw Godzilla, I was left wanting more and feeling somewhat robbed. That being said, the scenes Godzilla WAS in (chiefly those near the end) were some of the best I've seen on the big screen in quite some time. The reason my score is a 5, however, has more to do with the awful cliched bits forced in throughout the movie. I realize this movie was a big nod to the Godzilla movies of old (which was, admittedly, well done) but that doesn't mean we can't have character development and deeper plots than: hero soldier torn from wife and child and does heroic deeds only to be reunited with them against all odds. Sadly are left with 10 minutes of awesome Godzilla footage and an hour and 50 minutes of shallow, plotless nonsense. To cap it all off, the money maker, Brian Cranston, is on screen for about the same amount of time as Godzilla... why even cast him at all if not to lure Breaking Bad fans into theaters if you're not even going to give him ample time to help drive the plot?",

Well unlike Ronald Emmerich helmed 1998 remake, which I haven't seen so far, this is the best monster movie made in Hollywood since Jurassic Park. In some parts it is even better and more creative than Jurassic Park. Only thing lacking is the humour and memorable character like Dr. Ian Malcolm or Dr. Alan Grant from Jurassic Park. But enough with the comparison, let 's talk about the film on its own. This movie is non-stop entertaining that's for sure. It is entertaining even when the scene does not involve monster fights and human drama. And main credit for this goes to Bryan Cranston(whom we said goodbye on TV last year as \"Walter White\" on incredible finale of equally incredible \"Breaking Bad\") and Ken Watanabe who steal every scene they are in as scientist due to their incredible acting despite the fact they are in supporting role. As for the leading characters played by Aaron Taylor Johnson and Elisabeth Olsen as husband and wife, they are okay in their performance, but are not convincing enough to be a parent of 5 year old, since they themselves look like a teenager.

All of the fighting took place on the TVs IN the movie, that's ridiculous! I wish I was watching those televisions besides this mediocre garbage. Anyways, (3) Ending barely made sense. This so called \"massive bomb\" had successfully evacuated the area, by the terrible-acted-protagonist, in less than 5 min on a mini boat. THAT'S A MIRACLE! There are many more awful parts to this movie but to spare my fingers of typing 5000 characters, I'll end here for this movie doesn't even deserve my rant. Hopefully this disgrace does not carry out a complete trilogy. Best case scenario, Japan make their own Godzilla film and show America once again what a true Godzilla film looks like.

Sure by showing the monsters from an 'ordinary man' perspective and delaying the monsters' reveal, Edwards made a creative choice that is artistic but controversial at the same time.  It would have worked wonderfully if the characters are strong like in Spielberg's earlier efforts (Jaws, Close Encounters..) But Aaron Taylor's character is not compelling that it almost derails the whole film. (a weakness of old Japanese Godzilla films too in fact)  Thank goodness for the kick ass monster action and spectacle, while reserved for the final third, was so great that you don't  mind those boring bits.

In this first Kaiju film, this is in black and white, they speak Japanese and it's over a ninety-eight minutes if the film which that sucks to only me. Now next am going do about Godzilla 2014. In this new reboot franchise, this has new creatures fighting Godzilla in it, perfect sound, and visual effects, also in 3D and IMAX 3D and best action performances which I gotta say I loved it better then the 1954 one and other franchises before the new one came out.

Cranston\u2019s character did not get as much screen time as I would have liked to see and the protagonists roll was passed down to a much harder character to follow. At that point, about forty-five minutes in, the movie became a mess. I spent the remainder of the film trying to ignore simple mistakes that stacked up. There was so much potential in this film to capture the emotions of the people on the ground, witnessing thousands of deaths. Instead of doing so the makers focused on the monster movie element which just became another summer movie blockbuster. Passing realistic time was the biggest con in my opinion, everything happened way too fast and that didn\u2019t help the pacing at all. The last half hour of the movie was pretty shallow with a cookie cutter climax that was not only unrealistic but a compromise to the show's overall potential and integrity. Despite the many problems with what could have been a more meaningful storyline, it looked great on the big screen and kept me entertained for the first forty minutes. In the end Godzilla was loud, flashy, and made out as a hero, even though he likely stomped hundreds of people to death as he made his way through San Francisco.",

I bring that up because they both had the same problem. They had very key components that make great movies that they just fumbled with and squandered away. The only characters that seemed to drive the plot anywhere ended up dying or just timidly disappearing from the moment. And Godzilla is this like god of earth who balances all nature who saves man from catastrophe, and he just wants to help us. I mean because that was clear right? He just pretty much destroys any city he walks into and doesn't seem to be all that great of a fighter either. I wanted fight scenes of Pacific Rim proportions, couldn't even give that to us. Godzilla is a Japanese baby, and they tried to make it American, if you follow me, and they failed. It was hard to sit through this one without laughing at what they managed to get away with in this movies. They possessed good footholds in the beginning of the movie and created a unique way to look at the Godzilla creatures and their mythology. But certain scenes and certain plot points nosedived everything. Too many holes. This makes he 1990s one look golden. For shame.",

The creators spent a lot of the movie explaining the existence of Godzilla and his origin. Of course it is logical to tackle that subject and explain why and how Godzilla came to be on earth and what awoke him to begin with. The movie leaves the viewer constantly deciding to love or hate Godzilla in respect - or fear - of his awesome power and dangerous presence. In the end, Godzilla unfortunately is a bit camera shy and doesn't make much of an appearance. Overall, the quality of the movie is great and goes much beyond action and explosions. The good thing about the story-telling style of this film is that if there is ever a sequel (for some reason) then Godzilla will not need any more explanation as to why he is on earth. There are characters throughout the movie as well but they all fail to captivate the viewer, but instead are simply tools used to drive the plot further. There is not much of an emotional attachment to the main character, instead I felt more attachment to Godzilla himself - not to mention I am sure that we were all cheering him on at some point - knowing full well that the main character consistently remained virtually powerless against the odds.",

A lot of the acting  in the 1998 version was downright silly, especially the \u201clove story,\u201d but one thing that movie did was exploit New York as a setting and that was fun to watch \u2013 Madison Square Garden, the Brooklyn Bridge, etc. In this current version, Honolulu and Las Vegas could have been almost anywhere (we saw a lot of American tourists and some slot machines) and San Francisco was totally wasted (don\u2019t they have hills there?). Also much was made of having quality actors like Juliette Binoche, Bryan Cranston, and Elizabeth Olsen, but you don\u2019t see them very much (don\u2019t blink or you will miss Binoche entirely) and a lot of what the others do is silly or insipid. On the other hand, we see much too much of Aaron Taylor-Johnson who looks dazed and confused most of the time (a hero he ain\u2019t  -- not that he runs away, but mostly he is either complaining or being ineffectual). I thought the monsters were good, and so were their battle scenes \u2013 and yes, the idea was good, but really do you want to go to a serious Godzilla film? The audience applauded when Godzilla finally breathed fire, but the applause at the end was tepid. In many ways, I found this film unimaginative and mediocre.",

All the movies build suspense and show us glimpses of the monster throughout the film. Then, before we get too bored, they reveal the creatures. With these movies, the main monsters drive the films plot and story. Godzilla, however, doesn't really do that. The whole plot is driven by the film's antagonists: the MUTO's (Massive Unidentified Terrestrial Organisms). The MUTO's cause most of the film's destruction and terror. And, in my opinion, the MUTO's are too generic and forgettable. I don't have a short attention span, Godzilla just isn't in the movie. The MUTO's look too much like the Cloverfield monsters. If Godzilla is supposed to be an allegory for nuclear destruction, or the destructive force of nature, well it doesn't really work out in my opinion. If the focus of the originals was to show how Godzilla affected peoples lives, they didn't really show that in this reboot. Most of the movie was about a generic mission to stop Godzilla and the MUTO's.",

The script was inept with more plot holes than Carter has little liver pills.  The directing was abominable.  I wouldn't watch this horrible movie again even when on FREE TV.  How bad was this Godzilla?  Enough so that it made the terrible NOAH worthy of a 10.  Avoid at all costs.",

It was no Pacific Rim, thank God, because i was so expectant for that movie and it was a major disappointment to me. This movie however, was more like a disaster movie, rather than a monster movie. I was a little disappointed that Godzilla was not in very many scenes, but afterward, I thought about it and talked with friends and I realized I was kind of glad because then it would have simply been another Pacific Rim. Only it would have been Kaiju fighting Kaiju. Godzilla looked awesome! On that, we all agreed. The acting suffered a bit but the storyline was interesting. overall, I enjoyed the look and feel of the movie. It's what a summer movie should be, loud, exciting, and intense!",

I first have to compliment the engaging human element that was lacking and reduced to downright embarrassment in the horrid first American reboot in 1998. While despite Aaron Taylor-Johnson's character dragging at times, he still manages to be a tolerable lead along with his talented supporting cast, especially since the original Godzilla films never had acting as a strong suit. The screenplay was gratifyingly reminiscent of previous Godzilla installments as well; while not being the most ideally written it's still effective enough to grip the attention span with its serious feel. The score for the film composed by Alexandre Desplat, has an old school Akira Ifukube vibe to it, paying reverence to the great Godzilla anthems of old, while injecting an additional neoteric feel that helps set the dark tone for the film. This gives each scene an extra ounce of thrilling tension. Now, as for Godzilla himself, he is seen for a limited time in his own film which was not necessarily a bad thing. Gareth Edwards' incessant build-up and teases work like a charm to make the audience crave more of the big guy (who is designed into his most intimidating incarnation to date), and more of his terrifyingly alluring parasitic foes. With that being said, the film culminates with one of the most awe-inspiring and jaw-dropping giant monster smack downs to ever be graced on screen. The nearly impeccable CGI in this film make the fight scenes seem even more unparalleled to anything that any Godzilla movie or action movie has ever delivered before.",

Other monsters besides Godzilla? Check. I could go on and on about all the stuff you see in the trailers, but I have a review to make and a statement to say. My statement? Godzilla (GZ) is, without a doubt, a spectacular film overall, and one of the most special films to come to this genre in years. GZ is ambitious, creative, destructive, and AWESOME. What's special about GZ compared to other action and GZ films is that it mixes so much into it. GZ actually has a fair amount of human drama. With this, GZ makes you care about the characters and you might actually hope to God that they don't die when destruction hits. Before the big guy is revealed, the movie makes you feel fear. Gareth Edwards proves he is brilliant because he knows audiences will want to see the big guy pretty soon once they get in there. To keep audiences satisfied, he puts another monster in there brilliantly before the big guy comes. How was the acting? Extremely good. Aaron Taylor-Johnson should really be in other action movies after this. Bryan Cranston? You know what you're getting with that amazing actor. The others are almost as good. However, when Aaron Taylor-Johnson travels across the country with the army, I really felt that if he had another great character with him his journey would have fared better. But how is the action? It is extremely destructive. It has a much larger scale with the giant monsters, which you might dislike. Me? I loved every second of it, but I did feel that in the third and most violent act, the destruction could have used a little bit of more variety. Plus, it did get frustrating from time to time when they cut off the action and go back to the drama. Like I said, I loved the human drama. It just got a little tedious there. Despite these small flaws, GZ is phenomenal. This might actually be the first movie I have reviewed and recommend to everyone. And I do. Since the users can't use a 100 scale for scoring, I gotta give it a 10.",

Here goes: the movie ends with Godzilla being cheered by masses because he had just killed the other two monsters (hybrids between a bat, the alien, praying mantis, and early days of robotics) with his dragon breath. His motive was to restore balance?!?! Humans are quite inconsequential, and they all act like bunch of people who just don't care and are fully aware that all of it is just make believe. Anyhow, give it a wide berth.",

Instead of a typical temper tantrum plot, the protagonist hero isn't feeling sorry for himself, and things are quite meta(love, God, family) under the surface. The suspense and technical achievement combined make for an exciting picture that is highly involving, and especially delivers a great adversary, with nods to early Spielberg(Jaws and Close Encounters), some bashing of later Spielberg(totally overrated JP). The action sequences are complex, easy to follow and beautifully captured. Godzilla delivers on a huge build up, and the monster fights are great. Thank you Thomas Tull for hiring Gareth Edwards.",

You get the feeling that director Gareth Edwards forgot that if you're doing a franchise reboot, you have a checklist to fill out, and he only remembered this late into the film. Also this film dabbles in the same mistake that the Transformers films in that there way to much focus, on the unimportant humans, but luckily to much less of a degree due to both doing it less, and recognizing that giant monsters are not the best at giving intellegible dialogue. Watanabe plays the only person who knows what the hell is going on, but we get stuck with Johnson's character who is exhibiting far less intelligence about the situation than he should be. It's not a bad movie, it's just a movie that clearly shows you that it can be better. For a sequel, either Evans needs to learn how a giant monster movie should work, or Legendary should hand it over to either Guillermo Del Toro, Neill Blomkamp, or the Wachowskis.",

I don't know why i got myself hyped up so much because i just feel even further, so here is my review of Godzilla. Let's start with the acting with Johnson as our lead he really doesn't say much..at all, and when he does speak it is literally five words- now this didn't bother me too much just it did get annoying. Wantanabe provided a decent performance and he didn't say much either, heck pretty much nobody said much in this film, i think the only person who said anything more than five words was Cranston who was axed before the 30 minute mark. Now we move onto the CGI, and boy it was impressive, no flaws and actually quite convincing, except for maybe the flood scene, even so i am glad to see that the money went to the department that is needed the most in a film like this. Now onto the writing, what can you expect from a monster film, poor writing and not the greatest explanation for a story, the film itself was so predictable and so stereotypical it wasn't even funny, i just feel the movie could have been better if the writers (who also wrote Doom and The Expendables) could have put some more effort into their work. Now i come to the final and most important component, the action and it really did work, it was perfect, Godzilla's reveal- perfect, the fight scene in Hawaii- awesome and final battle in San Fransisco, well it was a little bit overdone but still i can bypass that and say with confidence that this remake was better than the 1998 version. I highly recommend you watch Godzilla as it is awesome just not a great film therefore it receives a 6/10.",

Unfortunately, the scenes of destruction don't occur until about halfway through the film and Bryan Cranston doesn't appear for long. Also, much of the film is shot at night so it's very difficult to see the mayhem created, so don't bother with seeing this in 3D as the images will be rendered useless. The build-up to the tension is extremely long so you might be bored by the exposition where only Cranston out of all the humans characters, injects energy. One also wonders if this movie should be called \"Muto\" because these creatures seem to feature more in the film than Godzilla. It doesn't matter what the critics say anyway because \"Godzilla\" will still be a huge international box office hit.",

I always love going into a movie not knowing what is going to happen next or in the case of this movie, not knowing about anything besides Bryan Cranston's amazingness and Godzilla being in the movie with maybe another monster, or two. Three is better than 2. Godzilla's opponents, the M.U.T.O's are awesome in their own ways. They're a great challenge for old Goji, who is looking rather tubby in 2014, but probably twice as big as the last time we saw him, back in Final Wars in 2003/2004. He actually looks like Godzilla instead of the iguana thing from the 1998 movie. The rest of the characters didn't really bother me as much as they bothered others, I never really saw a problem, the humans in Godzilla movies are never really fleshed out like they would be in other movies. I'm just used to it by now. But people need to expand their minds because there's military men just like Ford in the movie, they're trained for extreme situations. Anyways, the movie looks amazing, some of the best CGI around was used in this movie, the fights look very realistic and not as flashy as they were in Pacific Rim. The movie also has an amazing soundtrack for the monster fights and tense scenes. Its also a very loud movie, but loud in a good way, it literally sounds like Godzilla is in the theater with you and is roaring, and the first roar he lets out at the airport scene shakes the theater and goes right through you. It really tests the strength of the eardrums. Phenomenal experience, and the best movie of 2014 so far.",

I get that - also terrible acting by the lead and the guy that you get to connect with dies after 15 minutes. However if you did not have orgasms about the movie before you saw it or if you have never hear of Godzilla before, it is a good monster movie - keeps the suspense till the last minute and pretty nice effects and brutal killing. This might be a franchise starter unlike the 90s hollywood version which sucked. Also liked the ancient apex predator thing, it is a small thing but a very smart way to make the experience more relatable and realistic. This movie is like the Man of Steel of the Superman franchise; it is there to divide audience into two groups almost equal in size, it certainly has cool destruction scenes and the tone of a thriller. I generally liked it but I doubt that I would watch it again if somehow it gets streamed on television sometime later.",

I will warn you that Godzilla will not be seen in this film that much, in fact there is a lot of teases in this film where you think you're about to see Godzilla in action, but then it would get cut off. I will say that the scenes that involve human drama though are actually good and there is even a pretty emotional scene near the beginning. I do hope that if this film ever gets a sequel, that it will have more fight scenes in it, but for now I do want to say that this was good even if you felt that the \"main star\" didn't feel like the main star. If you can deal with that one flaw and actually try to engage with the decent human drama, then this film will be enjoyable.",

Note how he \"whites out\" information about the filmmakers and actors against background imagery of everything from Darwin's Origin of Species to classified documents on nuclear testing. The other themes have been much discussed and usually mistakenly by conventional movie reviewers who really have no idea what they are watching.

I mean he has like two total expressions throughout the movie. He barely shows emotion from his father's death and gets over it extremely quick. Doesn't panic or seem to care when MUTO or Godzilla shows, that bothered me throughout the movie how poor of an actor he was. Visuals were great....but i don't understand the purpose for the NAVY skydiving out of that plane. All they did was land on the ground, they could've just flew down there with the plane.. The two monsters weren't worried about anyone else unless u attacked them. They were tryna fight each other. I guess that was evidently done for the purpose of a good stunt and visual nothing else. And yes MUTO probably overshadowed Godzilla a little bit. The MUTO did seem like it was the main monster for awhile. Overall, I can't really give this movie anything spectacular, it was good enough for me to enjoy however. Was not bad at all but nothing in this movie put it over the top.

PR had amazing action, visual effects, and a very noisy soundtrack. This was moody, dark, and the visuals weren't its strongest suit. The key here is how people react to natural disasters. Many critics have already mentioned that this Godzilla is not a metaphor of man-made nuclear war but nature-made disasters. The creatures in this film including Godzilla are all giant metaphors for how mother nature will do what she wishes and she will correct the earth accordingly. Not even military might will stop these forces of nature, just another force of nature can. Ken Watanabe explains this explicitly towards the end of the film for those still wondering the lack of a \"Godzilla vs the Monsters\" type of smack down. The ending of the film even refers to Godzilla as \"The King of the Monsters.\" Probably a taste of things to come. This film has proven to be a very generous appetizer. Here's to hoping Edwards has a slightly bigger budget to play next time. Pacific Rim was like pounding beers with friends on a hot summer day.

The effects on Godzilla are amazing, the atmosphere created is perfect, and the action sights are some of the best to grace the cinema this summer. With the film nailing the elements of a Godzilla movie it is baffling while this is shoved into the background. The film instead focuses on a bunch of human characters who the audience is supposed to care about but it is difficult to when they are poorly developed and when you see glimpses of amazing fight scenes in the background you are screaming for the film to focus on that. Had the film cut down on the lengthy build up and just give us a straightforward monster fighting movie this could\u2019ve been one of the highlights of the summer. Instead, the film makes the bizarre choice to not focus on those elements much resulting in a film that is sometimes awesome. This is a frustrating film as the atmosphere, build up, and payoff created are amazing but the film doesn\u2019t seem interesting that. Why would you make a Godzilla movie if you aren\u2019t going to focus on Godzilla? I am open to new interpretations of the story but it feels like a tease to provide such amazing action scenes but show not much interest them. Maybe I\u2019d be more excepting if this film wasn\u2019t called Godzilla. The film could\u2019ve used any other random monster and the film would\u2019ve meant even less. The action is amazing but unlike Pacific Rim I felt like it never got to fully payoff.

The filmmaking and acting elevates the movie into good territory and it has a handful of jaw dropping moments so I'd still recommend it.  But it's still not what the filmmakers or trailer promised.

Yes, holding Godzilla back until roughly an hour in was sort of a letdown as well as killing off Brian Cranston(the only actor who seemed to give a **** the entire film) but this film mostly suffered from what I felt like was under-developed characters and over-all a somewhat too \"human centered\" movie. Yes, showing the human side of Godzilla's path of destruction is a much needed quality to these movies but not to the extent of giving your title charcter around 24 minutes of TOTAL screen time(+small appearances in the beginning). Besides, most of the movie showed the humans being stupid and trying to nuke Godzilla(who feeds off nuclear fallout) and the MUTOs, the entire human aspect of the film could have been done alot better then the simple \"lets nuke em\" approach. I didn't have as much problems with the MUTOS either but I moreso had a problem with how they were pushed up to be some unstoppable force but were easily destroyed in an awesome fashion by Godzilla. The fight scene towards the end really made the movie for me as a whole and the final appearance by Godzilla was glorious as well. All in all, I feel like this movie was very well done.",

I can't help thinking he was only in this as a selling point because he was in Breaking Bad. Instead they make us sympathise with a dull and unrelatable marine soldier. This brings the film down further because he's terrible in this. Honestly the most blatant and obvious example of a bad main character. The most interesting character (next to Bryan Cranston) is Godzilla himself. At the end of the film, he's treated as some sort of hero for defeating the enemy MUTO's. But here's the thing in every film he's portrayed in Godzilla only serves himself and nothing else. I only thought that Godzilla defeated the MUTO's because he wanted to reclaim his territory which is cool but the film ultimately wants to express Godzilla as a saviour of the people instead of an uncaring and unfeeling atrocitie of humankind. Overall Godzilla is a good watch if not a little dull in parts. But if the perfectly executed fight scenes sell it to you then this film could be forgiven for a lot.",

I'd be fine if they didn't tease you with fights and didn't have cardboard characters. Another thing to add, was Godzilla was the good guy. Yes, we have gone from bad ass anti-hero just trying to survive to saving the day good guy. And the dark tone? Well forget that! Because by the end people are screaming praise to him by the end of it and everyone makes it out alright. Oh yeah, You remember Cranston? That amazing actor they put in everything for our marketing and advertising? HAH! You actually thought they'd put him in for the whole movie! No, lets only kill him off! And make his boring son (I actually like Aaron-Taylor Johnson but in this movie, he's as emotionless as a rock) the main character. I also found the Muto very uninspired and expect them to be the main monsters, because Godzilla is just used as an excuse for them not to breed.

Even though the movie had some down sides it still had positive sides like, awesome special effects and CGI, interesting action, and a brand new Godzilla who may appear to be fat, but hey, least they made his atomic breath look cool and brought back his iconic roar. So unless you didn't like the 1998 version this reboot will make you forget that one even existed. Let's just hope that the planned future sequel will be better.",

      "text": "It really bothers me to write this review.  I've been pumped since this movie was announced because I was a Godzilla fan since I was a little kid.  This movie just did not do it for me.  The movie bothered me because they advertised HEAVILY on Bryan Cranston.  Then Bryan dies in like the first 30 minutes of the movie and instead you get a very stale and boring Aaron Taylor Johnson.  The human story was one of the most boring human stories in a Godzilla movie.  Listen,  I'm aware that the original one had a lot of teasing and \"tension building\"  but in the first movie there was a mystery.  You know what I mean it was like \"Whats Godzilla?\" \"When is he going to attack?\"  In this one is was like oh Godzilla is about to fight a Muto *cuts to something else*  Me and my brothers started to FREAK OUT.  We all know the fight is going on but they don't feel like showing it instead watch Aaron Taylor Johnson and his squad running.  Another bad thing is that Godzilla is not really the focus.  Not even monster wise the Mutos were more of the focus monster wise.  But a thing that completely overshadowed the monster story was the horrible.. stale... boring human story.  It featured Bryan Cranston (which was great while it lasted)  Aaron Taylor Johnson (come on he could've tried harder) and Ken Watanabe (completely underused).  Aaron Taylor Johnson had a terrible performance and showed no emotion even after his father died.  Godzilla was one of the most badass looking Godzillas however and I did enjoy the new Muto monsters.  The CGI was one of the best CGI's I've ever seen.  However this was not the movie that was advertised.",

I was not disappointed, but yet I was a little bit. This movie did Godzilla right. The monster I mean, his character was just what he needed to be. This was very important to me and I was happy to see it, considering how wrongly done the 1998 version was. Overall, the movie isn't really anything special, the cast is a bit lackluster and the acting/script isn't much either. It drags on for a long time and Godzilla is seen few and far. Director Edwards went on and on about this \"cinematic foreplay\" he would be using and I was surprised how much of it was used. We were TEASED with Godzilla. Showing fights but then not really and stuff like this. I initially was very frustrated by this, but after a second and third watch see what he was going for. The combat in the end is stunning. Absolutely jaw dropping. Technology has truly come far to create the king of monsters and his foes so perfectly. Now I don't speak for everyone, but I would estimate that if you are a godzilla fan like myself, this movie is generally between 7/10 and 10/10 and if you are not, I would say 5/10 to 8/10. It depends on how much you are willing to put up with to get to the monster. Overall, I'm pleased with the reboot. The king is back and next movie needs to be intense. I feel Edwards was afraid to just go all out with this movie and make it a monster bash for fear of harsh criticism, so they really tried to use human feeling in this, that's fine and all, but I would hope at some point we can get to a monster bash movie. I won't complain too much, but with all these visual effects, a destroy all monsters type movie would instantly be one of the greatest movies of all time in my opinion. I will give Godzilla (2014) an 8/10. Good movie, not a great movie, +points because GODZILLA",

Loved  the  various makeovers down through the  years  as 'zilla went  from the  ass kicking,  one  lizard demolition crew to  being downright  cute in the  70s and  back to  being  a sleep  deprived threat to humanity ( lemme tell ya...i'd  be  pissed  too if someone awakened  me  from a sound  sleep) and in the late  90s  found a niche as  Doritos spokeslizard. Yes,  i  have  the  nerve  to  refer  to tht debacle of  a  movie tht in  '98 tht should  have remained on  the  cutting room  floor. The  only  thing  tht  saved  this  movie from  a  much  lower  rating were the  special effects (hence  the rating  of  ''7'')  along with the presence  of  Bryan  Cranston,  Ken  Watanabe, Juliette Binoche and  let  us not  forget the  true  star  of this movie  Godzilla  who  has of course  been working out (check the well toned abs and beautiful white teeth and those  ''guns''...niiiiiice! ). After  having  read  the  various  reviews for this  movie,  i've  noticed the  many laments of  ''not  enough  screen  time or the  murky darkness.  At  first glance,  i too was  wondering why the  film  was so  dark  and then i saw the  final  fight between  Godzilla and the  the  mutos  and then it  hit me: if  the  fight  was  staged  in broad  daylight it  would  have a devastating effect  visually...a  waste  of  perfectly  good special  effects and who  needs tht? I  watch to be amazed...to  feel the  same thrill and  awe I  did when i  first saw the  original Gojira. I  wanted  to see  his signature move and have  it  blow me  away  and  it  did just  tht!  His  roar was incredible (awesome sound effects) ..the  mutos  could've  used a little  more ....originality in  their   design but  were  overall menacing enough to  pass muster and  quite possibly   scare the candy  corn  out  of u if u  happen to  be below the  age of twelve. Because of the  length of  the  movie i'm not entirely  certain tht  children  would  be patient  enough to wait for  the  King of  the  Monsters appearance but once  he  does show it  is well worth the  wait.  Ok.   Anyone taking bets  on whether there's  a sequel in the  works? Hopefully,  the  makers   will improve upon the this  treasured  franchise enough  to  do it  justice.",

It has good characters that actually feel real, which is unique considering that most monster movie characters feel bland. However since there is more time donated to the humans in the film the monster aren't seen as much as I would like. Which leads to my biggest problem with the film, the monster fights are cut short. Most of the time in the movie we only see the beginning and end of the fight meaning we don't get to enjoy what made Godzilla infamous. Also they changed Godzilla's origin's, from an experiment gone wrong to a giant creature who lived in prehistoric times while feeding of radiation to survive, yet Godzilla lives at the bottom of the ocean so how does it get radiation? In conclusion if your a long time fan of Godzilla you might want to steer clear, but if you just some one looking for good movie then sit down and give this movie a watch.",

      "text": "Looking back at this movie, the characters actually all fall flat. Some are just there cuz plot, whereas the ones that serve importance just sort of stand around planning how to kill Godzilla and the other two monsters. Elizabeth Olsen is only there to make you care about whether or not Aaron Taylor-Johnson's character survives to the end, which is something that Bryan Cranston's character did not succeed in doing, even though he should've. In my opinion, he was the best character in the movie, as he predicted that the monsters would eventually overpower the humans, but, when they did, he ended up getting killed. What? Why? I wish his character would've lasted longer just to see what he could've done. In the final battle scene, Godzilla does all the work in killing the two monsters, whereas the other soldiers all get themselves killed, and Aaron Taylor-Johnson runs off and tries to fight the monsters himself, but realizes how stupid he is being and cowers in fear, waiting for help to arrive. The only reason he survived is because his father was already dead and he had a wife and young son, however, if he didn't have that, and his character was just a miserable loser, the movie could've gotten away with killing him off. The special effects in this movie were absolutely phenomenal, and whoever edited this film should've won Best Editing at the Oscars. So, the characters just fall flat completely, but the special effects and monster scenes make up for that loss with their sheer scale and awesomeness.",

Godzilla is only in the movie for about eleven minutes, which wouldn't be as much of a problem if the human characters were interesting. Sadly, the only human character I cared about was Bryan Cranston, who dies about half an hour into the movie, leaving us with his bland, much less interesting son, who has little to no personality or charisma. Then, just as it seems we are finally about to get the rampaging monster action that the whole movie has been building up to, they ruin it by shrouding all the action in near-total darkness and throwing in two extra monsters that are in the movie more than Godzilla himself. Overall, this movie is a mess. It's full of tension-building without payoff, and spends about 17 minutes of its run time focusing on the main character trying to save a child who has no purpose in the plot. If you want a good creature-feature, I'd recommend Cloverfield or The Beast From 20000 Fathoms.",
