Director Patrick Hughes never finds the plot of the film, you are left wondering what happened to that guy or where is that guy gone to. The action is good, plot? Not so much. Mel Gibson, as the villain, was good. The acting is okay, Stallone and supporting are good. TE3 is full of cameos as well. Wow, A LOT of cameos. Well, I can't say it's the best film of the series.

I grew up watching these action movie legends and to have all of them together in one flick is a dream come true. However this third one turned away a bit from what fans like me wanna see in an Expendables movie - these legends! I didn't like how Jet Li had such a small role (and not even one fight scene), yet they give Kellan Lutz or Victor Ortiz so much more screen time. I mean who cares about these guys in a movie like this? Rousey is also a terrible actress and I think the fight scenes all together were a lot worse than in the previous ones. However there were positives as well, like Wesley Snipes for example! The man is still a presence on screen and he is still kickin' ass. Banderas also brought some fun into the action and Mel Gibson played his villain role well. Though here is another thing I didn't like. You just never felt like the bad guys are powerful enough. They couldn't kill anyone and the only person who got shot was Terry Crews, which resulted in giving one of the best characters such a minor role (again). So I'm not surprised it failed at the box office, I mean it is still a solid action flick, just not worthy for the franchise. Hope there will be a fourth one though, because The Expandables still have potential, and a group of super villains (with action stars like Steven Seagal, Dwayne Johnson, Michael Jai White, Milla Jovovich or Donnie Yen) against the group of heroes could be an awesome final showdown.",

But this year, I kinda lost touch with the 3rd movie. The first 2 was beyond awesome showcasing 80's and 90's action gems into nothing more than a testosterone Rambo meets Road House-style nostalgic reminisce of kick-ass guns blazing action. The 3rd, however, is kinda dumb and not in a good way. For starters, the new cast is weak (except \"Rowdy\" Ronda Rousey, the first female UFC women's champion, she did a great job in her first acting role) because I don't know why who told it would be a great idea to add an action nobody Kellan Lutz (from the crappy Legend of Hercules), an MMA legend (Victor Ortiz), the actor from \"The Goonies,\" and an unknown actor (Glen Powell) to be in the list of weared-down action heroes. The action scenes were almost as good as usual, but they toned down the violence and the blood that was supposed to be covered were dreadful. The script is lackluster at best, character conversations feels like Love Connection, there's no Jet Li on it, and But the biggest problem is that they make an excuse to make this an unnecessary PG-13 rating to aim less on mature audiences an drew at kids and parents as well. Adding insult to injury, it was the piracy to blame for this one-note joke of a sometimes almost good sequel. Maybe the studio just thought about this to happen once it was released three weeks before the movie even have to wait to buy it on DVD once the movie's run in the theater is over. And that's leading to the supposed downfall of The Expendables. I know they're making a 4th film soon, but can they just end the series right about now? I'm not saying the movie is terrible and all, but my only concern is Arnie and Sly's action movie status. I think it's about time they should hang it up and retire because there's not much left for the fans what they want in a action movie.",

Sure, it had plenty of historic action heroes and some great nostalgic one-liners (Arnie yelling \"get to the choppa\" is gold) and it even had a halfway decent plot, albeit not an entirely original one. The fight scenes were a step down from the previous films and the pacing and plot development wasn't as solid, though neither of the first two really delivered on that front to begin with. I suppose my biggest problems with the movie are two key things. The first is that the film's beginning effectively erases the characters that they established in the first two. Wesley Snipes character comes in and basically points out that Jason Statham and the rest of the expendables are newbies compared to him, even though he's only been locked up for 8 years. While this could be considered nitpicking, the first two films made the team out like a group of guys who have been battle tested for years and years together. Well, considering that the first film takes place four years prior to this one, that means the events of the first film take place with the team together for a maximum of four years, and likely less. I'm sorry but that continuity doesn't vibe. The other thing that I didn't care for was the actual newbies that were introduced to breathe new life into the cast. While I think they don't necessarily do a bad job individually, I just don't think they made sound casting decisions. This franchise has been built on action heroes of the past. If you're going to go young, you need to target the actions heroes of the present. Now certainly nobody expects Dwyane Johnson, Chris Pine, Vin Diesel, Mark Wahlberg, Chris Hemsworth, Sam Worthingston, Tom Hardy, Matt Damon, or any of the other megastars of today to sign on. For one, most of them are a little too old to act as \"young kids\" and simply put, they are stars and don't need this franchise. The money nor wouldn't be right and they likely wouldn't dare touch the films. However, there are other young up-and-comers they could've targeted that would've made better sense, in my opinion, and they could've gotten creative and tried to mirror the megastars of the past. How about using Jason Momoa to take the mantel of the large and physically impressive Arnold Schwarzenegger? He did star in the remake of Conan. They could've even included a joke where Arnie asks him something along the lines of, \"are you trying to replace me, or something?\" What about Tony Jaa? He is probably the next great asian martial artist in the style of Jet Li or Jackie Chan. How about bring him in? I actually loved the idea of Ronda Rousey. Her acting chops are better than Gina Carano's and she represents a new age where women might have a chance at becoming legitimate action heroes. Who's the next Jason Statham or Wesley Snipes (action hero with more of a kickboxing flare)? Honestly, it might be Taylor Lautner. The dude is an absolutely insanely talented martial artist. Why not give him a go? As for the guy who effectively replaces Sly, I think Taylor Kitsch is twice the actor Kellen Lutz is, but Lutz did a decent job so I can't complain there. That being said, doesn't a line up of Kitsch, Momoa, Jaa, and Lautner sound better than Lutz, Victor Ortiz, and Glen Powell? I also must point out that I miss Mickey Rourke's character. He has been absent in these last two and I don't get why. Were there fun explosions and gun battles? Certainly. Was there any real substance beyond that though? Not really.",

Included in this were how Barney's team had to be bigger than ever to fight the baddest guy of them all, Mel Gibson. Harrison Ford and Arnold Schwarzenegger taking part in a machine gun battle from a golf cart, since they obviously can't run anymore, and they even managed to sneak in a joke about Wesley Snipes being in prison for not paying his taxes. New editions included Kellan Lutz, Kelsey Grammer, Ronda Rousey, and various other UFC personalities, leading to a lot more hand to hand stuff than in previous films, but much like the other films, the third installment of the Expendables was an action junkies dream come true. There were non-stop explosions, gun battles, and bodies, all surrounded by a very thin and improbable story. We don't watch these movies for the story or even the characters, we watch these films simply for the adrenaline rush. In that context alone, Expendables 3 hits the target every time, but if you're looking for a good story, great performances, or even a reason behind the madness, then you're watching the wrong series.

If you didn't grow up with movies like Die Hard, Rambo, and Commando then you wouldn't appreciate any of the Expendables and you shouldn't be leaving a review here!

I went into the movie exited to see some decent action and a plot that doesn't take itself too seriously but what i got was plot recycled from the previous movies and it took itself wayyy too seriously for what it was. I dont think anyone understood what the hell was going on in stallones characters head when he was randomly ditching the old crew and recruiting some rookie ones for pretty much no damn reason. Only the end shootout was decent and I loved Mel Gibsons character and his acting skills far surpassed all the other actors. Those 2 points i give to the movie come from the few great scenes delivered by Mel and Schwarzenegger that try breaking the general stiffness of the movie but are too little too late to make this even a decent movie. I sincerely hope no more expendables movies ever come out because 1 and 2 was decent but this was just pure crap.",
