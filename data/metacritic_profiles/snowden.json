On the one hand, he pulled the wool off our eyes and forced us to see what our government become: unhinged.

Stone does a fantastic job of pulling common emotions and you can easily emphasis with the protagonist as the film progresses. My only major complaint is the final seen is ridiculously over the top where a crowd at the end all cheer for Snowden at the end. I think this stripped away the ambiguity of the film and I wish it had been cut.",

      "text": "The best part of Snowden was the lead actor. Joseph Gordon-Levitt does a great job playing Snowden, the camera work was excellent, and the story was simplified to where a general audience could understand it. However, instead of simply telling a straightforward story about the guy, the director infuses his own personal left-wing politics at points and thus, the film becomes a bit cringe-worthy at those points. For example, while Oliver Stone tries to remain neutral and let the audience form their own opinion of Snowden's actions, it's quite clear from the way the story is told that he supports him. In addition, the film doesn't have as much drama as it should have. It's a bit dry emotionally. However, Levitt's fantastic performance and beautiful camera work saves it and makes Snowden an overall decent film.",
