      "text": "Laying on her death bed, Paul McGuire (Nicholas Cage) promises his wife, that he will leave his life of organized crime behind to be there for his daughter. That all changes when a decade later his daughter goes missing. The gloves come off and McGuire connects with his old crew and goes after old enemies to find his daughter. This was an entertaining film, but I think it would have been so much better if it were less violent. I love violent action films as much as the next guy, but the story here calls for a more investigative approach, but all McGuire wants to do is beat people for answers. Nicholas Cage stars and is one of those action stars that never goes out of style. He's been going after the bad guys and surviving impossible odds for nearly three decades, becoming very good at it. Despite being an independent film, Rage has a huge cast with many notable names that really help the story along. In fact, with all the named actors in the film, I'm really surprised that Rage wasn't released in theaters. While being entertaining, Rage isn't anything you haven't seen before, as it's your typical who done it, with all the gun fire and explosions you'd expect from an action movie. The cast is experienced and very good, while the plot does have a back story and moves at a reasonable pace. Rage is one of those film where you don't really have to think and ultimately it is somewhat forgettable, but if you're looking for something to watch without having to think too much, than Rage is a perfect choice and it is currently streaming on Netflix.",

Once he was known as a good actor with the better appearances, but not anymore. This movie was average with a decent story and twist and freshly approached narration, but in the end it did not work. It is kind of a gangster story with a revenge theme. Thank god it did not go on the 'Taken' route. In a few parts I thought that way, then it took a turn moved to the other end with a reasonable end. It was very simple that tells the story of an ex con, who go after some men after his daughter was kidnapped. Kind of to say 'revenge is not after you, but you welcome it when circumstances are in chaos'. Anyway, this movie can be watched once, but don't force yourself because it's not worth.",

Despite not being able to follow the horrendous \"plot-line,\" I was never able to actually enjoy Nicolas Cage's impeccable acting. The action sequences were lackluster and extremely sparse, with cinematography matching that of vine filmed on an iphone 3G. The climax of this movie left me breathless mostly because of how loud I was screaming about how poopy it was. This followed by a terrible ending that leaves many questions to be answered as well as no closure. The only redeeming quality of this awful movie, if I can even call it that, is that Nic Cage stars in it. Do not watch this please, dear god, do not watch.",

Of course, Cage did overact a bit, especially at those rage parts, but he has acted like that all the time, so if you want to see the movie you should know what you are going into anyway if you have seen his other movies which are this type. The movie had some plot twists which weren't that expected and the script was ok. If the acting would have been stronger it would have been a pretty solid movie. Not comparing to others, because I think it's just dumb, then you have to compare each movie to another each time. I think movie stands for it's own and as it's own it was an ok to watch.",
