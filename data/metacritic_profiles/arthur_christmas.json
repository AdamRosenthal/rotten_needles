      "text": "Arthur Christmas does just what a really good Christmas film should - it keeps you absolutely glued to the screen and makes you feel all warm and fuzzy inside. It's expertly animated, slightly satirical, with strong morals and a great voice cast. While everyone gives their all in their vocal performances, of particular note are Hugh Laurie's efficient and coldly business-minded Steve Claus, Bill Nigh's ancient, senile and mischievous Grand Santa and Ashley Jensen's energetic and confident gift-wrapping elf Bryony. The story carries you along nicely, providing a fair amount of visual pizazz, action and humour along the way. Where Arthur Christmas really shines is in the festive message it promotes. The importance of unconditional family love is a common one in Yuletide movies, but somehow it comes across all the more effectively when the film's subjects, the Clauses are an undeniably dysfunctional, fantastic, yet strangely relatable family. Grand Santa is well past his sell-by date, but is not willing to give up the joys of life, or pass up an opportunity to show the younger generation how a job should be done. The current Santa (Jim Broadbent) is good-natured, but a little incompetent, and has never found the time to engage in any real way with his sons. Steve is desperate to do the best job possible and prove himself to be worthy of taking over the family business. Arthur, on the other hand, while inept, clumsy and generally being quite odd, is the only one in the family who seems to still understand, and truly care about the festive season, and what Father Christmas means to children all over the world. The real question is whether he's wise beyond his years or simply naive. The internal struggle within the family is essentially a battle between idealism (Arthur) and pragmatism (Grand Santa, Santa and Steve), and as a result, the film questions what modern Christmas is. Is it simply soulless commercialism, or is it something more? With these deep messages, as well as the simpler joys it provides, Arthur Christmas is certainly something special. It's just a lovely experience that will warm you to your very core, like a mince pie and a glass of mulled wine in front of the fire.",

Arthur Christmas looks fantastic, its got a great voice cast, it's genuinely funny and it works as both a kids and a grown up film. The story is one of the people that work in the north pole. Its the tale of the clumsy Arthur (James McAvoy) who discovers that ,despite the well oiled nature of his families present delivering operation, a child has been missed. The rest of his family doesn't think it matters so Arthur heads out with the only two people on his side, his grandfather (Bill Nighy) and a wrapping department elf (Ashley Jensen). Because its a kids film they get into the usual highjinks but the film never loses itself with its message being one of optimism while maintaining the fast pace and quick wit with both visual and spoken gags being used to great effect. Its thoroughly enjoyable because it captures the spirit of the season while also making fun of it slightly. It gets you in the mood for the holidays and that's what its supposed to do.",

When Santa fails to deliver one present to one little girl, Santa's son Arthur sets out to deliver the present with his old and rather looney grandfather, the former Santa.  The 3D effect used here is amazing and it helps to immerse the viewer in magical worlds of flying animals and winter wonderlands.  Its well worth the surcharge in my opinion.

Thankfully, Arthur Christmas succeeds in doing that. This is a very fun and enjoyable adventure with a funny script and some great comedic timing. It also addresses how christmas isn't like how it used it be. With lots of companies milking up the holidays, it isn't about the family or the spirit anymore, and this movie addresses that in such a hilarious way. The Santa in this movie is not like the Santa that you remember. He doesn't really do that much, instead he has hundreds of elves that enter the houses simultaneously and just drop everything off, and he is just the face of the company. Meanwhile, we have Grandsanta, who complains that his son has gone too commercial. He was by far the funniest character in the movie. Arthur is the protagonist, and is Santa's son. He is such a caring person with an optimistic attitude that did get annoying at times, but overall he is a great character that makes you want to pat him on the back. Steve is Arthurs brother who is the likely replacement of Santa, but i thought his character was rather pointless to be honest, and i didn't really care about him. There is a moment where i thought the film dragged just a little bit, however the last fifteen minutes of this movie make up for that as they're very intense. Overall, Arthurs Christmas is a great movie not just for kids, but also adults. It succeeds in capturing the christmas spirit, and i'm going to give it an 8/10.",
