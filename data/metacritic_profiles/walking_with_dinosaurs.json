As far as the humor goes, only the youngest of audiences will get any laughs. Older audiences like myself will be left rolling their eyes. It makes for a great movie for the young dinosaur fanatic in your house, but that doesn't mean you'll enjoy watching it with them. While I appreciate that the film tries to each kids as much as it tries to make them laugh, the history lesson and childish humor don't mesh together in a way that will make this all that entertaining for their parents. Adults might get a slight kick out of seeing some cool dinosaurs looking great on screen, but this is one for the young dinosaur lovers.

Instead, what we get is a film full of poop jokes, annoying voice acting, and a script that is a rehash of cliches. If they release a silent version of this film, I'll like it, but as is, just don't even bother.",

      "text": "It's one part educational with impressive visuals, and one part goofy kids movie with irritating voice overs and dialog. For every time you learn about how a dinosaur acted or what their name meant, your going to have to deal with the lame jokes tossed out by the characters who just won't shut up. As far as the humor goes, only the youngest of audiences will get any laughs. Older audiences like myself will be left rolling their eyes. It makes for a great movie for the young dinosaur fanatic in your house, but that doesn't mean you'll enjoy watching it with them. While I appreciate that the film tries to each kids as much as it tries to make them laugh, the history lesson and childish humor don't mesh together in a way that will make this all that entertaining for their parents. Adults might get a slight kick out of seeing some cool dinosaurs looking great on screen, but this is one for the young dinosaur lovers. The younger the better, and there's not necessarily anything wrong with that. My total score for the film is a 6.4/10=Okay.",
