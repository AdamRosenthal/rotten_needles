Not sure I care that much for Brett Ratner's back catalogue, but he's certainly proved himself worthy with this one.  As does the ever-charismatic Dwayne Johnson (who has all the charm of the pre-public-boob-fondling Schwarzeneggar, plus some genuine acting talent), and as for John Hurt...well, he has nothing to prove to any of us, hasn't for decades, but it's always wonderful to see him in a major role in a major Hollywood blockbuster every once in a while (and nice to see he's not dead yet, for that matter).",

On the one hand, I really like what Ratner tried to do in making the myth and lore of Hercules just that; myth and lore. He made the character simply a fantastic warrior and eventual mercenary who, along with the help of his comrades, played into the living legend in order to acquire jobs and terrify his enemies. I mean, who would want to go toe-to-toe with the mighty Hercules? The problem with the film is that Ratner doesn't leave the fantastical at the door as he should've. On the one hand, he portrays Hercules as a mortal and mocks the existence of hydra, centaurs, and cerberus. On the other hand he includes a psychic who can see visions of the future and he has Dwayne Johnson's Hercules perform superhuman feats that no mere mortal could do. Many of the action and battles sequences also fail here, with Hercules leveling many a foe with a single swing of his club. This identity crisis doesn't ruin the viewing experience completely but it does hinder the film's ability to create serious drama or intrigue. This film ultimately feels a bit shallow and the underutilization of Irina Shayk might be the biggest disappointment of the entire movie. She seemed to get half of the screen time in the trailers but gets maybe 30 seconds of screen time in the actual film. That's called poor representation. Overall, it's a decent watch and one of the better live action Hercules films I've seen but it fails to live up to its potential, largely due to poor direction.",

A \u00fanica coisa admir\u00e1vel nesse filme \u00e9 o tamanho de Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson, que a cada vez que a aparece em algum filme, aparenta estar maior ainda!!! Ele, como H\u00e9rcules, \u00e9 bem convincente... mais pelo tamanho em si do que pela interpreta\u00e7\u00e3o!! Enfim, o filme n\u00e3o empolga, n\u00e3o inova, n\u00e3o surpreende. Eu, n\u00e3o recomendo. \u00c9 o t\u00edpico filme que ir\u00e1 cair em esquecimento muito r\u00e1pido. Isso se j\u00e1 n\u00e3o caiu!!!",

The best way to enjoy a popcorn flick like this, is to eat lots of popcorn and enjoy the raw nonsense that ensues. The movie fails to deliver in terms of narrative story and character development, and is designed for the over the top action sequences it excels at. Whilst one cannot admit that this is a good film, it did provide for a fun movie experience that I don't regret engaging in.",
