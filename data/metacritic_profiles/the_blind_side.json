      "text": "Upon seeing the trailer for The Blind Side, I had a good idea how I would react. Upon viewing the final product, my suspicions were validated. Its heart is entirely in the wrong place. The movie ought to be about Michael Oher and how he achieved success, but this is not the case. The Blind Side centers around the kind Southern white woman who takes in an underprivileged black youth. Her kindness, not his struggle, is what the movie is about. To the actors' credit, everyone does a good job. The leads are mostly great, especially Quinton Aaron, but the direction and writing undercuts the performances. The Blind Side is all uplift and no substance. When the movie isn't trying to win your heart with its blatant emotional pandering, it's trying to warm it with sentiment-heavy and sitcom-lite humor, a rather nauseating combination. Also problematic is the unflattering portrait of African Americans. In the movie's eyes, if black people aren't waiting for kind white folk to lend a helping hand, they are either unable to support their families or are manipulative bullies. I suppose there is one business-professional African American woman, but it's telling that she is introduced as a villain. There are moments in The Blind Side where a better movie shines through, one with both the appropriate seriousness and sweetness for the situation, but this better movie is largely overshadowed by the mediocre one in the foreground. It is sadly telling about the state of film when movies like this are nominated for Best Picture.",

Or sometimes you do not even know why you are doing something; and honor is the real reason either you do something or you don\u2019t, is who you are or maybe who you want to be. Apart from that is captivating the title of the picture; it is called the blind side because every time something bad happened during his difficult childhood the protagonist closed his eyes.

Quinton Aaron plays one of the most loveable role I have ever seen and a movie and he does it by speaking very few words considering he is in a lead role. That is something to be proud off. Sandra Bullock also plays one of the best performances if not the best performance of her career. I need to watch more of her stuff. Plus the supporting characters are just so good and the family is just so cute like Tim McGraw is like the perfect father figure. Jae Head and Aaron had unlikely chemistry and their scenes are some of the highlights of the film. This film just shows that there are people willing to go beyond the call of duty for basically no personal gain and all it took was a little structure to make Michael Oher well established young man.",

Sandra Bullock is perfect in her role, she brings to life MLK's words: judge people not by the color of their skin but on the content of thier character.  And by doing this, she is able to help the talented teen Michael Oher.  Also I loved supporting actress Lily Collins' character. A very well-done movie in all aspects!",
