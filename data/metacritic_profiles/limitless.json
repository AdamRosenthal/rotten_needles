      "text": "What do you get when you take an original, novel-inspired premise that has \"Limitless\" potential and injest it with Hollywood flair? A film engaging enough to make you think differently; atleast until you leave the theater. The popcorn thriller delivers, but not to the level it could have. \"Limitless\" is a film that falls into the unfortunate trap of overcomplexity. With this entrenching influence, comes gaping flaws. Before we examine such flaws, let's start with what we see on the surface. We are introduced to a charming, amiable protagonist in Cooper, who the viewer, can easily take an affinity towards. He is the vehicle for the film's effectiveness. In his role, Cooper is the \"face\" of the film's every expression, where we see and feel Morra's dissatisfaction with the status quo, and the urgency to make something of ourselves. This connection between character and self will \"do\" it for some, but that is just the start. Next is the visuals. Once we are embraced by the presence of NZT-48, the filmmakers' efforts to illustrate the endless capabilities of the drug is impressive to say the least. The world becomes bright, the scenery all makes sense, the sounds more resonant, and life's once grim lenses are now pure as ever. You throw in a couple notable supporters, (Abbie Cornish and Robert De Niro) and you have yourself a pretty enjoyable trip to the theaters, right? Perhaps, for some. This is my problem with \"Limitless.\" Once you make your way past the topical layers of the film, (cast, fast pace, visual effects) which are done tediously, there isn't any substance left, and to fill up time, the filmmakers are forced to add unneeded \"fluff\" that strays from the effectiveness of the film as in the protagonist's moral and internal struggle to weigh the consequences of power, and a desire to revert to \"normal life\" and make something of himself naturally. This is almost entirely neglected after the premise, where Hollywood's true colors are readily shown. Here is  where I begin to lose the direction of the film. Cooper's girlfriend has clearly left him in the beginning of the film, but comes back to him on a whim once he has taken the drug. Now it seems that a drug, said to allow use to use 100 % of your brain has the power to attract and give of pheremones? Interesting, yet silly.  What else is ludicrous is the seeminly unlimited supply of the drug. When Morra's ex-brother-in-law dies he finds one bag of pills, yet it seems another two or three bags are spawned over the course of the film. One of the most moronic of all plot flaws is the unnecessary involvement with the Russian loan-shark. Now, if you had the brilliance of Morra and had earned large sums of money in the stock market (which seems a bit unrealistically whimsical as well) where is the logical practicality in borrowing $100,000, and even so, when he had come out on top of the investment ($2.5 million), why would he fail to pay back the amount. The loan-shark's usage of NZT also has little to offer to the film's direction. Recalling instruction on \"how\" to fight as in the subway, also seems \"far-fetched\" when taking into account the pill's function: using all one's brain-not muscle memory. Other instances of absurdity take flight when Morra's girlfriend runs across an ice-rink (in shoes-across ice...) and picks up a child while having the strength and reaction (not traits of the drug) to lift a child up and manuever the blade of a skate flawlessly into the path of an intruder. The film's last 10-15 minutes is what really drove me over the edge of sanity. Where does drinking one's blood become a key to safety in suspense? Now granted it is unique, the logic seems suspect. Just when you thought \"Twilight\" Series couldn't be more of a pop-culture hit....Aside from the many other plot holes and moral ambiguity, \"Limitless\" is a fun roller-coaster, thriller of a ride that will make you think......only after the credits have rolled.",

      "text": "Let the eye-rolling begin. It's the customary reaction whenever you tell people you that you're writing a novel. Let their eyes roll, you think, because on a good day, you literally feel like a god, as the words congest the previously white spaces of the page teeming with life; the life that you invented from the brain you would kiss on the cerebellum if the law of physics permitted it. But not everyday spent in Bohemia is a happy one. The prospective writer, just like Eddie Morra(Bradley Cooper), can sit at his desk and produce nothing for hours on end, abiding by the \"stay in the room\" principle to no avail, while people in the outside world with real jobs lead productive and fulfilling lives. An unsuccessful writer can suck the life out of your very being. Tired of being a \"cleaning lady\" and \"bank\", the writer's girlfriend, Lindy(Abby Cornish), indicates her preference for those punch the clock types when she dumps him, even though, you would think, an editor would have more patience than most women, since she is in the book biz. Before things can get any worse, Eddie has a fortuitous run-in with his ex-brother-in-law, Vernon(Johnny Whitworth), who gives him a special pill, a black market substance called NZT, which is designed to maximize the brain's potential, and in Eddie's case, cures his writer's block and allows him to finish the novel. \"Limitless\" should have stayed on this path, a writing path, instead of veering off into more sexy narrative terrain. With all that access to the brain's potential, Eddie could have started a new religion and be its charismatic spokesperson. \"Limitless\" could have been a treatise about the dangers of rhetoric, but the film is just not that ambitious, so it settles on being a dumb generic thriller about high financing on Wall Street, conspiracies, and who ultimately has control over the magic pills. The moviegoer doesn't care how NZT affects a Russian loan shark, since, in Vernon's words, \"it works better if you're already smart.\" Turning his back on Bohemia, Eddie becomes a financial wizard, in which \"Limitless\" then gets bogged down with deadly boring talk about corporate mergers, involving Van Loon(Robert DeNiro), who wants this newbie to restructure his deal. \"Limitless\" forgets that it had the makings of a pretty nifty science-fiction mindbender. Under NZT, large chunks of time go unaccounted for, and as a result, Eddie may or may not have murdered a socialite in a hotel room. A detective questions him, but he is never formally charged. It's as if he's getting away with murder. Since Eddie, at one point, drinks another man's blood laced with NZT, it's hard not to connect \"Limitless\" with the Christian Bale character in Mary Harron's ultra-violent \"American Psycho\", whose Patrick Bateman also gets away with murder. Both films touch on the superficial nature of society. Curiously, \"Limitless\" is quite limited in its scope. Anybody can make a killing on the market, or run for the senate. With a better script, Eddie would rule the world.",

What if there was a pill which allowed you access and use 100% of your brain instead of the usual 20% we may use sans pharmaceuticals?  You could recall every single memory, word you read, place you saw, conversation you had, etc...  Unfortunately, the pill wears off in the morning and if you use too much of it, you're headed in a downward spiral and a bad ending.  The idea of a pill which could produce those effects is wonderfully original and fun for the audience to watch what a guy can accomplish on it.  The guy here is Bradley Cooper, a failing and lazy writer.  Cooper is not your trypical leading man and it's a far cry from his early 'Alias' episodes.  Robert DeNiro also shows up in a supporting role which took me out of the film while I watched Robert DeNiro instead of a character actor who would have most likely kept me more engaged.  This is an odd role for DeNiro, very sidelined and not much room to show off.  The camera work stood out as well with some nifty tricks as the camera proceeds along the streets of New York in seemingly one shot.  What does not work is a gangster plotline which interrupts the flow and throws a wrench a bit into how the smartest guy in the world could forget to pay off a loan shark and other bonehead moves but overall, here a great idea which is explored effectively for most, but not the whole, film.",

Maybe it's not \"epic\", but it has no significant flaws:  The central concept (take drug/ get really smart/ try to keep things from spinning out of control) is immediately intriguing. The acting has no seriously weak links-- and Bradley Cooper is outstanding. He has at least one very good scene with Robert DeNiro and has a great mix of \"inner con artist\" mixed with \"do the right thing\" that play off each other throughout the movie.  The special effects felt just right to me-- I got a good sense of what the drug was doing without feeling like the effects were cheesy. And the soundtrack was great. I have rarely been so engaged for an entire film-- and even the ending surprised me.

The high-point of Limitless are the incredible shots provided by Neil Burger and Jo Willems used to describe the effect of the drug or the sensational lingering non stop zooms of New York City.
