I have been, on-and-off, a roleplayer AND gamemaster myself throughout my 40 years on this plane of existence, and to say that this film is one of the most well-observed and accurate portrayals of not only \"gamers\", but indeed anyone of a decidedly \"obsessive\" nature, is quite an understatement.  What starts out as an only slightly darker version of The Big Bang Theory gradually, inexorably transforms into full-blown black comedy and, by its conclusion, just flat-out poignant drama.  More and more, I found myself watching certain scenes unfold through the gaps of my fingers whilst muttering words such as \"Oh no, dude, oh Lord no, DON'T...\"  Make no mistake, it's THAT uncomfortable at times.",
