My friend wanted to leave during the agonizing first half, but we stayed to the bitter end (I never leave any movie that I shell out bucks to see).  The first half is as bad as it gets and you wonder to yourself how a movie like this even gets the green light from a studio to be released.  The movie does pick up in the second half, however it is still totally predictable and unoriginal.  You have to blame the script writers for this stinker - the actors can only do so much with bad dialogue.",
