      "text": "I think I'm a minority on my stance towards this movie. I don't have mixed feelings about it just to be edgy and apart from everyone else, it just rubbed me a little differently. I was largely absent from all the hype that surrounded it when it was released: I finally saw the movie towards the end of its theatrical run. With that being said, I had a much clearer perspective on it, seeing it in a theater with maybe 10 other people in it, and I can honestly say after seeing it, it's one of the most overrated movies of all time. For starters, I think the movie takes itself too seriously. At it's core, the plot is essentially an updated version of \"Pocahontas\" or \"Dances With Wolves.\" I was genuinely entertained for the first half hour, in which you're introduced to the main characters and the setting of Pandora, but then movie started to take another turn. The whole thing was simply overshadowed by this very self-righteous, naturalist message about how we have to take care of the planet. Now don't get me wrong, I care for the environment, but when I feel like I'm watching a $300,000,000 EPA PSA, it kind of ruins the effect of a movie that comes from the director of Terminator 2. Throughout the movie, various other sci-fi elements are taken from movies like the Matrix and Jurassic Park, and subsequently accompanied by video game quality dialogue. In a word -- it's all over the place and just comes off sappy. Rather than a sophisticated narrative geared towards adults, Cameron just decided to go completely Saturday morning cartoon with this one, causing tons of merchandise and distribution out the ass that caters mainly to middle school boys who take garbage like this too seriously. But hey, it has amazing special effects, so I guess the it's saving grace is the familiarity of the director, and that it looks pretty.",

      "text": "There's a certain something to be said about the power of a visually strong movie like Avatar. It's kinda like a sleazy, but charismatic sales person. You like the person while your in his office, cause he just reeks of charm (or cigarettes) and you buy in to his pitch, cause he's good at what he does, but when you leave the store, you find that you really didn't like the product that much after all. That's kinda how I feel about Avatar. The movie's visuals are amazing and I would say that nothing will be defeating it anytime soon as far as that goes. But when you brush away all that, what you're left with isn't necessarily a bad movie, but an average to ok one. I say this because most of the time I spent watching it was marveling at the amazing visuals that Cameron's team presented us. That part I can't heap enough praise on, but other than that, the story of the movie pretty much comes across as a straight up black and white morality play. I can understand the \"it's just a movie\" that people may say to that kind of suggestion, but where it doesn't hold up is when you try to pass the movie off as a political/social statement about our society. Nothing in reality is ever black and white, and to do so discredits a lot of what makes us a very complicated, arrogant, and interesting species. Aside from it's horrid attempts to justify why our material world is wrong, the story presents the humans as evil, greedy, and violent; but the Na'vi are peaceful, harmonious, and coexist with nature. Of course the main character ends up going native, finds he likes the tribe more, and then sides with them in the upcoming inevitable bloodbath, and the usual sequence of most big budget movies plays out with no originality whatsoever. Still the movie does entertain, even though it provides a mixed message, and there are some very interesting moments. The real credit to Avatar is the level of thought put into the actual world itself, and here the production/design team did a remarkable job in making Pandora a reality. To me it's a shame that they went for a more simplified story of good and evil as opposed to something more complex and real, but I guess that was never their intention in the first place. It probably wouldn't have been as successful in the theatres if it was. A simple message doesn't mean a bad one, but in this case it was more of a typical one.",

Over-budgeted production cost, the lure of 3D to draw viewers, manipulative characters and political messages, and the complete lack of depth in the characters and story plague this beautiful looking film. To say that this film is bad would be a lie, but I despise this film so much due to it's one-dimensional characters and predictable and unoriginal story. James Cameron has done some great work in his career (The Terminator films, Aliens, [and even] Titanic), but Avatar is not among that prestigious list. Avatar only goes to prove that visual effects and action scenes do not guarantee a good film. For example, 12 Angry Men is one of the greatest films ever and it contains no action, CGI, and lacks multiple locations; the entire appeal of the film lies in its strong characters, dialogue, premise, and confrontations. Avatar lacks all these quintessential elements, and therefore suffers.",

Having seen the movie, I would agree that the premise is nowhere near unique, but to me originality shouldn't be the basis for judging the quality of a film. More than anything a truly great movie should be striking, and Avatar is precisely that. James Cameron used his budget ($237m) to create one of the most engrossing environments to ever grace the screen, and pushed the 3D technology (which I don't even like) to the limit. The result is pure spectacle; behind me in the movie theater there was a family with three children and throughout the 2 1/2 hours there were constant exclamations of \"Wow!\" and \"Oohh!\" I would have been slightly annoyed had I not realized I wanted to say the same things, and for a movie to revert a hardened critic like me to a world of pure escapist wonder, I have to give the film credit.",

At times my jaw dropped at how uninspired the lines were. \"I see you\" in particular feels cheesy and overused. Then there is the awful love story. It is without a doubt one of the worst development of a couple I have ever seen in a film. We go from Nyteri HATING Jake to them occasionally nudging each other and laughing to...well them doing under the tree of souls or whatever it's  called. I know months have passed in the story, but only 45 minutes have passed to us, and nothing in the film explained or showed how their feelings grew for each other. Giving someone a meaningful look once doesn't count as developing a couple. To top it off, this movie is excruciatingly long. By the time you see it for the second or third time you will be constantly checking your watch. It just won't end! The film could have easily cut 20-30 minutes.

The expressions on the faces of the characters are scaringly un-canny, and the same goes for the environment in which they live in. However all that said, there are some downfalls of this film. For example, the story is extremely thin. It is very easy to get caught up in the beauty of this film, and forget about the cliche full narative, that frankly, if you noticed how bad it was, leaves you feeling like a bit of a sucker. It follows an ex marine called Sam, and is set in the decade of 2050. It starts on board a space ship, that is approaching a fictional planet named 'Pandora'. We later learn that it contains a very valuable substance, and thus why the Americans decide to invade. Sam is chosen, and this is where the 'Avatar' comes in. It is basically a suit that he wears during the time he is in the simulation pod (that allows him to travel to Pandora) it disguises him as one of the 'Na'vi' (the big blue aliens). His goal is to persaude the Na'vi to move away. However in typical fashion he falls in love with one of the indeginous, and we have a classic story. A sort of good cop bad cop scenerio. The good guy being Sam who decides to betray the US and save the Na'vi. The bad guy being an Army General that wants to invade, however he did resemble a character from Toy Soldiers. Without giving away too much, we end up with a happy ending, that like I said earlier, fails to satisfy. However, if you mangage to ignore the story, and just marvel at the CGI, you will be pleased, this is one you have to see on the big screen though, and if you can, see it in 3D.

And at the end, the humans find negotiation with Pandora and 'wisen' up to their ways (because we violent humans are utterly stupid according to the story. Yes, that means you). No, the movie didn't even do that. It gave no room for redemption, and practically insults you on a personal level. Next Point: If the evil business man was really after wealth, he would've stopped the operation to gather ore. He would've gone after the wealth of medical, biological, and sociological knowledge which would have made him insanely more rich than mining would. And finally, there is the point that many people have brought up: It's a total rip-off. Pocahontas, Dances with Wolves, Fern Gully, Aliens, and Storm Troopers have all been brought up which means the storyline is over used. Movie was highly overrated, critics either don't know their sh*t, are politically biased, or are too gutless to truly critique the film. A great big middle finger to the message of the film, and much love to the artists who made such a beautiful world. Shame on those who shallowly rated the film based upon appearances.",

But no, this wanker **** their leaders daughter, attacks humans, starts a **** war, kills all the humans and is presented as some kind of role model. **** **** Something like $7billion spent on this film. Probably spent on tipping of critics so they give it a good score. A **** predictable story with HD slapped on its huge ass. Waste of space.",

Not as great as his classics such as Aliens or T2, but more palatable for the masses. At its heart, it's a love story told countless before. This simplicity allows it to become a film that transcend different cultures, but it is also its main weakness.

The story may have been done many times before, but it's still very engaging.  There are moments that are powerfully charged with emotion, the direction is flawless, and the scope and scale are both breathtaking.  There is also an extremely resonant atmosphere throughout.  James Cameron has created what is quite possibly his best film.  It's an instant classic, full of deeply human and resonant emotion, groundbreaking visuals, and viscerally stunning action.  My only real complaint is that the dialogue can be somewhat clunky, but the rest of the movie quickly sends this to the realm of nitpicking.

Because Pandora's atmosphere is toxic, they have created the Avatar Program, in which human \"drivers\" have their consciousness linked to an avatar, a remotely-controlled biological body that can survive in the lethal air. These avatars are genetically engineered hybrids of human DNA mixed with DNA from the natives of Pandora... the Na'vi. Reborn in his avatar form, Jake can walk again. He is given a mission to infiltrate the Na'vi, who have become a major obstacle to mining the precious ore. But a beautiful Na'vi female, Neytiri, saves Jake's life, and this changes everything. Jake is taken in by her clan, and learns to become one of them, which involves many tests and adventures. As Jake's relationship with his reluctant teacher Neytiri deepens, he learns to respect the Na'vi way and finally takes his place among them.

      "text": "I'll admit, with all of the hype that surrounded this film, I was sceptical as to how good it could actually be, and was waiting for it to fail. Oh, how wrong was I? Avatar is a brilliant film. I saw this in 3D earlier this year, and in 2D just the other day, so I feel I can give a review that isn't biased with just one setting of the films view. I'll just clear the air, state the obvious here and leave it in the dust: The film in 3D is an AMAZING experience. The way in which you see these spectacles James Cameron has created, it will burn itself into your memory in a good way. 2D has you focus less on the spectacles and more on things like the story and the characters. Now, to the films actual review Avatar is the tale of Jake Sully, a soldier who takes over from his dead brother on a science project, which temporarily has his mind transferred into an Avatar body, to help the military in their quest to take a substance from Pandora (the planet). From there on, he lives amongst the Na'vi (the race the Avatar body is based upon) and begins doubting where his allegiance lies. I'll admit, the plot isn't anything complex or original. It's been done before, and you can basically guess where the plot's going to go. \"They're gonna rebel\" \"His truth will be discovered\" \"He's gonna question his motives\". And you knew they only introduced the Toruk so Jake could master it. Also, was I the only one who didn't like the guy playing the boss? I mean, he was great in Friends and My Name Is Earl, in comedy roles, but for something serious like this, it just didn't seem to suit him. And the oxygen on Pandora was toxic to the humans. How exactly does it work? Stephen Lang's character had quite a time of exposure to it (when chasing them escaping on the helicopter, when he shot Grace) and seemed fine. And Jake as well. He was exposed for an amount of time, possibly longer, and ended up fine. Anyway, thats the negatives out of the way. Now the positives The world of Pandora and its inhabitants was a marvel to behold, even in 2D. James Cameron has a very creative mind. Just look at all of the creatures, from the Hammerheads, to the four-armed monkeys. Not just that, the technology as well.How info could be moved from one screen to another with just a flick of the wrist, and the handcuffs. I'll say it again, James Cameron is one creative guy, with one hell of an imagination. Shame about his acceptance speeches, though..... The way CGI contrasted with the humans. It didn't seem to contrast much. When (Avatar) Jake was carrying Grace, it didn't seem like one big clash of reality and Computer Generated Images, they seamed together perfectly, like two pieces of a puzzle clicking together. I liked how the characters developed. How Grace went from a no-nonsense **** to how she was warm and a good friend to Jake and Norm. I especially liked how Norm changed from a goofy scientist to him punching out officers and joining in the big battle. The final battle: What a marvel! Just the contrast of the flying Dragons (or whatever they are) versus the gunships. Just basically how it was Nature VS Machinery. I think it's safe to say that there was no shortage of awesomeness within that battle. Shame Tsu'tey was killed off. Just as I was getting to like him. Once Jake first woke up in his Avatar, when he first went from standing up to running through the outdoors, I felt for him because in human form, he's confined to that wheelchair, but as a Na'vi, he's no longer confined. I also felt James Cameron placed some parallels for the Iraq war within the movie. One group going to another land in order to take something that they wish, resulting in a battle. And Stephen Lang! His turn as a villian is quite menacing, especially in the cold hearted way he just bombs the Tree, the home of the Na'vi. I felt that he was the perfect counterfoil for Sam Worthington's Jake Sully. All in all: It may seem like it mainly concentrates on the visuals, and it's plot development may be by numbers, but this is definately a film you must watch!",

Every character in this movie is a cliche'  or a stereotype such as The Austrailian-American Mariene, The Scientist, The War Hardened Badass, The Egotystical Buisinessman, and many more! And what little of a story AVATAR has is covered up by the horendous CGI. The technology behind the CGI is impressive but it is hardly artful often lacking patern and flow, or anything else visually appealing. Instead they overuse CGI in what can only be described as a head-ache indusing high contrast orgy. The movie is way too long as well. It would be nice if it served as a 10 minute tech demo, but the 3 hour embarassment to all things filmlovers truely value is less than nessary. In conclusion If you want to remain brain dead for 3 hours of your life and leave the theatere with no questions, need for thought, or questioning morality, watch avatar. If you truely value films, please skip this movie!",

Which in this day and age reminds one too much about the American empire projected into the future to the nth degree of violence and sheer stupidity, with all its arrogance and capitalistic values.  A great message to the rest of the non American, non Western world . . .  The irony is, it is made by a Canadian who comes from a country that is the opposite of imperialistic.  If I didn't think that Cameron takes himself too seriously to do otherwise, I would think that he mocks America by using every clich\u00c3\u00a9 there is in American cinematography and serving it up to them as if to say:  here, as ugly as that country's culture and values come.",

From his filmography, such as: ALIENS (1986), TERMINATOR (1984), TERMINATOR 2: JUDGEMENT DAY (1991), TRUE LIES (1994), and TITANIC, we should not doubt Cameron resume. In 1997, TITANIC won 11 Oscars, to be equal with BEN-HUR (1959) as all-time best achievement in Academy Awards. Casts of AVATAR are: Sam Worthington, Michelle Rodriguez, Giovanni Ribisi, and Sigourney Weaver (who already became Fighter-woman Icon in Cameron ALIENS).  Thiz movie has a unique story that reflects the originality of the script. While we were watching AVATAR, made us did not realized that 90% of the movie is actually animation. The technology itself has reached the new level of breakthrough. They definitely already set up the bar so high to be challenge in the coming years. The stunning moment that I like to watch over and over again is the night scene of forest landmark. The forest describe fills with unique plants shine and glow on surroundings. There is something mystique and beautiful about that scene. The great thing I like about AVATAR is that the theme about environmental issue is very strong. Overall, in my opinion, Thiz movie also had a tremendous hidden-philosophy inside about human need, environmental, and human heart. Like I said before, Open your eyes, The dream is over.. Close your eyes, It is still a dream. The Blue-man rocks!",

What they don't tell you is that the plot is basically written by a 5-year old. Avatar is a big, fat, tired old clich\u00c3\u00a9 with a dazzling new paint job. Most of the \"plot\" is derived from old and often better material, basically the whole \"Sorry about Colonialism\"- and \"The Noble Savage\"-genres that include movies and books such as Dances with Wolves, A Man Called Horse, The Last Samurai, The Last of the Mohicans, Dune, Lawrence of Arabia, Ferngully, Pocahontas, Robinson Crusoue, The Thin Red Line, Moby Dick and many, many, many others. The acting, while not bad is not memorable either, nor are the many stock character suck as Jake and Grace. In fact, Avatar has none of the hallmarks of a classic: great script, superior acting, memorable characters that you root for or even suspence or immersion. Everyone is so wooed by the visuals, but great visual by itself doesn't make a good movie. I doubt people will look back to this movie in 50 years time and consider it a classic, especially in ten years time when the CGI starts to look really dated. At it's best Avatar is a good popcorn movie, you sit awed for about two hours but after that it's easily forgettable, and it deserves nothing better.",

However the problem is that to have an epic story you usually do not have the room to add a personal side to the film. Avatar overcomes this barrier and has a personally touching plot alongside its stunning visuals and impressive acting. It's not the best film ever, but it is certainly deserved of the trademark James Cameron hype.",

      "text": "James Cameron has made some of the biggest movies to ever hit the big screen, from Aliens to Titanic, and he's notorious for breaking box office records every time he releases a movie. Avatar is no exception. Here's the important question though: Are his movies any good? In some cases, yes - Terminator 2 is still one of my favorite actions movies, and Aliens was a more-than-worthy successor to Ridley Scott's infamous Alien. But in other cases, as with Avatar, he needs to sit down and really consider if he has any purpose on this earth, or if he should just kill himself so we can remember him as a good director with a  few blemishes. Needless to say, I didn't like Avatar. I can't imagine why anyone would; not one thing about the story is original or even clever. I understand that it's pretty and the stupid pink plants stick out in 3-D, but aside from good effects, this movie has absolutely nothing going for it. It has a horribly un-original story, terrible pacing, poor character development, and is just all around a huge waste of time. An example of what I'm talking about would be Trudy Chacon, remember her? No? Neither did I; I had to look her up just now to make sure I got the name right. She's the pilot that is supposedly a primary character. Well, she dies during the battle, and there are a few things wrong with this segment. One, why the **** is her helicopter painted with war paint - let alone the fact that she's wearing it, too, for no reason - but you're going to tell me that they all banded together after their most sacred tree was destroyed to paint this chicks helicopter? Two, why am I supposed to care that a character with absolutely no development dies? Not only could I not remember her name, but I couldn't tell you if she even had any dialogue aside from her tragically terrible final words. I could pick this movie apart scene by scene, but I don't want to implode from anger, and I don't want to bore you, so I'll end it here.

You are transported to a completely believable alien world - you can almost feel Pandora's air on your face. The environmental message, while not by any means new, is presented convincingly, and with aplomb. Sam Worthington also proves himself as a credible leading man.

Also, why is this Sam Worthington guy in so many movies? Why does James Cameron keep casting him? I mean come on, Teller would have been a more reasonable choice than that stooge. Still, the movie has eye-popping FX and the 3D is the best I've ever seen, so it's still probably worth your time if you enjoy other films by Cameron. The mythology is fairly deep, if not cliched, as well so Cameron is technically able to write a story a four year old couldn't. This would all be fine for a animated series, but spending all that money on FX for something like this probably isn't worth. Well, they made an ungodly amount of cashola on this movie, so I guess it was worth it. Then everybody talks about how great this movie is, and The Hurt Locker loses at the Golden Globes.
