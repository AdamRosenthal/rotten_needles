I was expecting a romantic/erotic horror film that can be well made especially with vampires unfortunately we get a forced romance mixed with decent, but standard vampire kills. D",

      "text": "\u201cKiss Of The Damned\u201d carries us back to the golden age of vampire tales when we held a romantic and dark desire for the creature of the night. This film is what I would imagine reading one of those supernatural themed Harlequin-eque romance novels would be like. The director explored the more passionate side of daily life and love affair between a vulnerable but strong woman and a man desperate to love her in every way. It was down right gothic and sweet. The film didn\u2019t bother getting too graphic or soft-core with the heightened sexuality of the relationships depicted in the movie but it was adult enough to be sheer supernatural eye candy. This movie is a great date movie for that vampire loving partner or person you want to kick it with. The story was compelling in true dramatic style that expresses the lives we expect vampires to enjoy. Just note that this is not a \u201chorror\u201d movie nor do I believe the director ever intended it to be one.",
