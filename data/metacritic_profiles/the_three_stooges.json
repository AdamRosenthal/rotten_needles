TheF  Bros. caught the essenese of the stories and jokes. Much research must have gone into  it. (tough job, huh?) While the jokes are good, you have to enjoy slapstick humor.

I recently just returned from the middle east where I was sent when I joined the M.C.  When I returned I was delighted to hear about a tribute being made of the stooges by the Farrelly brothers. I went and saw the movie with my fiancee, who is also and avid stooge fan, and 30 minutes into the movie we left. Why? This series of short tributes was a travesty to say the least. I have been shot and hit by pieces of shrapnel and didn't shed a tear. This tragic farce of a film actually made me so angry that I cried knowing that the real stooges would never have written such a despicable film and that people would actually have the to allow this trash to even go to script. In closing this film is the next worst thing next to the extermination of the Jewish people during the holocaust and if Peter and Bobby  Farrelly had any sense they would erase any idea of making more of these short films. They are an insult to stooge fans everywhere.",

Though the \"Big-3\" (Hayes, Sasso, and Diamantopoulos) turn in first rate impersonations, carrying out the same aching eye-pokes, excruciating hair pulls, bone-crushing skull slaps, and nasty knuckle sandwiches, not to mention the familiar dissonant squabbling and airy mindlessness, they don't even bother to deviate from just that: impersonations; the characters have no intention to extend themselves beyond a 'Mad-TV'-esque imitation-comedy-skit--offering little else than ephemerally visible-but-not-felt- smiles, followed by long-lasting regret and discontent. And, adding to the feeling are cheap laughs, underdeveloped cameo appearances from modern \"characters\" ('Jersey Shore' cast members among them), cheap and flatly-shot scenes, desultorily unapt classic-rock scores, as well as reproachably classless, and dismal attempts to appeal to contemporary audiences--breast and bathroom jokes with references to drug use--all of which disceptively slide past the approbated PG-rating. Did the fillmmakers fail to realize their forbear was clean? Ultimately, the Farrelly brothers, regardless of their own inspirations, don't create anything inspiring--they create a travesty--and participate in an exercise of fully-fledged defaming. It's \"Soitenly\" despicable.",

There are times that it is curious trio's encounter with technology and the modern era, and the excuse that always lived in the orphanage, away from the city, could be a great distraction from their uncertainty. Details are somewhat inconsistent in his script, but the comedy moves so that the audience laughter could distract from the small details of continuity. But I can assure you it is entertaining at many times, and may also find curious references to memorable films. The use of Jersey Shore in the film could be seen as a strange encounter between two generations as the youth group appears as a funny oopart for the old audience.",

And I remember how excited I was at the thought of a film, and I remember falling over laughing when I saw the trailer. Then I saw the film...and it wasn't nearly as funny. While it does stay true to the show and feature some really great performances, it unfortunately stales out too quickly and proves that slapstick doesn't help a 92-minute film achieve comic greatness. Though HARDCORE fans of the show may find something to enjoy here, I really can't recommend seeing the film unless it's \"Bad Movie Night.\" You can do far worse, but you can also do WAY better than \"The Three Stooges.\"",

The next one is the characters, the characters was nothing  like the old show. And the last issue is the acting, the acting was very week and awful.",
