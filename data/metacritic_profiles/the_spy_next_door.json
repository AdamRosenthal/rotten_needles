It's like raping the master of kung-fu for putting as a spy and making fun of him with lousing slapsticks. The scenes are too cheap for the visual effects and a waste of the script,the characters are annoying,too many plot points,the jokes are not that funny,and very insulting for putting Jackie Chan in it. Come on people,it's Jackie Chan,the greatest martial arts master who fights and leaps on the poles,and making him downsize for his acting and hurting him so purpose. Even why George Lopez plays as a villain for taking over the world? He really needs to fire his agent! And why they put a teenager girl who finds this older boy so attractive and the older boy fights Jackie Chan? I don't why they make this movie so bad and please the fans will probably like it,but come one what bad movie for putting Jackie Chan on it and it's not entertaining family film for the kids!",

Well Billy Ray Cyrus is in it.......I could end the review just with that. There are way more problems than that though. Bland and obvious story, jokes that could be seen from miles away and appealing to it's key demographic so desperately it makes the Oogieloves look subtle. If you value your brain cells, make like a spy and stealthily, quickly get the hell away from this movie!",
