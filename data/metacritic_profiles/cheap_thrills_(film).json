I saw good reviews from critics, which was reassuring, but the premise seemed too trashy to be anything more than shock value meaningless entertainment. I was partly right. Cheap Thrills is trashy and shocking. But what I was wrong about was just how trashy and shocking it was going to get. This, weirdly enough, most reminds me of Big Bad Wolves, an Iranian film that was equally graphic and arresting, though, I'm gonna be honest, I think that, while Cheap Thrills is less artistically worthwhile, it is the better film. This movie is so entertaining and FUNNY, I found myself quite pleasantly (and unpleasantly) surprised. The entire concept is ridiculous and some of the extremes are a bit too absurd to be feasible, but the film isn't asking to be taken seriously, which makes it simultaneously succeed, yet also not amount to much more than a genre picture (but what a picture it is). Pat Healy is fantastic and remarkably expressive compared to the other roles I'd seen him in, like The Innkeepers (also starring Sara Paxton) and Compliance. Ethan Embry's character isn't handled with quite as much grace, but he certainly manages. MOST IMPORTANTLY, David Koechner is absolutely riveting here. He adds a strange level of depth to a character that would, on paper, simply come across as a one-note sadist. He truly delivers his finest performance of his career in this movie. I'm being straight up. Check out Cheap Thrills. I recommend it entirely, especially for fans of the low-budget showmanship of Joe Swanberg, Ti West, and Adam Wingard.",
