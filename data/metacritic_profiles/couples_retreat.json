The story is really stupid and full of plot holes, no one wanted to go, but Vaughn gets roped into it and they all go? Everyone's getting divorced, than they dance and are in love, than they argue and are getting divorced, enough is enough! This movie sucked!

It's inevitable, cliched and boring but I kinda had fun watching this movie I find it comforting and relaxing, also the characters are like able the chemistry that the actors have with one another is good. Dave (Vince Vaughn who also wrote the script) and Ronnie (Malin Akerman), Jason (Jason Bateman) and Cynthia (Kirsten Bell) and Joey (Jon Favreau who also wrote the script) and Lucy (Kirstin Davis) including Shane (Faizon Love) and his young girlfriend Trudy (Kali Hawk). The group use to include Shane and Jennifer but their divorced she's gone. Jason and Cynthia's marriage is in trouble, their deciding whether they want to get divorced or not as they explain in their Powerpoint presentation as they explain to their friends. The only reason they wanted their friends to go was because an order to come with them an order to get the \"group rate\" package, the only one they can afford. So the friends go on the trip, and they learn many things about each other that they didn't know before like Dave and Ronnie think their marriage is \"something to work through.\" Joey and Lucy can't even stand looking at each other, so Joey thinks about cheating on her. Shane and Trudy are having trouble relating to each other to their age difference. What really bugs me about this movie is the script is written by Favreau and Vaughn also Dana Fox, two actors who are funny and talented yet this movie isn't all that funny I don't know what was happening when they were writing that script. But overall I enjoyed this movie despite it's lazy, cliched, but the dialogue that the two comedic star write is humorous and entertaining. 3.5 out of 5 stars",
