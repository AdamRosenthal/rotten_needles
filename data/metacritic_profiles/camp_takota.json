Entirely set in Guantanamo, the U.S. prison in Cuba, the story revolves around the unusual relationship between Cole, a rookie guard played by Kristen Stewart, and Ali, a suspected terrorist played by A Separation\u2019s star Payman Maadi. Cold and indifferent, Cole doesn\u2019t immediately get on well with Ali, who bothers her from the very beginning. Their quarrel over the presence of a Harry Potter book in the prison\u2019s library is an original (although quite lenghty) device to introduce the two characters and set the premises for their relationship; it is also one of the few striking sequences in the film. Despite Sattler\u2019s meticulous and researched approach to creating a plausible and realistic prison, Guantanamo is nothing but a setting for the conflict between the two main characters.",
