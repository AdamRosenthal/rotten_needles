Some truly poignant moments are interspersed with a delightful humour and, though some of the themic content needed more care, this is another unique exploration of the nature of humanity and the soul dealt with in a playful, rather than sombre, fashion. The dialogue was occasionally weak, bordering on charicature, and the cinematography was generally well executed.

I thought there were some pretty good performances in here. Dev Patel is pretty good and its pretty hard to criticise Hugh Jackman either, its a nice change to see him as the villain. Still Sigourney Weaver was very underused and Ninja the South African rapper hogged a lot of the screen time acting like an idiot and trying to promote his band Die Antwood. I found Ninja incredibly annoying at points and I hope we don't see him again in any major role. Other than that I enjoyed the action that Chappie had to offer and I think that if you are a fan of Blomkamp's other films you will likely enjoy this one.",

Blomkamp's signature blend of raw violence and human sentiment is still on display throughout, but is more potent here since the director (and his wife Terri Tatchell) focus purely on the struggle between children and adults, and the hardships that come with growing up.

Giving  rappers Die Antwoord (Ninja and Yo-Landi) major roles was a big risk that mostly paid off in the final scenes (and reinforced the distinctly South African feel of the movie). My advice?

But here's the thing that personally got me and that's the ending, it wasn't terrible but int the whole build up of Chappie essentially dying and with this looming death overhead he tries to find other means to try and live even breaking his promise with Dion saying he will do no crime so there's the loss of innocence as he ignores Dion and get's tempted by everyone else to do commit crime, and in the end it should of been a confrontation with him and Dion (his maker) who is kinda portraying god who at the end of the movie is dying from a fight but Chappie believes he can save him by transferring his consciousness into another robot essentially letting him live forever, but this is successful and Chappie does come to terms with his death happy to sacrifice himself so that his maker is alive and well but Dion then say he can save Chappie too and this is successful. I am saying that a sadder ending would of been miles better in delivering a message about humanity and all but in the end the overall movie is visually stunning with his robotics and does provide a look on someone growing up and facing hardships making him stronger for it (even though the movie is being held within the spam of a week). I was actually sort of thinking the story would of been different like the police were abusing their power and a guy who made the robots get's another point of view and decides to help by trying to create a robot that will help rise against the oppressors and this goes with the theme of Chappie growing up and is being pulled by two sides as both argue a somewhat valid point like one guy suggest going against the robots and that'll take the power for the corrupted another suggest go for the head of the snake and kill the corrupted so they can instead have the power.",

This was like a modern day Yellow Submarine with more movie than music and Die Antwoord doesn't suck at acting like the Beatles did. Ninja and Yolandi were actually very solid actors for this being their first film. The rest of the cast crushed it because they're all incredibly talented especially Patel. I hear a lot about Jackman's two dimensional villain and how bad it was, but that's what kind of movie this is. It's a serious movie that never takes itself too seriously. I swear to Science that film critics these days are so far up their own a***s that they wouldn't know a good movie if it puked in their face. Chappie is a solid flick and deserves praise.

Neill Blomkamp has created a unique film, however critics seem to only be looking at it as copying other movies with robots in them. Chappie tackles issues about family and nature vs nurture. He has a creator looking out for him and hoping to nourish his mind with art and poetry while the people with custody over him influence him negatively leading to gangster activities. Another common complaint is that Ninja and Yolandi were horrible actors. I disagree Yolandi had me genuinely interested. She is a very unique person and had a motherly side that I grew to love. Ninja also achieved the his characters point. He abused his son and forced him to conform to his style of life and do what he wanted, rather than allow his son to become who he wanted to be. Another issue that was tackled in this film was spirituality and consciousness. How do we define consciousness? Blomkamp creates a robot that can think. i immediately fell in love with Chappie. His mannerism and outlook on life was extremely interesting to watch. I was emotionally distraught in scenes were Chappie was beaten or mistreated in anyway. This kind of emotional response is what a good movie can create. I understand that the ending may not be for everyone but the way that a Blompkamp takes two characters and ultimately they are one in the same. I actually felt like the robot Chappie was another human inside the shell of a robot and I think that is what Blompkamp was really trying to get across. I believe that this film's major flaw was that it was marketed in two different ways. One was a movie focused on violence and the \"oppressive police force\" as some descriptions call it, however never once in the film are the Scouts in anyway oppressive. They are simply doing their police work effectively. Another way the movie was marketed was a way that seemed to be trying to appeal to families. I believe some people thought the movie would be something that children would enjoy and then when they found out about the R rating they dropped interested. Among all of the criticism I think people should stop listening to others and see Chappie for themselves and experience a truly entertaining experience.",

Chappie must sort through these views and face his own mortality just like any person would, without the over the top action of Transcendence or the muddled physics of time travel from Terminator.  I have not only seen these themes examined, sometimes badly, in other pieces of art, but these are themes that real scientists and engineers are exploring with current technology, such as emotional bonding with robots based on vocal and facial cues.  I eat this stuff up, and I hope that at the very least it will make everyone think about these themes in a meaningful way.  I think much of the negativity toward this film is based on either not understanding the field of artificial intelligence or not identifying with what could be considered a \"good\" character, but I urge that even if you do not view robots as \"human\" that you at least consider all sides of the discussion critically.",

Like a brochure to sway our thinking it's a niche study ongoing. It's not black hole theory but plays on our emotions like some cheap trick.

But it looks good and a watchable piece of  fine art. Director/co-writer  Neil Blomkamp and other writer Terri Tatchell, keep trying to focus on three or four stories, to make a film but an order to make good-looking film you have to focus on one story. Not even the actors Hugh Jackman, Sigourney Weaver, and Dev Patel can save this film from a script were we have Chappie. Die antwoord the band stars as the lead characters as gangsters, it's confusing on how they star in it  but they don't play them selves? their music is bad and we don't buy their acting. Sharlto Copley's motion capture performance is astonishing and that's what sold the movie \"priceless,\" this could of been an A movie but it's a B+ movie. Since Blomkamp (\"District 9 and \"Elysium\"), is taking over the \"Alien 5\" franchise i think we should worry? or  i could not have been more concerned? will he make his A.I robots fight with the aliens? confusing.

His role as a paranoid ex-military man was flawless. Niell shows a future South African drug gang society that is as much captivating as it is frightening while somehow dispelling needless violence. Even with an R rating for language and violence, none of it is misplaced. Character development was done well also, giving not just \"enough of\" an arc for every main character but instead completing their story in a fulfilling way. My only complaint has to do with the \"gangster\" sideways shooting method that Watkin Jones teaches Chappie in one scene. However I do not want to oversell the movie either.

In the past 24 hours I ave watched American Sniper and Chappie in theaters. I didn't want to watch American Sniper because I assumed it was a movie made for rednecks, but after the slow beginning it was amazing and had me in tears, but that's for another review. My expectations for Chappie were not high. I listen to Die Antwoord and I was prepared to cringe at their acting and the overused plot. In brief, the movie was stupid and neat. Stupid neat. I enjoyed it. The target audience for this film are R&B; lovers, gangsters by heart, nerds, cultured people that can put oddness aside, and people with an interest in technology. I can understand the mixed reviews because not a lot of people fit into these categories, and I would not recommend the film to these people. I fell under the near market, and the previous exposure to Die Antwoord market. This film is not going to win most original, best picture, or acting but as for a movie to go watch with a friend on a Saturday night, I give it an B+ or an A-. It exercised the mind and your inner gangster. After the movie I had pulled up Die Antwoord on Spotifiy and drove to their South African R&B; beats and it was fun. There were plenty of cliches that are associated with this type of film, but among the recylced plot was its own touch of creativity. Their were vivid colors, not too much focus on stupid violence, and things that you won't see in any other AI film. There were plenty of silly plot wholes that act as conversation starters after the film, such as security protocol. So I would call this a social film. Go watch it with a friend that fits the markets.",

      "text": "After the disappointment of 'Elysium', 'Chappie' at the very least marks somewhat of a return towards the successful style of 'District 9'  even though it falls very short to Blomkamp's stellar debut. The thing about 'Chappie' is that it is a film of great moments and depth but riddled with some bizarre choices in the storytelling that serves to undo all the great work that Blomkamp manages to achieve. The character of 'Chappie' himself is a technical triumph and just oozes life and feels natural within the landscape whilst also providing the film with its main source of charm and comedy. But the most glaringinly odd choice that Blomkamp makes with this is having the main character supported by 3 unlikeable criminals who then act as the main focus of the narrative instead of the more obvious character Deon (Dev Patel). It's such a strange choice especially since initially there appears to be nothing redeemable about them and intially it doesn't work at all. However by the films climax, you do kind of feel a connection to them and their relationship with Chappie somehow seems to 'redeem' them by the time all hell breaks loose without you even realising it. It's all rather odd and just screams out as a bad idea and yet somehow it does work even though I would say that Chappie's relationship with Deon feels rather forced in comparison and doesn't really need to be there. The action is better, the characters are more interesting in spite of the issues I mentioned but I do feel that too much is going on at different times and I feel that the balance isn't quite there. It's definitely not a disaster by any means and while I look forward to Blomkamp's upcoming Alien film, 'Chappie' is a fair indicator that Blomkamp isn't quite the one hit wonder some might have feared.",

Visually the film is excellent, where it falls down is in the script, storytelling and the acting. Plot holes abound, the security company at the heart of the story looks more like Wrexham Hogg from The Office, with security measures to match, and the acting of punk pair Die Antwood (in two lead roles) is truly appalling.

I have no idea why the critics hated it so much. No, it is not as good as District 9, but it is still a good action science fiction movie from a guy, Neill Blomkamp, who seems to be quite adept at making socially conscious action movies. But heck, don't listen to me, I liked Elysium too. To me, Blomkamp is a very good director who is very ambitious in his films. They do not match his ambitions more often than not, but the end result is also quite positive. The themes here are similar to the rest of his films and Johannesburg will certainly continue to be viewed negatively worldwide due to its portrayal here, but all the same, it is a very fun and well made film. The cast as a whole is good and quite believable in all of their roles. I know Die Antwoord got a lot of criticism for their performances, but I truly believed them and they did not stick out at all. The development of Chappie was great and he is certainly one of the best characters in a film in recent times, in my humble opinion. The film really delivers in the heady sci-fi elements viewers come to expect from the genre (as well as a ton of Biblical elements, such as \"genisis\" and referring to the guy who created Chappie as his \"maker\", plus some characters being obviously religious). The action is well done and the film can be quite adorable (thanks to Chappie) and funny throughout. It is also oddly touching, as it always amazes me how much I can be made to care about a robot. Overall, Chappie does have flaws, namely in the way of plotholes or points where it feels like the story just skipped ahead a bit. It also manages to cram a lot into a short time period, which is a unique criticism, but one I feel is justified. All the same, Blomkamp's films always are very sleek and stylish and the way the robots are designed is super cool (just as the aliens in District 9's design was great). As a whole, Chappie was unfairly torn apart for some of its flaws, while many ignored the many positives it delivered. Not as good as District 9, but Blomkamp certainly took a step back in that direction here, as it is better than Elysium. Definitely looking forward to his Alien film (hopefully set in Joburg, because why not).",

No, it\u00b4s not sensational and no, it doesn\u00b4t feel as innovative as it could have been if released years ago, because now we have seen this kind of stuff many times. But it still is an interesting take on humanity, machines and how the world works. Not so engaging in its first act, the viewer ends empathizing with the characters and especially with Chappie. The final part is unexpectedly moving and it has a nice and different outcome. Very enjoyable film too harshly judged by some.",

Instead of becoming this sweet and lovable robot, he becomes an a****** and a gangster and completely ignore's Deon (Dev Patel) while committing various crimes. But, the movie does do a great job of how showing how a child's mind is so easily influenced. However, there are some major issues with this movie. First of all, the actors who played the gangsters who raise Chappie (voiced by Sharlto Copley) are completely terrible at acting. I mean, like Razzie worthy. None of the lines they say have any emotional depth and they can be extremely over-the-top and annoying as hell. The other big issue is the pacing, which is a complete mess. Some parts feel slow and some parts feel fast-paced. But all-in-all, Chappie is a good and thought provoking science-ficton film that conveys how the mind of a child can be so easily bended. 7/10",

I am certainly not a fan of Die Antwoord, but I feel like their portrayal of the slightly dim-witted, but seasoned Johannesburg gangsters in the near future, was pretty spot on.

Chappie just shows a kid learning things from the real world and adapting it (but instead of a kid, a robot) also there were fewer action parts than I expected, because the reason of seeing the movie was that, however it does a decent job on those few parts.
