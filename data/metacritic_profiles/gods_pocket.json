Some great visuals and epic scenes, one of my favourites beeing Ra's fight upon the sun barque against the god of darkness and chaos Apophis! I could imagine that the CGI could maybe look a bit unrealistic or cheesy on a normal screen, but seeing it in 3D on the big screen it actually looked rather convincing and cool. And it's not easy to display gods and their epic fights in a way that does them justice without getting too over the top. Gerard Butler is allways fun to watch, and the others are doing ok. Some lines are cheesy, but overall the characters are likeable. Script and story are ok too. I liked the way they portraied the gods. Wielding terrible power, but not almighty, and rather human like in character. More entertaining and closer to the mythological source material than other movies like Clash of the Titans, or Thor. And yes they cast white actors (among others) to play egyptian gods which is not ideal, but understandable. If europeans can deal with a black Heimdal in Thor (you know, the god that is literally called \"the whitest of the Aesir\" and \"the white As\" in the source mythology), egyptians should be able to handle a white Horus. Hey at least Toth was black and Anubis was a Jackal. What more do you want? ;)",

On the day of Horus' (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau) coronation, his malevolent uncle Set (Gerard Butler) murders reigning king Osiris (Bryan Brown), steals the crown, and rips Horus' eyes from his head before exiling him.  Set's tyrannical rule is later challenged by a jaded, reluctant Horus and a mortal thief (Brenton Thwaites) who retrieves one of the fallen god's baby blues.  The thief's aim is to save his recently murdered girlfriend (astonishing beauty and Fury Road wife Courtney Eaton) from the afterlife.  It is a shame director Alex Proyas' career is not in a healthier place two decades after the extremely promising one-two of The Crow and Dark City, but he remains a bold stylist.  Every frame of this two-hour-plus film is a punishing and sumptuous blast to the face.  The gold-hued, overwrought imagery\u201475 percent sword-and-sandal fantasy, 20 percent science fiction, 5 percent acid trip\u2014includes a bejeweled Ra (Geoffrey Rush) battling a writhing rectal demon in space, she-assassins atop serpentine steeds, and decidedly Danish and Scottish Egyptian deities transforming into glowing ten-foot iron men.  Even tiny details are hideous and wonderful:  consider Osiris' inexplicable soul patch.  The cumulative experience is numbing and beyond over-the-top, but there are several moments of true beauty and aesthetic fascination, for better or worse.  And the dialogue is execrable, particularly the modern quips, and a certain secondhand shame is felt for the mostly talented and very attractive cast.  A disaster?  Maybe.

      "text": "Alex Proyas' Gods of Egypt is a truly incredible creation that can only be properly described as: what? Telling the story of the gods of Egypt and a struggle for the role of King of all Egypt, this film is truly a sight to behold. Really, the amount that goes on in these two hours is hard to put to words. That said, I am going to try. In the film, Set (Gerard Butler) is the god of Darkness, while his brother, Osiris (Bryan Brown), is King. As Osiris is set to pass the role of King to his son, Horus (Nikolaj Coster-Waldau), Set is unhappy. Thus, he kills Osiris, blinds Horus, and takes the crown. Set then proceeds to kill all gods against him and enslave the population of Egypt, while also attacking his father, Ra (Geoffrey Rush). By attacking Ra, he allows a demon that Ra fights nightly to attack the world with the intention of having this demon consume the afterlife. This would then give Set immortality and the power that would come with this. Meanwhile, Horus is distraught and blind, hiding in seclusion. That is until he meets Bek (Brenton Thwaites). A thief, Bek was enslaved by Set, along with his love Zaya (Courtney Eaton). When he tries to help Zaya escape, she is killed by Set's builder. In an attempt to rescue her from the afterlife, Bek strikes a deal with Horus to help him steal back his eyes (Bek had already stolen one back) in return for granting life back to Zaya. However, unbeknownst to Bek, Horus does not have the power to give life. Only Ra has that ability. Even worse, Set has made it so that to enter the afterlife, one must have riches. Zaya has none, meaning that she will be destroyed. Fortunately, Horus' love and the goddess of love, Hathor (Elodie Yung), is in a position to help. After recognizing the love Bek has for Zaya, she sacrifices herself by taking off a bracelet. This bracelet, given to her by Horus, had protected her from the demons that wished to consume her soul. By giving it to Bek to give to Zaya, Hathor feels as though she fulfilled her purpose as a god. Funnily enough, Zaya never needed it because that demon Set unleashed on the afterlife began consuming the afterlife right when it was her turn to relinquish her riches. Now, however, Bek and Horus must fight back against the world. Here, Horus learns that his journey was to fight for humanity and serve the world, rather than himself and other gods. In defeating Set, he teams up with Bek to save Egypt and restore order to the world. They also steal back Ra's sword - which Set had taken - to give Ra back his power. Once his sword is back in his hand, Ra is able to kill the demon. Moved by Horus' actions, Ra offers his services to his grandson. To repay Bek - who was killed by Set at this point - Horus asks Ra to give Bek and Zaya back their life so that they may be together once more. Ra grants this and Horus is made the King of Egypt while Bek and Zaya get to live happily ever after. Phew.",

The film did provide a spectacle, however, with a number of interesting characters and interesting moments throughout. The plot makes little sense and the whitewashing element so heavily discussed is greatly prominent within the film, and many parts of the film come off a cheesy or unattempted humor. The film was interesting overall, and for those looking for a fun movie for the family or friends to watch would probably enjoy it, though looking past the great effects and colorful characters, one would come to find out this is only just an OK Movie.",
