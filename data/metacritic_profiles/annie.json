Unfortunately, the movie stinks. Cameron Diaz. Why is that blonde bimbo in this movie, anyway? She did her worse in Sex Tape, now this. In the original, Hannigan is one of the greatest villains of all time where she was a drunken caretaker and punish many orphanage girls like doing chores, scrubbing the bathroom, and allowing her butler, Rooster, to kill Annie. Dude, Carol Burnett was in the original. A true legendary classic. This is what musical movies is all about. But this Hannigan by Diaz, just complete rubbish. If any movie that should be in the worst movies of 2014 is Annie.

But this one has a beautiful new touch for a new generation of families.  As a professional musician, I appreciate the arrangements of the the classic songs. They were not overdone, but the sounds and transitions were updated to sound modern. The new Annie is even cuter than the first and Jamie does an outstanding job playing cold and jaded businessman. The storyline is excellent by itself and would deserve at least a 3 stars without anything else but I do believe it was not only done well but took you on an emotional journey. I cannot believe that people are giving this movie low ratings.  And to say that Wallis wasn't good?... or sickeningly cute... that sounds crazy or simply like a \"hater\".  I hate saying this, but it makes me ask the question, is it just because this is a black Annie? Truly, to not like this movie I question how much of a heart one could have. I would say its un-american to not like a movie that so portrays the pursuit of happiness that resounds through our American spirit.",

But when you make a movie you need to show that, a movie, not a musical even thought it was based on the original musical, the central theme of the story disappears when you are watching it and being interrupted by a random moment when a starring role is singing. I admit that the soundtrack is good and renovated, but the soundtrack it's the soundtrack, you can't put the whole thing in a movie and lose the story that way.
