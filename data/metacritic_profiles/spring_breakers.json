I don't think it's fair to give this movie a score lower than 3, just because it was quite interesting. However, this movie did have very terrible moments. I'd give James Franco's performance a 4/10. He was mostly convincing, but was playing a terrible character. I'm not bashing his acting, I'm just surprised that he degraded himself to such a stupid character. Too many unneeded raunchy scenes and other party scenes that were repeated through the whole movie really made the movie worse. There is no connection to any character whatsoever. The ending is mixed. While it was too unrealistic, abrupt and should have explained more, the out-of-the-blue effect it has makes it interesting.

Far from hijacking trucks, the caper that Angie proposes is a \"steak-out\", described by the brunette as follows: you order the meat, you eat half, and then you bring the other half back to the $22/a night motel room that they share with two other girls. Thoroughly modern Merritt, despite being the class spokesperson for \"playing house before marriage\", antagonizing her professor in the process after a lecture on \"random dating among college freshmen\", is in actuality, a virgin, but the blond is progressive, therefore corruptible, so the girl goes \"wild\", allowing herself to be Angie's partner-in-crime. At a local hangout, we see the Italian on her latest job(with Merritt in-tow), masquerading as paying customers, in which the broke girls nurse complimentary cups of hot water flavored with contraband teabags, while nibbling on bring-your-own-saltines that they shuttle to and fro below the diner countertop in their attempt to escape detection from the greasy spoon's proprietor. For this, hijinks which seem tame compared to, say, armed robbery and first-degree murder, Merritt half-jokingly tells Angie that her scheme will land them in San Quentin. For its era, they were loose, because good girls, as portrayed in the movies, thought about going steady, not going all the way, or \"backseat bingo\" as Merritt puts it. Whereas Tuggle asks a male hitchhiker, \"How big are your feet?\" Candy, in Spring Breakers, is less coy, holding up a sign for Brit in a darkened lecture hall that reads: I want penis. More than no guilt sex, or to borrow the professor's formal terminology: premature emotional involvement on a first date, what Brit and her friends really lust after is money. No cutting corners for these toxic princesses; this is a new breed of \"kids\". To procure a bankroll for their booze-and-drug fueled vacation, they rob a chicken shack, intimidating the customers with squirt guns, hammers, and 'tude. Safe to say, when Brit, sensing apprehension from her partners concerning their felonious plot, tells them to \"act like you're in a movie,\" that movie isn't Where the Boys Are. Although the girls are no angels; they drink and smoke(Tuggle shows a fake I.D. to the barkeep, while Merritt and Melanie puff on cigarettes), and have sex(Melanie has multiple partners, the last one ending in date rape), their debauchery is no match for all the bong hits and alcohol that find passage through the half-naked bodies of these libertine sociopaths. Quite pointedly, the girls in Where the Boys Are dig jazz, dialectic jazz, played by white musicians, akin to Spring Breakers, where Alien, a rapper/drug kingpin, plays hip hop to the sunburnt party people; a white rapper, whose antecedent, Basil, the white leader of a bebop trio, are homologous entities in their appropriation of what is considered to be a black music form. Given the seamless diversity among Larry Clark's Kids, the fluidity in which the contravening cultural group manipulates the expropriated genre on the beachfront stage would seem to be an intentional ploy on the filmmaker's part, since the diegetic music performed by the co-opting musicians in Spring Breakers, accentuates the unexpressed but readily apparent segregation laws that keeps the Ft. Lauderdale of Where the Boys Are uniform with one single skin color. At the outset of the 1960 film, the university campus that the girls attend is inundated with snow, and more importantly, a strong gust; an unintentional, but nevertheless, pointed metaphor about a change in the wind that would beget the Civil Rights Movement. Faced with a remodeling of the social stratum, the girls, conspicuously, head south. Back at the aforementioned diner, a male patron seated next to Merritt, spreads ketchup over a slice of white bread. Contextually speaking, the innocuous act now reads as her indifference to shed blood, the fallout from racial strife. Although Brit and Candy gun down numerous young black men at Alien's arch-rival's compound, their skin color, arguably, is a matter of sheer happenstance. They're post-colonial. The victims could easily have been white. Granted, at a seminar, the BFFs ignore a murder scene photograph of Emmitt Till, the 14-year-old boy whose death spearheaded an activism for social change. And yet, the same girls seem at ease with Alien's crowd, primarily black, at a run-down pool hall. It's Faith, the innocent and sheltered one, cut more from the same cloth as Merritt and her pals, who feels anxious and uneasy in mixed company. Faith is a proxy, a throwback, the good girl interested only in where the white boys are.",

Intense, sure, but useful? Not at all. That is how Spring Breakers is defined for me, really. A bunch of scenes and situations that were dragged out for far too long. For me, this one felt like a horrible music video that was an hour and a half long rather than just 3-5 minutes long. Hell, even if this one was just a music video, I would still hate it.",

      "text": "Spring break is getting to be like prom night or Thanksgiving: an alien American institution we've consumed so much in pop culture that it's almost as if we Brits have experienced it in our rainy Brit lives. Anyway, we're expected to be in on the cultural reference  in this case, lithe, young college kids partying super hard in sunny Florida during the March vacation. The Glasgow comic Kevin Bridges famously took a stand against this Americanisation, dourly recalling watching high school movies with \"spring break\" scenes: \"We didn't have 'spring break'; we had the Easter holidays.\" Like a Christmas movie in December, this film has actually been released at the correct seasonal time, although it means less in the shivering UK than in the US. James Franco's creepy gangsta character in this film is always intoning the words: \"Spring Breeeeaaak  in a state of bleary ecstasy, as if invoking, or desecrating, a quasi-religious icon.Harmony Korine has given us a violent pulp true romance that could be renamed A Pre-Summer's Night's Wet Dream. Like the exploitation films by Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez, it's the kind of movie that looks as if it was created to fit the poster. The difference is that those films signalled that they were faux-trash. This is more like the real thing. Spring Breakers is Korine's most technically competent and fluent movie; probably his most commercial, his funniest, perhaps even his least irritating. The plot concerns college students who are bored with their course and their lives: they zone out and pass rude notes to each other during lectures on African-American experiences in the postwar US; this academic subject is a deadpan touch of insolence on Korine's part, considering the overtly racial aspect of what is finally to happen. These badass girls are Brit (Ashley Benson), Candy (Vanessa Hudgens) and Cotty, played by the director's wife, Rachel Korine. From their kindergarten days, they are friendly with Faith (Selena Gomez), a modest Christian girl. Our heroines are desperate to go on spring break, but have no money  so with daring, masks and a fake gun, they knock over a fast-food restaurant and gloatingly exult in their cash (\"It makes my  look bigger!\"). Taking Faith with them, they head for party central in the Sunshine State, falling there under the dangerous spell of the drug dealer, rapper and automatic-weapons-enthusiast Alien. He is played with tattoos, metal teeth and cornrows by Franco. Alien conceives a kind of passion for these women, like a non-pimp pimp who doesn't intend them to have sex with anyone but him. All too clearly, Korine is ventriloquising himself with this character. He creates four lissome heroines who appear in their bikinis pretty much all the time. Even in court. After a while, you have to wonder where the heck they are keeping their hotel-room keys, cash and phones etc. Korine became notorious with the script he wrote for Larry Clark's Kids in the 1990s and now, at 40, he has achieved  well, not maturity exactly, but a kind of seniority, bordering on the maestro-perviness of the great Clark himself. Like that other spring-break classic, Piranha 3D, Spring Breakers is naturally an excuse to show lots of semi-naked women and men  but mostly women  with in-your-face/in-their-swimsuit-area shots. Alien is always gasping at how pretty his foursome are: giggling, they pose for the imaginary photo he frames with his fingers  and yet all the women and indeed men on camera are pretty. Korine is giving us a preselected, pre-auditioned representation of youth and beauty. For all its absurdity and voyeurism, Korine brings to it a real authorial style. He shapes the pulp. He leches over the women, but he is also on their side. It is a world away from his (interesting) experimental piece Trash Humpers, and also, thankfully, from his excruciatingly annoying drama Mister Lonely. The colossal party scenes  in the pool, on the beach, in the hotel room, on the balcony  are coolly choreographed in montage, and the more desolate \"reportage\" shots outside all-night convenience stores look good. There is an undeniable directorial strut in Spring Breakers. Where, precisely, he is strutting to is another question. As for Faith, the good girl, her role is unexpected. Much is made of her attendance in Christian prayer groups, which sometimes convene in front of a huge stained-glass window. Given Faith's background, I wondered if there would be some reference, ironic or otherwise, to Good Friday or Easter Sunday  the events that license the holiday. But no. I suspect the idea never occurred to Harmony Korine for a moment. It is an entirely pagan entertainment.",

In this she got really down and dirty, and some might think its slutty. But there all playing college girls on Spring Break they wont sit around and watch TV they will party there asses off. The pairing of Ashley and Vanessa was a good combo. Rachel the directors wife I believe I think made her acting debut superb. James eh. Just James a good actor came in on his A-Game. Skrillex scored the amazing soundtrack. And when I say amazing I mean it. The film is stylish from pink-blue-neon-glow in the dark everything colorful.

This movie is just another strong signifier in my mind that we are entering a new New Hollywood era. I can't wait to keep having new and exciting experiences at the cinema. No matter what you think about this movie it is definitely a unique experience and something really different than usual Hollywood schlock.",

The cinematography is beautiful, and the film is painted in a flashy surrealism that carries on throughout giving a dreamy feel.

The film is full of unlikeable characters and, along with prison, spring break seems like an activity that most rational people would wish to avoid. The voice over narration from the girls' point of view presents it as a kind of utopia that the accompanying visuals deny. There is no denying the technical package, though. Stylised direction, eye catching cinematography and skillful editing help to ensure that the film looks slick and professional and yes, after abandoning my initial misgivings, the film does become hypnotically compelling. James Franco, in another 'out there' performance, is just great as the rapper/gangster Alien and the music by Cliff Martinez adds a whole other dimension to the proceedings. One of the best scenes has James Franco playing piano and the three remaining girls singing a sweet Britney Spears song whilst inter cuts show the violence they have  perpetrated.

The social commentary is there with the ironic and contradictory voiceover work as well as the continual downward spiral of these four girls when their temptations are maximized and succumbed to and when their love for easy entertainment gets the best of them. The portrayal of the girls was realistic with the voiceovers talking about how \"spiritual\" their break is while showing the girls having sex and doing cocaine, and the shots intercut of Selena Gomez at her church spliced with her smoking pot. The casting was all very good; I loved how Harmony Korine decided to cast innocent-looking girls previously known for their adorable Disney work to show how innocence can be lost so easily.

Granted, either you like it or you don't you have to understand that Korine is in fact an art-house director, and rarely follows conventional film standards. Having said that, for those who've never witnessed films like 'Kids', 'Gummo' and 'Ken Park' expect to see something different.",

There's a lot of voice-over with conversations said in the future while showing something different. Kind of confuses you a little. There are a lot of boobs in this movie. I would say thats a plus but at the same time, it takes away from the gritty realism that the movie seems to try to achieve. Girls don't take their tops off in public and not by the dozens, at least from my experience. There were many porny shots that didn't seem necessary. I know why they were there. Without them I most people would have lost interest in this movie. It lacks depth and character development. 45 minutes into the movie and the I didn't feel like I knew any of the main cast except for Selena Gomez's character.

This movie had potential to  build a very strong storyline, but it was never developed. The only character we personally got to know a little bit was Selena's Gomez's Faith. I would've liked to know more about the other three girls and why they acted they way the did. I enjoy movies where I can feel the characters, this whole movie I was just dizzy because of the mixture of the weird dialogue and camera angles. I did enjoy James Franco's performance and Alien was probably the best performance I have ever seen him portray but there is no way it is Oscar worthy.

The director does a pretty good job of allowing you to know what's going on but the script is a little confusing, although that could have just been me.

The acting from the 5 leads is also very superb with a truly out of the box performance by James Franco. I can see where people can be skeptical of this movie, most will walk into it viewing as something similar to Project X or SuperBad with Selena Gomez trying to shed her good girl Disney image but its not nearly at all like that. Its polarizing but in the end, its also brilliant with Harmony sucking you in with visually enticing cinematography with a oddly hypnotic aura mixed in with a neon fused and techno filled score by Skrillex and Cliff Martinez. It can be said that this film is like scar face meets good, country girl Taylor Swift or Taxi Driver on Heroin and adderal, if you're into potential cult classics with an art house feel and subliminal genius then this movie is for you.",

Even James Franco decides to waste his life playing in this plotless movie. The best part about it is that I'm reviewing this movie in Spring so you can't tell whether I'll see it again or not... but because my score is a negative, it means I don't want to see it again. If you're a critic and you decide to love watching this, you can save your life by getting some eye medicine. How in the world is such a film made in 2013 can be made to be absolutely to look shamefully bad in front of public? Now if we didn't had films like Scary Movie 5 or Grown Ups 2, this would've been the worst film of 2013 I've ever seen.",
