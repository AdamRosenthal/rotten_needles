      "text": "Check his docket and pray for a romantic comedy, a sci-fier, a western, anything, really, even a porno. That's because Matt Dillon has a weakness for armored car heist scripts. Should the former Flamingo Kid make one more of these routine genre movies, he'll have himself a trilogy. Just last year, he played a \"taker\", a guard, in Nimrod Antal's \"Armored\"; this time, he's blue, a good guy who stops the \"Takers\", a detective named Jack Welles. Maybe next time he'll play the truck. Maybe next time Dillon will star in a movie that's worthy of his talent. While \"Armored\" was by no means a brilliant piece of moviemaking, at least the actual robbery was halfway plausible; far-fetched, perhaps, but plausible enough to stave off laughter from the moviegoer. Unlike \"Takers\", where Detective Jack Welles faces criminals who are practically performance artists when it comes to hijacking armored cars. After the bravura bank robbery that opens the film(featuring an escape plan that is flat-out ludicrous), the thieves(featuring Hayden Christensen reimagined as Jason Bourne; a born-again Christensen) up the stakes with an even more daring caper. In broad daylight, the thieves steal the trucks on a busy street during rush hour, where a whole bunch of hypotheticals come into play which would prevent the job from being successfully pulled off. These armed robbers have a David Blaine-mentality when it comes to armed robbery, an exhibitionist streak, as there are just too many people who are watching them steal the loot. Although \"Armored\" had its share of credibility issues(in particular, no GPS system on the truck), \"Takers\" expects the moviegoer to believe that the police wouldn't be able to ferret out a fake road construction crew during the interim leading up to the implosion, and that there's not a cop around during the shootout between the guards and the thieves. When Ghost(T.I.) had explained the job to his \"boyz\", the crew's initial hesitation was due to the expediency of the job, which posed an affront to their professionalism. This would seem downright laughable, since there's nothing professional looking about the set-up. In a good heist pic, the more painstakingly intricate the preparations are, the better. Needless to say, \"Takers\" is no \"Ocean's Eleven\". The group sorely lacks a charismatic ringleader. They need somebody like, say, Matt Dillon. As the straight and arrow detective, Detective Welles, however, isn't going to garner any votes for \"father of the year\"; his impromptu take-your-daughter-to-work day could have gone horribly wrong. When \"Takers\" introduces the detective's daughter, it doesn't spend the time needed to portray Jack as a caring father like how the filmmaker probably had intended. Since \"Takers\" wastes time on an extended foot race between Dillon and a perp(Chris Brown, in an impressive feat of...running), the filmmaker compresses Jack's personal and professional life in one scene without realizing how it makes the detective look. He looks like a jackass.",

      "text": "Although TAKERS can be potentially one-dimensional with it's main cast of characters and clich\u00c3\u00a9d in it's own story, climatic actions scenes and decent acting help bring some some momentum to the table. TAKERS stars a whole list of popular hip-hop artists, a few talented actors, and Hayden Christensen, blends them all into one film in hopes of producing a movie that will attract the modern film audience. While it eventually does just that, other types of individuals may be able to discover it's flaws without much trouble. The buildup in TAKERS is like any typical heist movie. It opens with a bank heist, the robbers make out with the money, and then they decide to perform another heist soon thereafter. The main group of five is approached by an older comrade of theirs named 'Ghost' (T.I.) who was released on probation for good behavior on a sentence from robbery 5 years previously. He suggests the 5 perform a heist differently this time; steal $20 million from a pair of armored vans via 'Italian Job' style. What follows is the usual build-up of the heist and the problems of the people involved, which is the real problem. The term 'forced character buildup' comes in clearly at this point. I really never cared for any of the main central characters due to their single dimensional personalities. While there is the drug stricken sister of Elba and the awkward father-daughter relationship of Dillon, that pair of backstories is really the only ones the audience is presented to throughout the film. In a film so titled 'TAKERS', the audience isn't taken it, persay, by the characters. You really don't get to know them, and its hard to find sympathy when negative things happen to each of them. TAKERS does house some great action scenes at times, and climatic shootouts that kept me suspended on who was going to get out alive. I was also fond of the Chris Brown chase later on in the film, and his broad range of acrobatic skills kept me entertained until it's end. The acting, at least from a few actors, is decent. Dillon is great as always, and Walker and Ealy prove to show that they have decent acting skills. Chris Brown was decent as well as T.I. Hayden Christensen still needs some more time in acting school. Although TAKERS is a clich\u00c3\u00a9d and unoriginal heist film, it's many action scenes held my attention throughout, and the acting from the more veteran actors was a relieve. TAKERS never brings anything new to the table in any means, but it does bring some variety and excitement for the more modern viewers.",

TI could really use some acting lessons (perhaps while he does his second 11 month bid). Idris Elba, Hayden Christensen, and whomever else was in the movie should file this one on their taxes as charity work for the careers of the first two mentioned. Those other actors could have chosen better scripts and I personally suspect they felt sorry for Chris and TI and that is why they took their respective roles. Finally, Idris Elba needs to quit doing these sorry movies (like Obsessed; we know Beyonce can't act but did they have to tie the anchor around Elba's legs on that one?).

Nice plot with some dandy twists and the pace quickens as the movie moves along.  Don't go in expecting a lot, just sit back and enjoy the ride, but hold on tight as by the end of the movie you will feel like you just got off of a runaway train!",
