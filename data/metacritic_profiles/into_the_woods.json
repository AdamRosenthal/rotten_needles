      "text": "This is one of the most captivating and affecting film adaptations of a stage musical I've seen! As a word of caution, do NOT presume that because the plot is based upon \"interwoven fairy tales\" this is intended to be a feel-good kids' movie. Acquaint yourself with the (excellent) 3-hour Sondheim musical and you'll soon realize that the aim of this story is to explore what occurs *beyond* the happy endings. The events of the second half are dark, yes; but the overall message is hopeful (listen to the words of the movie's final two songs). Certain changes and omissions were necessary to get the film version down to a palatable running length, and huge fans of the stage musical may be put off by some of these. Personally, though, I feel that they were appropriate given the totally different demands of each medium. I was blown away by the performances and the amazing vocal talents of the cast as a whole. The actors pulled off those notoriously intricate Sondheim arrangements beautifully -- and there are many moments of humor to lighten the mood. In particular, Chris Pine as the \"charming-not-sincere\" prince gave an especially funny, tongue-in-cheek performance. This movie is a reflection of life itself with a magical fairy tale twist: colorful, touching, energetic, humorous, sad, ultimately uplifting and so very, very well done.",

The characters acting wasn't bad. It shows not oly the good in the character but also a darker side to them. The prince being self-centered and the other characters having a darker and self-centered side was a huge twist in the story. I honestly liked the story being original but didn't like the ending or the way the characters were written. Storybook characters are written to inspire people to do the impossible and over come all odds but the whole prince cheating on Cinderella thing wasn't something that should be taught to younger kids.

It consisted of things happening with no reason or explanation, no emotion shown by any of the characters, a BS line of morality drawn by multiple characters about how decisions don't matter and there is no wrong or right. That is a dangerous message to send to kids in my humble opinion. I am fine with no happy ending but this movie creates an unhappy reason simply just to say it did and that happy endings don't exist.

However, I am going to have to negate most of the posts praising the cast for good acting.  I do not think it is necessarily her fault (I blame the director), but Lilla Crawford as Little Red Riding Hood was unbearable to watch.  She appeared as a soulless singing robot - like a jukebox with legs.  Then again, so did many of the characters.  Meryl Streep's performance was missing something.  I have seen community theatre performances with a more lively and captivating witch.  That being said, the movie missed the opportunity to make Prince Charming and the Wolf the same person, which I have seen a number of times on stage, which adds a layer of complexity.  Instead they threw a dumptruck full of money at Johnny Depp for a three minute scene prominently featured in the preview to get unsuspecting movie goers into the chairs.  James Corden was by far the most interesting person to watch in this movie and Tracy Ullman as Jack's Mother was fun.  If you have seen Into the Woods on stage, you will be disappointed.  If you are not a die hard fan of musicals, you will be disappointed.  If you ARE a die hard fan of musicals, but somehow missed Into the Woods, you will still be disappointed.  Go watch a bunch of nobodies do this on stage, and I can almost guarantee it will be more captivating.",

This is why the \"Junior\" version of the stage musical (intended for younger audiences) ends after the first act. I believe it is pretty deceptive how they've marketed this film. Unless you have some pretty smart kids, do them a favor and  save it for them for when they're older.",

The best part of the entire movie for me was Meryl's performance towards the beginning of the film when she sang to the couple indoors.  The word play was terrific.  I also have always liked the song \"Children Will Listen\", especially the version Barbra Streisand does on one of her CDs.  The rest of the songs, however, were not very catchy or memorable, and that is the one issue I had with the film.  Some of these songs might translate better live on a stage.  Chris Pine was also a standout for me, and he has an excellent singing voice.  I like Emily Blunt in everything she does.  The few children that were in the theater were antsy and fidgety, although there were moments when they were quiet and paid attention, particularly when Meryl Streep was on the screen.  The film's look (sets, costumes and makeup) is stellar.  If the songs were better I would rank it higher.",

The film is a musical... these can be good to a certain point... however two hours in and you will be wishing and praying for spoken dialogue instead of singing. The film cast quite a few b-list actors and Johnny Depp as the big bad wolf (only a-list actor in the movie). The film obviously had an incredibly high animation budget but an incredibly low casting budget... with the exception of Depp. This having been said, Depp played the big bad wolf, his entire performance lasting less than 10 minutes. With a massive animation budget they could have easily created an animated wolf and cut the middle man, saving their budget, which leads me to believe they only had enough money for him to briefly appear. All in all I would recommend you watch it on netflix.... or not at all... and save your money.",

      "text": "\"Into the Woods\" is the musical adaptation of the Brothers' Grimm fairy tales interwoven by writers James Lapine and Stephen Sondheim in this film directed by Rob Marshall. The film stars Meryl Streep, Emily Blunt, Chris Pine and Anna Kendrick with music and lyrics by Mr. Sondheim. I saw the Broadway production of this property and felt then, as I do now, that Mr. Sondheim wears a crown a little too big for his 'music and lyrics\" title and talent. He is a wonderful lyricist but unlike Messrs. Cole Porter, Irving Berlin and Frank Loesser, he fails to succeed as a composer of memorable or even hummable tunes. Take away \"Send in the Clowns\" and \"You Are Not Alone\" (from the subject film) and you are left with a one dimensional writer. Just as Richard Rodgers needed Messrs. Hart and Hammerstein, so, on the other end of the spectrum, does Mr. Sondheim need  Leonard Bernstein, Jules Styne or some other fine musical composer. As far as the film is concerned, and as clever and witty as the lyrics are, the numbers are too long and, as a result, create a movie experience that causes the viewer to wish it would end at least 30 or 40 minutes before it actually does. One must also recognize the obvious intention of the producers to \"get their money's worth\" from Ms. Streep who is over utilized and, as in her role in Mamma Mia, is at her best in a non-musical setting. This is a film where the exceptionally gifted cast is placed in a vehicle not really worthy of their respective talents. I give the film a 6 rating and cannot, in good conscience recommend it.",

In fact, the visuals compliment the score no end which, if listened to cold, is actually fairly resistible without its context. Only one song can truly be considered a hit outside of its theatrical origins and that is \u2018Children Will Listen\u2019, but other songs are still impressive. It helps that most of the cast make a good stab at singing even if one recognises their limitations. Meryl Streep, however, is in a class of her own both musically and dramatically. Notching up her 19th Oscar nomination for her \u2018witch\u2019 she eclipses everyone with impressive ease. Chris Pine surprises as Prince Charming and he belts out one of the best staged songs, \u2018Agony\u2019. Anna Kendrick as Cinderella, Emily Blunt as The Baker\u2019s wife and James Corden as the Baker all have their moments to shine as does Johnny Depp as the Wolf. His rendition of \u2018Hello Little Girl\u2019 (which shows that Disney have certainly moved with the times, since Snow White sang \u2018Someday my Prince will come\u2019) is certainly open to suspect interpretation!",

No wonder Disney quickly had a Cinderella followup in theaters just in case they would upset their fanbase.  Anna Kendrick was a strange choice and I'm not sure she fit in as a gorgeous Cinderella, not saying she's not pretty, but not the best choice for this role.  Emily Blunt was a bit boring when she sang and she's giving me the eye every other scene she's in.  She's supposed to be a baker's wife and she gives off too many looks and signals to the audience, not the best acting that I've seen her do.  The witch and the Repunzel had some strange lyrics to their songs.  She is not her daughter, and that dragged out more than it should have.  The misunderstood witch was frustrating rather than having her be good or evil, they kept her in the middle pretty much saying she's just really selfish.  It's a real shame, almost thought we finally got a good Newsies followup, but instead we got a misunderstood evil movie with some liberal agenda themes.  A lot of the actors and actresses were really good apart from most of the well known ones.

Hilarious, touching, and fantastically musical, the film is a wonderfully entertaining take on the fairy tales of old and their worlds, while adding in a nice twist with the trademark moral of the story. First off, the music is fantastic. Both the musical sequences and score are beautiful and sung perfectly. The acting from Anna Kendrick, Emily Blunt, and Meryl Streep, is very good. Additionally, the direction from Rob Marshall is very good. Without it, this film would have been DOA due to the mashup of various stories. The pacing is good, though it can be a touch frenetic in the beginning, but it was far from detrimental. The script is good and really does a good job balancing everything. The cinematography and special effects are great and capture some seriously beautiful shots together. Into the Woods can also be truly hysterical as it gleefully makes fun of musicals and the fairy tales it incorporates. However, the piece I loved the most was the ruminations on life (and the dangers hidden within), love, loss, grieving, and parenthood. This is where the film is a home run success and truly becomes a major success. Into the Woods can be weird at times and it requires a willingness from the audience to go along with it, but on the whole, it is a funny and truly emotionally moving musical that has fantastic music to go along with it.",

My two young adult children gave up.  I stayed with it because I really wanted to figure out where this story would leave. I finished it on my one. So this is Broadway?  Good luck.  Urban decay?  The musical score was not only irritating but it had no musical anything.  Reminiscent of Will Farrell talking about singing in the movie Elf.  Whatever sordid point the writer was trying to make, he lost it on me, and I am pretty abstract.  I can watch ANYTHING.  What perplexes me is the high reviews and acclaim given to this mess.  What is most unusual is that they had a big budget, great talent, and incredible scenery.",

Despite all the musical numbers, the movie still had an interesting story that added some dark material added into the classical fairytale stories we love like: Cinderella, Little Red Riding Hood, Jack and the Beanstalk, and Rapunzel. Man, it even has some Brothers Grimm material added to the Cinderella story. It's funny in some parts and heart wrenching in others. One of the best musicals of the year, and a fun family musical for everyone to enjoy.",

I think it\u2019s original the idea behind it of reuniting all of those famous children-story characters, and I also think that the music and lyrics are pretty well made and nice to listen; but besides that and the famous actors in it, I didn\u2019t like the film that much. It started pretty well, with a nice all-characters-introduction song, but from there, it just went down. Though the acting is good, the scenarios, the special effects, the characters, it all really looked very unreal, and the originality needed to make that movie should have been a lot more. If the film would have ended in its first half, it would have been awesome. The nice, maybe clich\u00e9d, happily ever after ending, where everyone gets what they want; but sadly, it continued, stopped being a Grimm\u2019s mashup and started being Disney\u2019s, and all that was just awful, they ruined the story. I was bored almost during all the second half.",

If the movie ended when it should have, I would have given this movie an 8 on metacritic because it was enjoyable at the beginning. Horrible pacing can really ruin the movie for you. So I would not recommend this movie because it's just too long and it's shame that this movie could not deliver with some very fine actors and singers.
