I'm not saying the first one had Academy award winning performances or anything like that, but it seemed so more cliche and superhero like this time around, and I wasn't really feeling it. Jim Carry shines every time he is on the screen, and makes an amazing follow up to Nicolas Cages best performance in decades, but he probably only has 30 minutes of screen-time total.

And while I love Chloe Grace in almost everything she has been in, this was her weakest performance, partly due to the horrible sub plot with a bunch of air-head blonde cheerleaders.

Some critics say that \"You should do ANYTHING apart from seeing this film.\" Are you kidding me? I can see why some people might not like this film, but why the f**k would doing a puzzle beat watching this film? Are you seriously that brain dead? Anyway, onto what was good in this film. Every character worked superbly in Kick Ass 2. The big name actors  Jim Carrey, Christopher Mintz Plasse, Aaron Taylor- Johnson and Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz.) do an AMAZING job playing their characters, the score is as awesome as it was with the first one, the action is thrilling, and all scenes stand out as a significant, and memorable moment. Some things that have changed, are such as: the much more hilarious sections, the graphic and somewhat disturbing take on it's comic book counter part and the range of superheroes. (SPOILER WARNING AHEAD) Some things that I didn't like, were the: faceless emotions when a character was killed off, and the sad excuse of relationship endings, just so Dave could have dirty (maybe unprotected) sex with night  Probably my biggest hatred with the film was the climax with Mindy's conflict between the popular high school girls. This scene was very stupid, but it only lasted a few seconds, but man was it just flat out STUPID.",

Aaron Taylor-Johnson slips back into his role easily as does Christopher Mintz-Plasse who is hilarious in this film as well.

The sequel is starting to dissolve around the edges. Gory fight scenes are less and less realistic and actually begin to get boring (except for kick girl\u2019s!). What is doing well in the sequel is the comedic quality of the dialogue, the funny lines, and most of all the mystique of kick girl. What is it with her costume anyway? It is such a perfect vision. Kick girl is such a wonderful vision of a classic archetype. She represents anima in an early developmental but extremely potent state. Given this, it is no wonder she has propelled to such stardom especially with boys and even men. But even as a child, she is not FOR children. It is unfortunate in a way that her potency is rooted so entirely in violence. Theoretically it could have been based on many things. In it\u2019s current incarnation it defines the Kick-Ass brand however, and isolates away this potency into an unrealistic basis which only Kick Girl can really own.

Cliche action scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever make this a great movie for geeks with low attention spans. Obviously the audience will like this movie, as the audience never has any idea what the hell they are talking about. They want a movie that has no regard for realism, a movie where they can shut there brains off and zone out like a drunk 5 year old, and don't care about any sort of consistency. Bottom line, do yourself a favor and do not see this movie, and if you do see it, don't even trick yourself into liking it. You risk insulting your intelligence.",

      "text": "Kick-Ass 2 is a very good movie but it fails to capture the essence of the first film. The first movie was successful for two main reasons. For one, the brutality and in-your-face factor was incredibly high and created a certain \"shock and awe\" that left a lasting impression on the audience. The second was the film's refreshing take on the superhero concept. Both of these elements were either lost or severely diminished in this sequel. To cover the shock and awe, it just didn't have it. There were nowhere near as many scenes that made your peel away and get engaged at the same time. I think a big reason for this was the diminished role of Hit Girl. That's not to say that Chloe Grace Moretz' character, Mindy Macready, doesn't get appropriate screen time. If anything, the opposite is true. At times it almost felt as though she was the main character and the driving force of the film. The problem is that Mindy Macready, though Moretz is a fantastic young actress, is not refreshing or profane enough to deliver the effect Hit Girl does. As for the superhero perspective, while the first film felt refreshing, this film almost felt \"spoofy\" at times. In both cases, I think the directorial and screenplay change from the first film are at fault. Jeff Wadlow clearly had a different vision than many fans, including myself. One last negative, I hated the break in continuity from the movies by changing two characters, albeit they are fairly minor. Detective Marcus Williams (the black cop and friend of Big Daddy who becomes Mindy's care-taker at the end of the first film) and Todd (the less-important friend of Dave) are both played by different actors and neither feels right. Overall though, I hope it doesn't sound like I didn't enjoy this film. Moretz was amazing and Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Christopher Mintz-Plasse both do adequate jobs in the more tradition protagonist and antagonist roles, respectively. The action was really cool and the plot had tons of potential and largely lived up to it with the exception of the aforementioned flaws, in my opinion. If you loved the first film, you'll still probably enjoy this one quite a bit. If you found the first movie offensive, that feeling will not change here.",

The shows that Kick-Ass and Hit-Girl have started a revolution, there were a lot of superheroes popping out and some of those heroes, are joining the team that was formed by Jim Carrey's character. Kick-Ass joins his team and they started to clean the streets but unfortunately Christopher-Mintz-Plasse is still pissed at Kick-ass for what he did to his dad and decides to create his own army. Aaron Johnson is still good at playing his character and he was also good with the dramatic scenes. Jim Carrey was good as well even though he didn't like this movie but he should be proud of himself for playing an awesome character. Christoper-Mintz-Plasse was also good on playing the villain, but the one that always steals the show like with the first movie is Chloe Moretz. She was really good on the dramatic and action sequences and she always steals the show in every scene that she's in. The action scenes were good but some overused shakey cam and I still don't know why they used that thing. The movie was a bit rushed and that's why some dramatic scenes didn't work for me.

Meanwhile Hit Girl (Chloe Grace Moretz) tries to fit in during high school while fighting her desire to suit back up. Kick Ass 2 is a very different monster with a similar filming approach to the first one but the characters are different, the writing isn't as sharp and Hit Girl isn't quite as impressive as she was 4 years ago. The new characters pale in comparison as Carrey's Stars and Stripes is more of a cameo than a supporting role and Night  while amusing plays almost exactly the same role as Lyndsy Fonseca's from the first film (she does return for a blink and you will miss it cameo but its not the same). While not dire, Director Jeff Wadlow's idea of this world is Kick Ass Lite with toned down violence as to appear sanitized, insults that sound rude but cannot compare to the controversial and ballsy ones of the first. It's all half measures as to be safe enough to sell the film to a younger audience who probably shouldn't be seeing it. Ultimately its story is good and the film does take a few risks that really shock but its all a little late as the heart and soul of Kick Ass has been ripped out thanks to the directors odd decision.",

The reason why it is average is because very large sections of the movie are taken up by trivial teenage/family/friend issues and it is kind of slow and boring. In addition, this kind of leads to a lack of action scenes and it does not necessarily help define the villains in the film either. What I liked about the movie were the scenes involving the justice forever team and Jim Carrey added a lot to that as well. In conclusion, there are things to like about this movie, but there are too many unnecessary slow parts (no action) and it is why it is difficult to say that this movie is kick ass.",

      "text": "a piece of advice for you, avoid the critics on this one. the typical movie critic will probably see 1 or 2 movies per week. now, i don't know about you, but watching the same mediocre stuff after a while will get boring. watching someone getting eaten by a shark or be disemboweled from the insides of a car by a lawnmower engine become cliches. Kick-Ass 2 is a movie for the fans purely. do not go into this movie expecting the next dark knight rises or man of steel, because it isn't. it isn't deep, it isn't complicated, and it isn't a masterpiece. and that's all the reason better to watch it and love it. the main problem with super hero movies now a days is that having the main protagonist cracking a smile is the equivalent of shooting yourself in the knee. in a world filled with dark, grit, modern, and deep, it's good to see kick-ass 2 be what it wants to be. is it gory? yes. is it morally questionable? yes. but is it these things because that's what is popular or that's what is making money? no. Kick-Ass 2 does what it wants with no restrictions. is it vulgar, bloody, gory, sick, twisted, vile, and radical. 110% radical. if you are the type of movie viewer that you can't stand it when they don't get the backgrounds of \"captain stupendous\"'s backstory right, you should not view this movie. if you are a fan of cult classic action, gratuitous violence, and fun, then you are welcome to a great movie",

Anyways, Kick-Ass2, I expected some great things from this movie, because of how good the first movie was, but, Matthew Vaughn did not return to direct, but, he was a producer. This was a bit concerning, as I noticed that the new director was none other then Jeff Wadlow, who directed Never Back Down and Cry Wolf, both of which were pretty bad. There were more positives than negatives in this movie. I liked how they developed the relationship between Dave and Mindy, plus the introduction of 'The Motherf*cker' and 'Coronel Stars and Stripes' was pretty cool. Although this movie seemed a bit dumbed down, and much like 2 Fast 2 Furious, it feels as if they tried to do too much at once. Developing many characters and side events in a fairly short amount of time, leaving you out of breath trying to analyze everything that is happening. The main problem with this movie is that much of the comedy was replaced with profane and unnecessary violence, that takes away from the original vibe of the first movie. This seems to have been done for shock value, when really it is just gratuitous and unsettling, it is kind of a buzz kill actually. In the end, this movie was a decent sequel, that fell short from the original, but was still enjoyable, 7/10.",

They are wrong on almost every aspect of what a fun movie should be, I left the theatre extremely satisfied of how awesome this truly was, a great sequel that most can't accomplish but this definitely did the job right. Characters, story, action, revenge it was all there. Only small gripe *SPOILERS* Jim Carrey a.k.a (Colonial Stars & Stripes) who was an ex mob enforcer, died a little too fast in the film even though he had such a badass role it's really a shame. Yea shaky cam these days needs to die off completely, example: (Alex cross) Please don't witness the action sequences, you won't know what the hell is going on it's just all over the place, If you know what i'm talking about then you know what I mean. But here It's great, the fight choreography was done very well there's really nothing more you can ask for, I still kinda wish the movie didn't pace as fast and instead focused a little more on character development and emotion throughout like the first since they pretty much nailed that aspect. Overall I love this movie to death even with it's short, small problems because it didn't take away the experience for me, it actually grew the more I saw it. It had it's serious/funny moments and it blended out really well, It's sort of a Dark Knight of the Kick Ass Movies if you think about it. I'll be buying this on Blu-ray first day, It will have tons of special features, also ones exclusively on Blu-ray with extended scenes, an alternative opening, and 2 hours behind the scenes like the first movie had!

      "text": "I have mixed feelings about \"Kick-Ass 2\". The film doesn't hold up as well as its predecessor, for example. The action is OK I guess, but the plot is just really weird. Maybe the story isn't the problem: the execution is. The humor is again, really weird: you don't know whether to laugh or look away in disgrace. The cast is pretty fine, but some of the many, many new characters are just unnecessary and/or boring. Or stupider. \"Kick-Ass 2\" is not the kind of movie you hate, more like the movie you just don't watch.",
