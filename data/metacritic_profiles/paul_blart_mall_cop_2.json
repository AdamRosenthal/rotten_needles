It was created so that our favourite mall hero, Paul Blart's 'Epic Saga\" could be continued. I enjoyed the first movie, better than that knock off Seth Rogen comedy, Observe and Report. See, Mall Cop 1, was not only funny, but it was more appealing to a wider audience, it was clean, and proved to us that comedies don't need swearing to make their point clear, example: Observe and Report. The sequel just kills my love for Kevin James and Paul Blart. Blart has lost his charm over the years, and boy, it shows, CRYSTAL CLEAR. So yeah, it's terrible, ignore it at all costs, make sure your kids don't force you either. Mall Cop 2 is like a really bad Kevin James movie, add that to a really stinky sock and add a stupid motor scooter to it, equals to a sequel. In about another 6 years, Blart will be back, but this time in a MENTAL WARD. That should have been the location where Director Andy Fickman should have gone when making this movie. Kevin James lost even the 1.2 % of respect I had for him, he is a goddamn president in Pixels! Pixels looks appealing, but it can be ruined, HINT: Adam Sandler and Kevin James together. Overall, this is a piece of horsesh*t, if you didn't figure out already, and yes, it should be panned by critics of how absurdly bad it is. Fu*k you Kevin.",

The comedy was meh and im pretty sure no one asked for a sequel. Basically the same s h i t happens. His fat mexican daughter gets gang banged by criminals stealing some s h i t. Then pauly saves the day and gets no promotion or anything.
