      "text": "I felt this was geared toward religious groups but then had obvious conflicts of profanity and sexual inferences so it therefore hit no particular audience.  It was REALLY loud in my theatre and this also took away from the enjoyment.  On another note, I just could not get past the vast amount of cosmetic changes in Dolly Parton's face and her inability to show basic emotions, especially during close up shots.  She has had one too many botox injections and lip stuffings.  It really took away from her performance and could have added so much to the sensitive plots if she could have really acted. On another note, some of the music was nice but seemed a mix-mash of different genres.  Dolly had to get a few of her songs in the movie so this did not necessarily mesh with the gospel theme.",

      "text": "A mild blend of Glee and fundamental christian values, 'Joyful Noise' will fail to satisfy either parties that would be willing to see it. It has too much sexual content to appeal to those who love gospel choir (though, on the whole, it is still very PG-13) and it is too preachy to be accessible to those who would enjoy the choral arrangements of pop songs. Queen Latifah and Dolly Parton make for formidable opponents, but their clashes never go for the throat and come off as subdued. The plot is also really predictable, almost groan-inducing. So then, what is there for audiences to grab a hold onto? Not much.",

The story was relevant (especially for my 14 year old son, who questions God, as the young man did in the film).  I had heard that this got mixed to negative reviews in Hollywood....It's hard to believe, given the beauty and talent here.  This is one that Mom's should take the time to share with their kids.  We have put four children through faith based parochial education, and yet in just over an hour, they got a stronger message from Queen Latifa, Dolly and an AMAZING group of performers.  Amen to that!",
