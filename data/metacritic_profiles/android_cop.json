I don\u2019t really know what Marvel saw in this film that made Watts look like the right fit. There is nothing wrong with the direction in this movie it does not scream Spiderman This film is very independent and it is shot in a fairly isolated location. Watts does an excellent job dealing with the children in this film. There are plenty of movies out there that make young kids look way smarter than they actually are with all this big elaborate dialogue but this movie is the opposite. You could tell that the kids in this movie were young by their dialogue and by their actions and sadly the children do take up a little too much of the screen time. Kevin Bacon is excellent playing the sheriff in this film. Bacon looks very intimidating with his new mustache and he really played his character well. You had to wait until the end of the film before you really knew if he was a good guy or a bad guy. Cop Car is an interesting film for independent film fans but the movie is more of a thriller than an action film and it by no means a comedy either. There is not a lot of dialogue and there are lot of periods with no sounds so if you are looking for a truly exciting film this may not be your match right now. Besides the slowness the only other issue I had with the film was the third act. Cop Car seems to take the wrong path it its writing when an unexpected problem arises in the story and it seems like Watts wanted to take the path less traveled more than the path that was more interesting.",

      "text": "An excellent thriller that truly understands the essence of what 10 year old boys are like. Consistently funny, nail-biting in parts, with a great climax and featuring one of the most genuinely chilling sequences of the year, Cop Car is a real treat. The final couple of minutes felt unnecessary and the film could have further excelled through the use of a more prominent soundtrack. Regardless, this gem reminded me that Kevin Bacon really is 'the man' and that's no bad thing.",

      "text": "One of my favorite movies of the last five or ten years!  Novel concept and great writing (both plot and dialogue)   - great acting, especially by the three leads (the two kids and Bacon); first rate soundtrack by a unknown to me rock band (usually these suck in indie movies: here the music works with the film and doesn't get in the way) - and wonderful photography.  (Spoiler alert)  A sort of Alfred Hitchcock cum Stephen King approach - two young boys out walking out in the boonies to the local stream stumble across a seemingly abandoned cop car, and eventually take it out for a joyride.  But it wasn't abandoned - evil Sheriff Kevin Bacon had temporarily left it while trying to dispose of a body, but ran into difficulties with the disposal, so got delayed, tired out, took a cigarette break, then slowly walks back to his cop car to get the second body he needs to get rid of .... and the look on his face when he sees his cop car isn't there is a priceless piece of acting (and filming) ....",
