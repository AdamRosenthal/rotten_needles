      "text": "I didn't pay much attention of the biopic. Hilary Swank was definitely going to be a great choice by playing one of the greatest heroic female-empowered aviators of our time, Ms. Amelia Earhart. But this Amelia movie just plain suck. It\"s about 1 and a few quarter hours long and doesn't even have a proper ending to find out more info about Earhart's disappearance. It also didn't help that I was hoping for another Oscar nomination for Swank after her big win in Million Dollar Baby. That didn't happened though the fact that Swank did a decent Amelia Earhart, but the Academy said \"no way. Unless it has a terrible Rotten Tomatoes score, there's no chance in hell you'll ever get a shot at the Oscars.\" Poorly-written but with a splendid cast, but Fox Searchlight just picked the wrong movie at the wrong time.",
