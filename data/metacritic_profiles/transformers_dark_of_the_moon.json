      "text": "This movie was okay, but it really felt tiring and long in the end. Firstly, this movie was structured oddly. For the first hour, the movie felt fine, having action scenes separated by a few scenes of dialogue. It felt nice until the Chicago sequence. This scene took the 90 minutes left of the movie, consisting entirely of every single step these guys had to do to defeat the Decepticons and it felt like a chore to watch it as it just kept going on and on. There wasn't any character development in this section too, just non-stop action. This would be fine if the characters had developed before the scene, but rather are left on a climax and magically end up being developed in the end. The computer graphics looked fine, and it wasn't too impressive since it was done equally well in the past two movies. As for the actors, they didn't really play too well. It wasn't really stand out for me. The dialogue mostly killed the acting for me, because it felt like the actors were doing a mediocre job when really it was just the scripting that's making them suffer. And finally, I watched this movie in 3D, and I can say that it didn't stand out once to me. None of the action felt any better or worse, and it just ended up being unnecessary. I couldn't really tell if anything came out of the screen. Overall, this movie is below average. It is plentiful of action, but if you wanted anything other than that, you're better off seeing another movie.",

So my hopes walking into the theater on this one weren't set very high, but Dark of the Moon really impressed me! Behind all the action, this time we get a pretty good story, one that might even strike an emotional chord in some (think Spiderman 2). There is more depth to the characters and although it has it's funny moments, there is none of the high school humor that trashed the second film so much.

I was at first skeptical of this film like every other person in the world, I grew more skeptical when I learned that Megan Fox was fired...she being one of the two reasons I watched the transformers movies. The other being giant alien robots fighting in fantastic, special effects filled battles, and let me tell whoever is reading this...Transformers 3 does not disappoint on the latter. Yet i did have some problems with the movie because few movies are perfect and transformers will never be one of those few no matter how hard Michael Bay tries. My main problem is the pacing of the movie...just like every other transformers movie, the fighting is saved for the last hour or so in spectacular set-pieces. It was the first hour that nearly killed me here. The first hour follows the forgettable human element Shia Labeouf as he tries to find a job amidst the terrible job market that is the United States SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!! He gets a job with film veteran John Malkovich and asian funny man Ken Jeong...both actors I love. Yet they aren't right for Transformers action oriented style which is immediately apparent. They simply help to develop Sam(Shia) and progress the main storyline. Yet after that horrific first hour you are treated to some further plot development and the realization that **** is hitting the fan in the film. Now the movie gets good...As usual Megatron and his crew are scheming to destroy the autobots just like every other transformers movie to date. And this is the best part, Michael Bay effectively  makes the stakes feel high. Gone are the days where you never saw a Decepticon kill any humans. Theres plenty to go around, and quite frankly i'm okay with that...imagine a sort of War of the Worlds...with Decepticons. And then of course the final hour of glorious robot fighting begins just like the past 2 films and this is where the film exceeds. The fights are beautiful to watch and the set-pieces are exquisite...nothing says awesome like a building collapsing with Shia Labeouf in it. The wing suit sequence also looks terrific, and the action just feels fun to watch. The entire hour long robot-smashing festival was a great redemption for the annoying characters of Turturro and that annoying RC autobot thing from the last film(the one that wouldn't shut up). And it was just good. Optimus doesn't sacrifice himself at every moment he gets and there aren't jokes throughout the entire fight sequences which made it good. My only problem was that any time any of the robots did anything half the audience of the movie theater would start applauding which got really annoying as its an hour long robot fight scene. Other than the bad first hour or so, I liked the movie. Transformers 3 is definitely a must watch for anyone who likes giant robots fighting or any of the first 2 movies.",

Yes the last forty five minutes are ridiculous and crazy, but that's pretty much it, aside from the Chernobyl bit. What we got was basically an hour and a half of Shia Laboeuf looking for a job, then forty five minutes of robots kicking ass. What I wanted to do was forgot about anything that resembled a plot, and  just immerse myself in the VISUAL genius of Michael Bay, but I couldn't because there is just some awful butchering of cinema culture by the screenplay and story. For example I can't focus Shia Laboeuf being swung around holding onto a wire latched onto the eye of a massive decepticon in a flurry of wildly unrealistic, dumb fun, because my mind keeps on going back to the worthlessness of John Malkovich's",

The story takes elements from actual historical events stemming around the moon landing. These events show a deep cover-up by humans who were very aware of the robotic aliens. The plot is coherent and compelling giving much weight to the pacing of the film. Character development isn't as prevelent and this does hurt the movie. Not in a big way but with a story this big, i wanted the characters to have a little more weight. The main point is the action and this is nothing short of perfection.

If you're looking for a movie with super plot and depth, why do you go see movies like this? Overall great summer movie I recommend to everyone",

One being an action perspective (here you study if the special effects, computer animation are well made) and the other being a \"message sending\" perspective (something like dramas, comedies). In the first one I would give it a 10/10 score and in the \"message sending\" perspective I give it a 3/10 score.

With Transformers: Dark of the Moon new and out of the shop many are hoping it measures up to the first film, well it doesn't. It does, however, correct the wrongs of Revenge of the Fallen. One of the improvements this movie makes is that it tones down the humor, its still there and it gets pretty bad sometimes but it doesn't kill the movie. The humor is mostly present during the first half. The first half of the movie is where a lot of my problems lie. The first half of the movie is not paced very well and the action scenes are spaced out pretty far (I know I can't believe I just said that about a Bay film). I know that all of those scenes are there for story and character development but all of that isn't very good in this movie anyways. I would have rather seen some more battles before Chicago. Speaking of Chicago, the last half of the film is spectacular. Its amazing how well it all turned out, and you can really follow the action this time. The movie is also much darker than the other two, and it works the movie actually takes itself seriously this time. At the end of the day when compared to the other two transformers movies this one almost meets the greatness of the first but barley misses. I must also say that seeing it in 3D is really worth it! Dark of the Moon is a vast improvement over the last and is a fun ride from beginning to end.",

      "text": "Not only is Transformers: Dark of the Moon the best of the series, but it's diffidently Michael Bay's best work and probably one of the best films so far this summer. Now unlike a lot of people, I like Michael Bay as a director. Is he great film-maker? No. But he has a lot of ambition, and that's what I respect about him. Michael Bay has made is fair share of good films and some bad films, but I wouldn't call them TERRIBLE films like some people do. Maybe you can call Pearl Harbor terrible, but that's about it. I happen to like The Rock, Bad Boys 2, Transformers, and The Island. Now the Transformers films are, in average, a good series. I thought the first film was lots of fun, the second was mildly entertaining, it was a bad film but had some great moments. Now, onto this film. The plot got really incomprehensible at times. Kind of like the second film, it goes all over the place. But this isn't as a mess as the second film. The plot is actually cooler than that of the second film. And you know what, as much as a mess this was, I really didn't care. I went into this movie expecting robots kicking each other's ass and a bunch of explosions going off everywhere, and that's exactly what I got. People need to understand that this film was made to blow the minds of the audience with dazzling 3D effects, jaw-dropping action sequences, and a great new girl. The film has a plot to back up all of the action, but the plot just isn't well executed. One final thing that irked me as well was the poor character development. There were many new characters that I wanted to get to know more and the film was long enough to get into some of the new characters. Shockwave, for example, basically had almost no screen time; he pops up in the beginning and does some fighting at the end, and he barely says a word. Hangover's Ken Jeong also has a small role, and he nails it. He is very funny. The film is written by Ehren Kruger, who co-wrote Revenge of the Fallen. The writing is fine, nuff' said. Many of the same auto-bots in the other films return, such as Optimus Prime, Bumblebee (who is a bad-ass in this film), Ironhide, Ratchet, Sideswipe, and Weelie, along with some new ones including Mirage, Que, Brains, Sentinal Prime (who plays a large role in this film), and the Wreckers. Also most of the performances are pretty good. Shia Labouf did a great job, as always, as Sam, the new girl Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is great, she can actually act unlike the previous girl. What was her name again? The film also has some strong emotional points with Sam and the robots, which was done really well. Steve Jablonsky's score is awesome! It's epic as hell and it's really well placed into this film. It somewhat sounds like a mixture between the Inception score and the previous Transformers score. Linkin Park's Iridescent is great, though I think they overplayed the opening of the song way to much in the final hour. After a first half of plot and dialog, we finally get kicked off into an action-packed second half with a phenomenal car chase featuring The Dreads (three dog-like deceptacons) and the final battle between NEST, the auto-bots, and the deceptacons. I don't want to spoil a lot of the final battle, so all I'm saying is that it's one of the most epic movie- going experiences you'll ever encounter. It's an all-out war. Nothing else. It's an almost an hour long with lots of fighting and shooting and things blowing up and buildings falling and stuff getting torn apart and everything you'll find in a great summer blockbuster. This IS the summer blockbuster of 2011. Overall, it doesn't have a well executed plot, but you really won't care when the action scenes come along. Believe me. Also, see it in 3D!!!!",

Dark of the Moon is Bay's redemption. DOTM had fantastic momentum, a story that made sense, and surprises here and there. You know haw the commercials for the Blu-ray say \"The greatest action movie ever\" well they're not lying.

      "text": "As a Transformers fan I am quite pleased by this movie. No doubt making this movie after the writers' strike, instead of during it (like Transformers 2), has had a big impact on its quality. There is, of course, a general lack of character depth when it comes to the robots that has been present throughout all three films. Other media, such as the cartoons and the comics, have provided much more in this area and it is quite a letdown that we don't get to see more characters behind these robots. My eyes were overjoyed with a camera that was less shaky than the last movie. I felt as though I could actually tell what was going on. Actions scenes were more abundant than I normally care for, but their pacing and execution were impeccable. Having been filmed in 3D (in a way similar to Avatar) the 3D effects were well placed and were rarely used in any gimmicky fashion. The comedy was much more sparse this movie and much of what was there seemed far less forced or contrived than in Transformers 2. It just seemed to make sense why one thing or another was funny. I sometimes felt like the movie was trying to forcibly tell me what was funny, but this didn't happen very often. The plot was filled with twist after twist that kept the movie rolling right along and kept the action in perspective. A few aspects of the Transformers movie storyline have been retconned (rewritten after the fact) to fit the plot of this new movie. Few will notice these changes, but rest assured, they make the story work a lot better. I rarely go see a movie twice, in theaters, and this movie may end up being one of those rare occasions.",

      "text": "Note: This is taken from my Rotten Tomatoes review just like my Sanctum one. So here it is: Wow. All I can say is wow. This movie is just amazing! Awesome explosions and action scenes! This movie is just all you expect from Michael Bay and more! I have to say that this is the best Transformers movie! It surpasses the first by just a little but beats the disappointing second instalment by a long way! This is Michael Bay's best film since The Rock! Why? Well with this Transformers movie this one actually gets it right with the human characters. The Transformers movies have always been about the robots and have totally ignored the humans but this time Michael seems to have given the humans some emotion. Which is a good thing for it makes the script pretty decent in my opinion. And this also makes you feel something when a character dies in the film. This bit contains spoilers so if you don't want the movie to get spoiled for you then don't read the next sentence. For those who don't mind if the movie gets spoiled are you still here? Good. The following Transformers die in this movie. Ironhide, Que/Wheeljack, Sentinel Prime, Megatron, Starscream, Shockwave, Soundwave, Laserbreak/Laserbeak and Barricade. Yeah Barricade. That Transformer that turned into a police car and the one that was in the first movie but disappeared half way through and never came back in the second one. Yeah that one. He's in this movie. And he finally officially dies. No more conspiracy theories I guess! So to get to the bottom of it a few of the Autobots die but all of the Deceptecons die. Right guys who didn't read the huge spoiler you can come back now. Right so here's all the good points about the movie. It has great special effects and fighting sequences and has proper human characters this time round so both robots and humans can share emotions. Now here's the bad stuff. The jokes can be a bit boring and annoying sometimes so the humour still isn't all that great but it is way better than the second. So as a result this movie gets a 9/10 for having amazing and great action sequences but has a bit of boring humour. So that's my review for Transformers: Dark of the Moon and I hope you liked it!",

      "text": "I would first like to start of this review by saying that the critics are stupid, dont listen to them. They must seriously be paid to rip on Michael Bay or an actual good movie. This movie was absolutely amazing and i recall one of the critics even said 'this is a mindlessnaction film about robots fighting each other and knocking each others heads off' um are you serious, yu do know what the title of the movie was before you watched the movie right, because if you didnt, it was TRANSFORMERS! Thats what Tranaformers is all about, the ongoing battle between the autobots and the decepticons, or as you say it, robots knocking each others heads off. Now onto the movie. I am a diehard Transformers fan, except i only wish i grew up with it, im only 18 years old but i own all of the seasons of the original g1 series, and have seen all of the episodes, and i own ALOT of the transformers figures too, i love transformers and i loved this movie. It had everything in it. Their was mindblowing action, stunning cgi/visuals, and im sure the moronic critics will disagree when i say their was an excellent story going back to original launch of apollo 11, it even included original footage of the landing, how cool is that. Their were so many detailed plots intertwined into this action extravaganza. From sams relationship, to his neverending struggle to find a job, to the space race of the 60's, to decepticons destroying the human race! Their was just so much to this film it was unbelievable. I was in love with this film from the exciting beginning all the way, 2 and a half amazing hours later to the pulse-pounding ending. Their was even some good acting in this movie, not oscar worthy but good enough to get the job done. I was even proud of the job newcoming actress and beautiful victorias secret model Rosie Huntington Whiteley did in this film. At first i thought it would be annoying with nor seeing Megan Fox in the film anymore but that was gotten over real fast, plus, we can all admit that neither her nor Rosie were in the film to make an oscar worthy acting performance, they were there for their incredibly good looks and nothing else. The second film was still good in my opion even though it didnt have a script and the screenplay was written in a rushed 3 months during the writers strike, but yes it wasnt the best film ever created but this new and hopefully not final addition to the franchise is by a million miles better than the first and second film combined in all aspects pf the word. Michael Bay did an absolutely amazing job with this film. Their was the action, and ALOT of it, ther was the eye candy aka Rosie, their were the stunning visual effects which are definitely oscar worthy, Michael Bay did himself justice by using James Camerons technology for this movie and he did a great job with it. Their was alot of comedy in this film, especially from Sams little autobot companion Brains, but the biggest part of this film was the emotion. Their was an utterly HUGE amount of emotion in this film, i felt excited, i felt happy, i felt energized and pumped, i felt shocked and i felt sadness, from multiple parts in the film which i wont go into because i dont want to give anything away but this new edition the Transformers franchise was a massive success. Michael Bay did damn good. Neverr have i been so excited for a film and come out so pleased from it. I hope anyone who reads this will listen to what i say and nothing of what tbe critics say. This was entertainment at its best. I have already seen this film twice now, the promo on monday and the midnight premiere 4 hours ago. I enoued it so much i plan on seeing it as many more times as i can. This was the definition of an epic summer blockbuster, Transformers style. Epic characters+Epic battles=Epic movie. Their is no doubt in my mind that Transformers: Dark of the Moon deserves 10/10 stars, of i could give it more i would in a heartbeat, definitely go see this movie because it is worth every penny of the ticket price. Not only saying this because im a diehard Transformers fan but because i know how to enjoy a good movie unlike the uptight and highly unnecessarily negative critics. My favorite film of all time, thank you Michael Bay for a successful and very entertaining trilogy.",

HELL NO! this is micheal bay we are talkin about . his method is well if it must be that the special effect and action sceanes arnt cool enough. so i must improve that. so what we are left with is pretty much the same lame plot from TF2 decepticons find a wepon to destroy earth and god knows why that stuttering prick shilo boof has to save us all . so most of the movie is focused on Sam whining and complaining how he wants to live a normal life and that no one appriates all that he's done for us blah blah freekin blah. yeah its not like the movie goers dont wana know more about the transformers themselves out side of them just being dragged out to beat the living hell out of each other... noooo we need more shilo . megan fox is now gone and this new girl is brought in cant remember her name and with her god awful acting its unlikely we will see her in much more movies. shes some model who couldnt act well enough to get in a sci fi B movie but apperntly Bay thought she was hot even though her face looks like some one took a metal rake over it for a few days . not to sound shallow or any thing i could have cared less how she looked if her acting was passable like megan foxes was ... maybe thats giving fox to much praise but she wasnt horrable like this girl is thats for sure. in the end if you wana see a mindless action flick with no redeeming qaulitys but its action . you will probubly like this film . if not stay far far far away. i unfortunitly got dragged to this mess cause my 13 year old nephew wanted to see it and begged me .",

First the 3D against my initial pre-conceptions was excellent the best 3D i've ever seen in a film and is by a huge margin the best thing the film has going for itself. But, That's it, That's the only good quality transformers 3 possesses other than the fact that it's better than it's atrocious predecessor; revenge of the fallen. The action is mental as is customary in Michael Bay's films with almost all of Chicago massacred by the end of the film and most of the scenes where someone dies being kinda crap. Fortunately the action is handled in a much more controlled way than the second film with the viewer actually being able to walk out of the cinema without a coma.

He was more concerned with saving a girl which is just met then actually saving the world. Poor guy... it seemed like he was still recovering from his break up with Megan Fox Oops meant to say Mikaela Banes. By the way the new girl has nothing on Megan Fox. Too bad Katy Perry isn't much into acting (yet), she would had made a wonderful replacement for Megan Fox. The movie ran for 2 hours and 37 minutes but it felt like it ran for 5 hours. This movie could not end fast enough for me. This movie was not all bad. The action was what you expected of a Transformer's movie.

      "text": "Dark of the Moon is a Michael Bay film so you don't to expect film art. Like the other Transformers films it's pretty brainless, rather desolate below the surface and has very dumb and cliched dialogue. The difference between DOTM and its predecessors however, is that it has completely embraced its stupidity. The first film took itself too seriously (an amazing feat considering it's about giant alien morphing robots). Revenge of the Fallen was plain awful, not just in an inept way, but in a downright offensive way. This film knows it's big, loud and ridiculous, and excels at it. The effects are stonking and the fluidity of the action is superb. Bay is a true master of carnage. Steve Jablonsky's thumping score also helps maintain momentum through much of the film's colossal runtime. The quality of the acting and of the script is mixed - LaBeouf and Huntington-Whiteley are serviceable at best, but Turturro, Malkovich and McDormand bring a level of professionalism, underused though they are. If there are any true stars of the film it is the voice actors, especially the two principle transformers of the film, Optimus and Sentinel Prime (Cullen and Nimoy). The decision to have two of the most distinctive voices on the planet sharing screen time was a stroke of genius, and will likely result in nerdgasms everywhere. It's not by any means a great film, but if you're in the right frame of mind, Dark of the Moon will give you a rollicking good time.",

Optimus Prime saves the humans when the Decepticons try to destroy it. This time it's a little different though, as Sentinel Prime, ex-Leader of the Autobots, betrays his allies to bring Cybertron to earth. The other plot, there is none. Just filler and slapstick humor that gets old fast. The new female star, Rosie Huntington - Whiteley, is first shown walking in her underwear right when the movie starts off and the camera is directed right at her butt. This is the reason why she is here, because she cannot act for her life (I'm trying not to swear if you noticed). Everyone else in the movie wasn't that great of an actor/actress either. The only redeeming life to this movie is the Robots and the Special Effects. There was hardly any action, and if there was, it was short. Only the end was the good part of the movie, and even then it was still not that great. Especially when Whiteley goes up to Megatron and insults him. Really? Give me a break! No one would ever do that. It's so dumb and makes no sense.

Transformers 3 began with a series of investigation scenes better saved for a crappy Eagle Eye sequel, introduces new threats and goes on for some expected to be epic sequences only to end on the most mundane note conceivable. The main threat ShockWave got close to no scene time and is the given the simple explanation: \"that was ShockWave\", and never heard of again until the end where the most action he got was shooting at Optimus once and struggling with a parachute stuck on his face before getting killed. But regardless, optimus goes on a revenge crazed beat down on him for what I can assume is because Optimus hates it when they call his name and shoots him once. Yeah I played the game, but for those who didn't, this would seem a bit stupid, if not beyond stupid. They kept bumblebee and optimus alive for fans sake and went buck wild with the fates of the other transformers, which resulted in the death of all decipticons and half of the autobots, and having Cybertron implode, just for the sake of having an intense emotional moment that ended in a swing and a miss. Most of the moments ended up as predictable and boring. The movie left questions unanswered and answered some unnecessary questions, don't worry you'll see them. The only thing keeping me from dropping a 0 on this review is the unexpected plot twist in the midpoint of the movie.",

He didn't want to do it, he was forced by Paramount to film it immediately instead of postponing it to 2012 as he told the press, then Paramount forced him to use useless 3D gimmick to raise ticket price... and all of that shows. Previous Michael Bay movies were all excellent although BadBoys2 had some issues and was worse than the first one, but still all his movies were done by a true perfectionist, strong quality control on everything, good plot, good main characters romance and there came the trouble for Transformers3.. he decided to fire his leading actress Megan Fox for whatever personal issues that should never ever affect any professional production like this and then he did even worse casting his worst leading girl to date, the Victoria's Secret topmodel Rosie Huntington-Whiteley which surely has an hot body but a really ugly anonymous face, and more he focuses on her on the movie and more she ruined every single scene, she is just awful trying to act. Also having her play Sam Witwicky's new girlfriend is the dumbest idea ever seen in Hollywood to kill a trilogy, really. And it's like Michael Bay wanted to commit business suicide with this move, otherwise he lost his mind. All his movies since The Rock featured the romance factor and a couple in love viewers could relate to, he spent so much time focusing on Sam and Mikaela characters on the first two Transformers movies that giving Sam a new girlfriend was really just plain stupid.. maybe he thought Sam Witwicky became Will Smith's Mike Lowery character on Bad Boys all of a sudden... well, that didn't happen, couldn't happen and it was just plain dumb thinking anything like that. He ruined Sam Witwicky character. The Carly girlfriend played by Rosie really looks like a prostitute Sam decided to pay for playing his girlfriend or something, and it's not funny to watch. All of this alone was enough to kill heart and soul that the first two movies had along with the hot sexy factor that topmodel Rosie can't give despite porn-style closeups..whenever you see her face unless you liked women with ugly faces you couldn't get excited at all, and whenever she spoke she managed ruining entire scenes. Ok, then what is left? Amazing action scenes and CGI you might tell... yes and no.. I mean the actions are there, CGI is there but: 1) Action scenes look pretty fake most of the time you can spot serious editing issues like they didn't care to fix things up properly; 2) The CGI by ILM it's top-notch on some scenes but really really bad that it looks painted/cartoonish like Hulk(2003) or Speed Racer, two of the worst CGI works by ILM to date. What happened there? Well, obviously the useless 3D gimmick added too much work for ILM to deliver and many scenes look badly rendered, in some you see CGI transformers models looking like they were miniatures moving in stop-motion ancient techniques.. an horrible mistake you wouldn't expect after top-notch outstanding CGI on Transformers2 by ILM. And yes the 3D... is it worth it? Really? Never. Stereoscopic 3D is fake 3D, it hurts your eyes, it's not worth it. And just like Avatar the 3D here is not really used at all anyway. It's all marketing hype. Don't waste you money on the 3D gimmick, they want you to watch it in 3D to rip you off, more money to them and less quality to you along with eye-strain added as a bonus... If this movie didn't have 3D but was just full IMAX 2D and Michael Bay didn't fire Megan Fox it could have worked but as it is it's a huge disappointment for whoever loved the first two regardless the hatred those movies got.

The story is too confusing, the dialogue is laughable, the film is way too long, and the great actors involved are pretty much wasted and are here for the paycheck.  This big budget film actually has three of my favorite actors, Frances McDormand, John Turturro, and John Malkovich.  McDormand has the most screen time so she is the best of the three, the other two are underused.  Now for the positives.  It is better than the second Transformer movie BY FAR, but what film isn't?  Most importantly, the special effects are extraordinary.  Really extraordinary.  The last 1/2 hour to 45 minutes of the film is a loud, glorious, cacophonous spectacle of action and noise.  Although I'm not a fan of 3D, the 3D in the film is MUCH better than most films using this technology.  I'm actually a fan of Michael Bay due to the fact that he did \"The Island\", a film I love, but that film had a great story along with great special effects and remains his masterpiece.  Nobody does special effects like Michael Bay.",

However, I wouldn't judge his films because of that.  The guy clearly is talented, extremely so.  Quite possibly the best action director there is.  My problem with him is the same problem I have with most of America.  The masses are quite dumb and no depth to them.  So goes the typical Michael Bay film.  It's remarkable how someone so visually talented has absolutely no ability to actually convey any realistic emotion or make you feel at all for a character.  Just very surface portrayals.  All that being said, Transformers: Dark of the Moon is his best Transformers film.  He even tells a much better story than either of his previous Transformers films, or any of his other non-Transformers films, for that matter.  The action is not just good, it's freaking spectacular.  The amount of detail and realism in his action is absolutely unmatched.  This was definitely what a summer film is supposed to be.  Considering I've seen every blockbuster this year so far, the action in this film surpass the others by miles.  As a Transformers fan as a kid, seeing Shockwave and Laserbeak play such prominent roles had my 11 year old pants on fire!  Sadly, though, the nearly-40 year-old in me was critical of the unnecessary length, the gratuitous/immature language and the vapid ending.  However, it all depends on what you are looking for in a summer film and, if it's what most people want, I would highly recommend it.  It will definitely satisfy the masses and impress budding filmmakers.",

The lines from this movie that best describe itself include \"this is a clusterf-\", \"what's going on here!?\", and \"Spock goes crazy in this one.\" That last line is foreshadowing of Leonard Nimoy's character's later betrayal and might have been amusing if I hadn't already been so bored by the redundant exposition of the human characters' lives, which drag on forever and still develop practically nothing. The previous movies suffered from the same fault: when the characters have no personality or depth, nobody cares about them and nobody cares during the time they are on the screen. Yet this movie fills so much time with these dull and overacted caricatures. Also, it is possible to make entertaining summer blockbusters without relying on the audience laughing at the movie's self-aware preposterousness. This movie motivated me to create a Metacritic account just so I could rate it down. I give it a 2 because it is better than the second movie (this one does have some funny moments - but oh so few exciting ones), which is easy because at no point does this one literally dangle giant balls over your face. It may seem harsh to be so critical of light summer fun, but one must reflect that every scene of a movie is a conscious decision that could have been made otherwise, and I can think of so many otherwise ways a movie based on the Transformers toys could have been made, even a third installment. The action was somehow boring despite the slow-motion (and here I thought slowing things down was supposed to make them more exciting), constantly rotating gears and multicolored laser lights - probably due to the lack of emotional anything; the plot was lost somewhere on the dark side of the moon; the humor was sparse; the sociopolitical under- and overtones blunt and plentiful (just count the shots of the American flag, the ratio of screen space occupied by medals, the summary execution of the \"intellectual\" Autobot).

Its a movie about giant alien robots and your are looking for perfect logic!? Put a cardboard box over your head with the front cut out and walk around wal-mart, would that be real enough for you? Sit down, shut up, and enjoy the movie cause it really is good. The numbers don't lie.",

As a fan you must admit the movie had the best specail effects that have been out there in years ,the story was good and who cares about Megan fox the othere girl did a good job , I did have a few things that bothered me Like when I ron hide dead there should have beeen some type of word brougth up from prime about the death of his friend seems like at the end of the movie when Prime is about to blow off sentail's head he should have said something about this is for my freind he  killed ,that wold have been a great thing to due ,to me there was no emotion from them about his death.    i know that when you see a movie over and over you can find many  mistakes but  thats the nature of the beast,it a movie for all of us to enjoy and Mike Bay did a great job on that you I  would  like to think that we should thank him for that.   I like to see another one but I just don't see how........... but hollywood always finds away and when a movie like this make when it finishes the movie run it will make $ close to a billion dollars world wide  it has already broke the record for the fastest 500 million mark at only 9 days so we all know  that abiullion is in reach ,it has not been released in Japan or china yet,think about 700 million  movie profit that dose not include  blue ray movies ,rentals toys and all that other  toy items, all should enjoy it for what its worth  and the hell with the cridects  who know nothing,,, long live OPTIMUS PRIME AND COMPANY",

      "text": "I wrote a racist 'poem' and my skype status read: \"i'm sorry, it is not you, it was that **** movie, i say **** and kykes and call **** dykes but transformers 3 has truly offended me!\" My friend may have been offended by the above and asked me why? I think he likes the movie. I replied: \"do you have a spare hour or two? i'll tell you. [15:27:23] calum: leaving aside the obvious lack of knowledge about the Transformers universe, Sentinel Prime (Alpha Trion) [Optimus Prime's Father] {Played by Leonard Nimoy, Galvatron, aka future Megatron} being but one glaring example. The whole use of the word race in general, both that it is used, when in reality the concept is imaginary, to refer to a whole species of robots is absurd. There is no real life proof that 'races' differ in any meaningful way besides minor ecological and geographical adaptations and evolutionary differences like my long thin nose to pick a rather vulgar example, which clearly changed from my African forefathers due to their migration to colder climates, thus allowing the more efficient heating of the air inhaled, to avoid hypothermia with the minor drawback of restricting the flow of air and thus reducing the amount that can be inhaled compared to those in warmer lands. In the movie however, race is used to define all of the transformers, their 'race' being what defines them and what they are fighting for the survival of. Also, the whole undertone of self sacrifice for ones 'race' or even planet, in the case of the humans, i find particularly disturbing as it glorifies suicide terrorism and our feeble attempt to combat such violence in kind. That isn't the morality that i grew up with in the 1980's. The Autobots would never and as far as I can remember, didn't kill anything. Let alone all the decepticons, and in the case of the usually docile and slow to anger Optimus, his own father, mentor and also a helpless and surrendering Megatron. It is this that got Prime killed in the very faithful, if a little market led Japanese Movie 'The Movie'. The Prime I know would never kill in cold blood, but then the Autobots are now an analogy for our brave and noble troops, who often are forced to murder, but Prime chooses this, so even as an example to the military, remembering this is a kids movie and not a rally cry, is still a rather disturbing moral example to set. The best performance was given by the CGI animators, but again, seemed more akin to the brutal comic books than the toys or cartoons with gratuitous dismemberment aplenty. The acting sucked, the script was worse and the director, it would appear is a racist facist homophobic **** Unless this movie is a true representation of the American worldview it can only be seen as, at best, a shameless marketing tool to sell toys with no thought given to it's content by it's creators and at worst a tasteless racist recruitment video for the so called 'war on terror'. The answer to terror it would have you believe is the merciless and complete destruction of ones enemies with no thought given to negotiation or understanding. And why the **** is Shockwave a giant snake with a separate dude that doesn't even talk and never turns into a laser gun? If any racial language used herein is offensive to you it is not intended as you can see above I don't even give the term 'race' legitimacy. Why? Because there is no such thing, simple. If you think you might be of a different 'race' to someone else or if the use of possibly offensive racial language perturbs you then it is because you are identifying yourself that way. If no ones a race, no one gets offended. Which is good because we are not and therefore we shouldn't. The word is used wrongly by most people to differentiate and in this movie, I guess they are using it well to refer to a species, eg the human race, or the cybertronian race. But it is still the wrong word, despite it's arguably accurate usage. So yeah, that's what offended me. Sure people believe in race, sure it isn't real, even surer everyone alive is racist, it is common sence to fear the unknown or the threat posed to the local womenfolk by a swarthy genetically more suitable rival. But when making a movie for kids, who should never be lied to, being so blatantly ignorant and misleading is in my opinion, unforgivable. In fact after watching the movie, i have a good mind to go and shoot all the dirty jews that made it in the head, even if they beg, like Optimus! Megatron is my inspiration no more! His feeble mercy is for the weak! Autobots, transform and kill em all!\" So yeah, don't even pirate this filthy waste of bandwidth unless you... Nah, I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy.",

But uh, finally got bored and went, this summer's been awful as far as good video games go. They're saving up all the big releases for the fall and holiday season. Here's my thoughts, with spoilers. Though really, this film is so dumb it's not the sort of thing you can spoil. -The story here is taken from the comics and the cartoon. When the Autobots leave in a giant ark that blows up, it's from Dreamwave's first storyline in their Transformers comic. And of course, the Decepticons using a space bridge to transport Cybertron to earth is \"The Ultimate Doom\" episode from the G1 cartoon. So... no real complaints there, them using the actual source material is a welcome change as they've pretty much butchered everything else up to this point.",

The story is easy to follow, the action is less nausiating, it is less juvenile (no decepticon scrotum, dog humping robot or John Turturro's ass, thank god), and any scene with Optimus kicking ass is great but it still has problems that made Transformers 2 bad. Shia La Beouf as Sam Witwicky is extremely annoying, overtly whiny and can't act to save himself, his parents are excrutiatingly painful as ever, the girlfriend, though ridiculously hot, is very unrealistic and is only in the movie for fan service and her lips are so big, she outlips Angelina Jolie, most of the human characters are boring and uninteresting, the tone is very inconsistent and it's too damn long. If they just cut out most of the scenes with humans and jusf focus on the robots, it would've been a great CG action flick but it focuses too much on the humans, particularly on Sam whining about his crappy life even though he has a smoking hot girlfriend, an Ivy league education and many job offers. I wish his parents was written out because they have nothing to do in the movie other than just being a pain in the ass. There are some entertaining human characters like John Malkovich as Sam's boss and Alan Tudyk as a John Turturro's flamboyant secretary named Dutch, who has many different sets of skills. What's his story? I am more interested in this character than Sam. Overall, I enjoyed it. Not a good movie by all means but its a good popcorn film.",

      "text": "If most of the girls go crazy about THE TWILIGHT SAGA (2008-2012), I think it is totally OK if the boys have their own toys as well! All the boys need is insanely super cool robots and sexy girls. Thiz one is the third movie following TRANSFORMERS (2007) and TRASNFORMERS: REVENGE OF THE FALLEN (2009). The story still revolves around Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) and his new super sexy girlfriend Carly Spencer (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley). Thiz time, they have to deal with the mysterious origin of Autobots and Decepticons which later takes them to a hidden fact when Apollo 11 landed on dark side of the moon 42 years ago. The movie featuring a real hero of that historical event, the second person who had ever landed on moon, Edwin Buzz Aldrin. The Director is still Michael Bay. I aware that Michael Bay always has a young spirit as it has shown in every of his films, even in his war movie like PEARL HARBOR (2001). But I also have to say most of his movies are always filled with exaggerated brainless actions and comically overacted characters like in BAD BOYS (1995), THE ROCK (1996) and ARMAGEDDON (1998). If not because of Steven Spielberg involvement as Executive Producer that contributes a lot of technical elements, I think thiz would have been a very easily forgotten movie. Yes, the details of Special Effects are incredible. It is very clear that the main attraction is on its robots. The Autobots comprises the famous yellow Camaro called Bumblebee alongside with Ironhide, Ratchet, Sideswipe, Dino, Brains, Wheelie and the leader Optimus Prime, all are back in action to fight for freedom. And the villainous side named Decepticon which comprises Starscream, Shockwave, Soundwave, Laserbeak and the head Megatron that still dreams of tyranny. The robots are voiced by some notable Actors such as Hugo Weaving as Megatron and Star Trek Mr. Spock, Leonard Nimoy as Sentinel Prime. Thiz is one of the very rare cases in which the robots act better than the Actors itself. All actors are drawn to be unnecessary comical characters without exception include John Malkovich, Patrick Dempsey, John Turturro, Frances McDormand, Ken Jeong and Tyrese Gibson.  For the model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, she has the same color of lipstick and hair, it does not mean that she can instantly replace Megan Fox character. You can see she is there only to provide the visual pleasure, not acting. Julie White repeats her overacted performance as Sam mother, you can see that is one of the ugliest actings of all-time I have ever seen. Sam character is not lovable at all. I do not know what Shia LaBeouf thinks when he delivers such a character. You can see he is just a jerk with amazingly gorgeous girlfriend beside him. He looks so **** and egoistic by always yelling and swearing during the entire film. It comes to my mind, maybe they need to get rid all of the human characters in next films, and let the robots deal with their conflicts, just like what we had in original animated TV series THE TRANSFORMERS in 1984 to 1987. Thiz movie has shown that was one step back for the Actors and one giant leap for the robots.",

Everyone is OK with this and they send the Autobots away on a rocket.  No problem, they were hiding in the highly explosive rocket booster and they landed safely somewhere in the Atlantic ocean.  The Autobots manage to get all the way to Manhatten in 30 minutes even though they're 1000 miles away and they can only transform into GM vehicles.  Now we have half a dozen renegade robot heroes who all know karate and can win the war with Megatron by punching and kicking them to death.  Humans already discovered in the last movie that you can take out a Decepticon with three grenades and no one seems to have a few naval ships handy with a couple of guided missiles.  Not even the Obama White House is that incompetent.  Let's not forget that a couple of 20 yr old college kids always seem to get top secret information without any clearance.

      "text": "The third (and hopefully final) installment in the Transformers franchise is just as weak as its immediate predecessor and far weaker than the opening salvo in the trilogy.  The scenario setup had promise though.  The Apollo program and the space race were an elaborate front to get to the moon and check out a UFO which crash landed there.  This crashed ship turns out to be a casualty from Cybertron and naturally holds some cargo which both the Autobots and Decepticons desire.  These events are combined with more historical fiction including Chernobyl and with quality writing could really have taken off somewhere intriguing.  Unfortunately, Michael Bay chose to focus on an extremely uncharismatic Shia LeBeouf and his insecurities of unemployment, jealousy concerning his girlfriend, and wishing he had more recognition from his previous attempts to save humanity.  To extend an even bigger weakness, John Turturro is also back again and now seems like even more of a Daffy Duck sidekick instead of an actual human being.    Michael Bay tries harder this time to make the hand-to-hand combat amongst machines work but anyone sitting in the audience will continue to find it quite challenging to tell the difference between Autobot and Decepticon until they somehow untangle themselves.  Also, the humans scurrying around beneath their robotic feet while dodging falling bits of building somehow never get accidentally squished which should really give a lot of credit to the machines situational awareness.    The Autobot leader, Optimus Prime, reprised his ministerial role and speaks only in philosophical platitudes which contribute nothing to anyone and is most likely why he receives far less screen time to perch on his soap box and spout them at whoever is unlucky enough to be in the room when he begins a sermon.  His speeches resemble a page-a-day motivational calendar.  The female lead this time, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, is not Megan Fox but is interchangeable enough that it does not matter.  Casting also added ensured the new accent brought a British accent with her to make her even sexier to the American male audience.  The first hour of the film has her getting in and out of quite a few low-riding vehicles in extremely short dresses which have most of the audience straining to catch a glimpse.  I wonder if Megan Fox left this series before or after she read this script; she dodged a bullet here.    The new additions of Patrick Dempsey, Francis McDormand, and John Malkovich hold their own with limiting material but Ken Jeong\u00e2",

Transformers: Dark of the Moon is the the third outing of the Transformers franchise and is an imrprovement on the much maligned Revenge of the Fallen. Personally, I thought the negativity towards the second film was extremely harsh it's far from the worst film or sequel for that matter. Dark of the Moon is once again a very long film coming in at over 2hrs 30 mins but it flies by and never seems to drag along. The film this time begins in 1961 with the battle between the Autobots and  Decepticons where a spacecraft known as the Ark is launched carrying an invention capable which is capable of ending the war once and for all however it is shot down and lands of the Earth's moon. In the present day the Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeaouf) is sturggling to find a job after college as he believes he should be working with the Autobots. The Autobots who once again are working in partnership the US military make a shock discovery whilst tracking down Decepticons in Chernobyl. They find a fuel cell from the Ark and after realising the spacecraft surivived the attack Optimus Prime set off to the moon to retrieve the remaining fuel cells and revive an old friend. A discovery regarding the fuel cells leads the Autobots in a race against time to stop the Decepticons initiating a plan to bring their planet to Earth. The storylines have never been compelling and to be fair hardly logical but they are engaging and is sheer entertainment and do bring around some of the biggest action sequences in the cinema to date as thats were Transformers 3 excels. The visual effects are outstanding and its one of the few films i've found were 3D is actually awesome! There's never a dull moment and the action is always on the go and ofcourse there's always a bit of humour added into the pack. The big question coming into this film was could film debutant Rosie Huntington-Whiteley replace a certain Megan Fox as the eye candy? Well let's just say the way she is introduced in this film won me over straight away its unforgettable and whilst she will no doubt be panned in all honesty the role of Sam's sweetheart is more about how hot they look rather than how good an actress they are. The film is an action blockbuster from start to finish and succeeds in that department in every aspect, no doubt Bay and co will have their haters but the film itself does the talking and given the amount of money it has grossed I find it hard to beleive this is the last time we will see Optimus Prime and co!",

It is Michael Bay giving us the middle finger and saying \"It's Transformers, you HAVE to go see it.\".   It makes me a bit angry when people say \"forget about the plot\".  Here's why:  THERE IS NO REASON FOR THE PLOT TO BE TERRIBLE!!!  He could have made a movie with explosions and autobots as well as a storyline that is at least mediocre (i.e. doesn't make your eyes bleed).  He did it in the first one, so I know it's possible.  Regardless, as far as explosion filled CGI fests that pander to the lowest common denominator go, it does kill a couple hours.  I guess terrible plot+amazing effects = mediocre movie.",

The plot is much more easier to understand and I did find myself caring for some of the characters. Although just like the previous films, I can never tell who's who when the robots start fighting.

The movie is like a skate video for robot fights. Michael Bay doesn't want to give you substance, he just wants you to watch cool stuff blow up while you have to withstand horrible dialogue in hopes that maybe you'll find some kind of meaning behind it all, all-the-while questioning how long it actually takes them to go through the events that the cast is going through. Conveying any type of passage of time was lost somewhere on the cutting room floor. And don't even get me started on what they believe should be emotional moments.

The CGI is brilliant and some **** amazing Autobot-Decepticon action sequences are featured throughout, the plot line is really quite simple but it does draw you in quite effectively, with plenty of \"**** **** did not see that coming\" moments and an abundance of 'edge-of-your-seat' anticipation moments that really help get you emotionally connected with the characters (my favourite Autobot died during the first half and a universal favourite...I won't spoil this, but there's certainly a very intense moment with Bumblebee, but I won't tell you how it concludes) the actors are brilliant with plenty of big Hollywood names playing both major and minor roles, good and bad, the dialogue is hilarious and the characters are loveable and engaging. The final showdown is everything that it should be and more (it's not Optimus vs. Megatron, although that does happen) and Sam finally gets some real action, being responsible for the destruction of one of the Decepticon high-ups. I do have three complaints. One-The opening sequence that explains the conspiracy behind the moon-landing, it does drone on for a fair while and features a particularly horrible JFK impersonator. Two- Skids and Mudflap are gone! I know that some people found them offensive, but i found them hilarious, and I think they told the first crude joke that my dad has ever laughed at, which was something of a magical moment for me, the least they could have done was kill them off early on alongside my favourite transformer. Three- The Optimus vs. Megatron showdown takes about ten seconds, granted, the previous battle was the big one that everyone wanted to see by that time, but I guess it all comes down to the fact that since RotF, Megatron has been portrayed as a weak-ass **** and that's one thing that I will not forgive this movie for. Ultimately, this is a must-watch, with a brilliant plot to suck you in coupled with kick-ass moments of **** dude, ****s about to go down, **** **** **** and brilliantly choreographed action sequences. Better than any film in regards to action, but I still prefer the original movie when it comes to plot, but all-in-all, if you're looking for a perfectly balanced mix of Drama, Action, Comedy, Plot and CGI-Epicness, you can't ignore this movie",

The second was a mess with too many plot strands and characters linking towards the rather underwhelming final battle and virtually no main plot to hold it together. Sadly, Dark Of The Moon is actually worse. But not because it has no plot. The basic premise involving Sentinel Prime is superb, but it's comprehensively ruined by far too many characters, most of whom are dreadfully acted, especially the usually dependable John Malkovich, in too many plot strands that, unlike the second film, go absolutely nowhere, and all clutter up the film so badly in the first 90 minutes that by the time the action starts. Terrible editing and an almost wanton disregard for very significant deaths in the series rob two of the most poignant moments of any emotional impact. Not to mention the choice to remove Megan Fox and replace her with a fembot. I don't even like Fox, but at least she could act out more than one emotion, that being \"slightly confused\". Bay's ability to make action sequences look stunning is certainly present, but they are so CGI heavy and the lighting so determined to show off it's HDR abilities on the CGI models that you can't tell what the hell is going on or who's winning. After each battle, you often have to wait for the next dialogue scene to figure out which shiny robot is still alive. All in all, it's just a damned shame. An intriguing plot that should have massive emotional impact for a blockbuster, that turns out to be a confused mess full of throwaway one liners and jokes, none of which are funny, not to mention wasting some serious acting talent on plot strands that go nowhere and rob the film of any momentum.

The second one ..... well i actually felt asleep while watching . At-least this one kept me awake . this one is really the best of the franchise . i like the story which . this story took me way back to the animation series unlike the first two . but the problem is (i don't know why) Bay always focus on the human characters like Sam and Us Military . sometimes it felt like im watching a movie about a war fighting by Military with their Robots . But  Transformers(animated) was like this . that was so wide and actually focused on the different Transformers and more about them . there are more awesome Transformers out there and lot of awesome fighting techniques which were missing . Now acting...... Rosie Rosie Rosie ! She is one of my favorite VS angels ! i was so excited to see her reprising Fox ! i think she did good(as first time) a lot better then Fox (of course) . Siha was more down then the last film as well as josh(i really like his acting but not in this one) .  Patrick Dempsey was good but John Turturro was awesome . as for the voice actors there's nothing to say they are the best of the best .really like Leonard Nimoy as Sentinel Prime. i actually loved the V.effects and transformations it was much more clear and awesome then the last two . Overall it was the best entry but still i expected more .",

I have read many reviews saying it was the greatest 3-D experience since Avatar but unfortunately I cannot confirm nor deny this. I'm considerably more upset by my decision mainly because there is very little else ground-breaking or 'epic' about this film, but first the redeeming features. Much like the previous entries, this is arguably one of the most visually stunning movies in recent memory, from half collapsing building set pieces to the location of Chicago for much of its finale, but the greatest beauty of this feature is the shape-shifting robots that are the Transformers, forget the boring homosapiens that take up far too much screen time, why can't these guys BE the movie, the fights, the movement, the shift from motor to robot is a visual joy to behold (apart from the apparent inclusion of blood, which seems grossly out of place) and the bare knuckle  fights between the autobots and er...autobots ( you'll see). Unfortunately this movie suffered from the Bayesque syndrome that had plagued the previous installments, weak acting from the consistently annoying Shia LaBeouf, an under-achieving debut from Rosie Huntington-Whitely and silly uncalled for cameos from John Malkovich and the Hangover's Ken Jeong. The plot is exasperating as ever with an over abundance on Pink Floyd references to coincide with the films title, far too many pointless scenes, such as the returning Simmons new assistant in a bar fight ( what was the point) because bearing in mind this film Is 155mins long. You owe to yourself to watch the latest installment, it is a vast improvement on the second, the visually stunning set pieces and transformers themselves are marvelllous in their own right, but the movie gets dragged down deeply by the boring human story and needless moments to drag out the film.",

But it is sad that there was not that big a build up in terms of rivalry between the Decepticons and Autobots. Important characters like Bumblebee and (even) Optimus seem to get very little screen time. Genre: It is a pure action film; and nearly two and half hours of it! Gets exasperating after a while; but a bunch of good looking Ferrari's and McLaren's save the day. The story definitely has loopholes - I didn't think for a minute it wouldn't; so no big surprises there. Special effects (which is the reason why people go to a Michael Bay movie): 3D visuals was good awesome, I've got to admit it. The initial sequences of \"clip pasting\" from the past did not seem so realistic. In fact those first few screens seemed way too fast; as if the movie couldn't wait to get to the action mode. Casting and performance: Somehow I NEVER really liked the mom-dad characters of Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf); can do without them really. The new girl (Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) is good looking, but doesn't really seem to perform that well esp. in the intense action sequences. LaBeouf does a good job - fighting (whenever armed) and screaming (when disarmed). He seems to have gotten used to his character! Overall, the casting of the movie was not that great and the characters never really seemed to connect emotionally. I felt it could have been better.

The acting is also not even the least bit serious with people jumping around and doing things I never seen done on screen before. The directing of the camera man was also horrible. There where shots that cut off the top of actors heads and there where shots that I have never seen before. The writing was also very horrible. Even a 12 year old could have written this.

The cinematography and action sequences were really good (though not as good as the first two which I'll get to later) and the acting (minus Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) was also really good. However, this movie just lacked everything else from the prior films. For one, it felt like there was a major disconnect in continuity and this is largely due to Megan Fox's absence. I know a lot of people hate on Fox and claim that she's not a good actress but she is 10 times the caliber actress that Huntington-Whiteley is. Her relationship with Shia LaBeouf's character felt so forced and lacked any authenticity whatsoever that it killed a lot of the character dynamic. The dialogue was also kind of mediocre. There was none of that witty humor that provided a lot of laughs in the first two. And this movie should be used as Exhibit A for why NOT to use 3D in films. Instead of just having naturally flowing action that looks and feels awesome, Michael Bay felt the need, for some reason, to randomly include slow-motion sequences during fights that felt nothing but cheesy. The worst part about the movie though was the plot. It was kind of stupid to be completely honest and it didn't develop well at all. Lastly, I don't think anyone could put it better than Tyrese's character did towards the end when he said, \"Why do the Decepticons always get the good **** Seriously, why? It's like, the Autobots are all stuck with the same generic technology while in each movie the Decepticons have major leaps in tech and that's just ridiculous. Overall, this movie was entertaining to watch from an action-movie perspective because you get a lot of cool explosions and whatnot but it was not all that good of a film in general. Honestly, it just felt like a cash-in and if they make a 4th (rumored for 2014) then it will probably be a joke. This was an unfortunate butchering of what could've become an epic saga.",

Michael Bay's 1st half of this 3rd chapter seemed promising, the story was a little slow but it started to connect little by little. The comedy was a little over the top, but pretty funny I have to admit. This time around, \"Sam Witwicky\" (Shia LaBeouf) is in a new relationship with his new girlfriend \"Carly\" (super model Rosie Huntington - Whiteley). Sam feels belittled by his own ego & the fact that he still doesn't have a job, while his girlfriend has a very good job & has taken the role of provider for him. The man she works for is \"Dylan\" played by (Patrick Dempsey) a very rich yet mysterious man. Up to this point everything seems to be flowing. Optimus Prime finds out that we the humans have kept things from the \"Autobots\" here on earth, it seems that our mission to the moon back in the 60's was more than we \"humans\" thought it was. The mission was never about the moon, but what was hidden on it. A powerful being named \"Sentinel Prime\" he was the key to this chapter, I won't go into spoilers. Again up to this point it's flowing, it's what happens after they find this being, that totally **** this story & film up. It goes from being rather good to very bad in a matter of minutes. Here we go, 1st of all the story gets ruined 1/2 way into the film. 2nd, the film is way too **** long, like way too long. My brother & I figured we could of edited at least 40 to 45 minutes of unnecessary footage. Made the film 2 hours long, instead of the whopping 2 hrs 40+ minutes. It was just very prolonged, which brings us to my 3rd complaint. Not enough action, this is a sequel therefore action sequences are a must, specially in a Michael Bay film. I felt the film was just badly edited, it didn't flow right, in some parts it was right down boring. Now I can't go into too much detail without ruining the film for you. What I will say is that everything that leads up to the final battle in downtown Chicago, is just a **** tease. The battle really never takes flight, the \"Autobots\" seemed tired & just not what you'd expect. The star of the entire trilogy \"Optimus Prime\" was nowhere to be found 2/3 of the fight. This film was just too much blah - blah - blah, not enough action & not enough \"Optimus\". Michael Bay really **** this one up, but the good news is this will be his last take on \"Transformers\". The one thing I learned from this film is if you're gonna make a bad film, don't make it long in duration. For you just not only piss off your audience, you bore them as well. Thanks a lot, Mr. Bay.",

Sometimes, the film awkwardly tries to be funny at points, but very occasionally, you get a very small amount of laughter. The story-line is more thought out, in basic terms: it had a better and more interesting plot. The action was more intense and the dialogue was a bit better than the first and second's.

Michael and the writers were able to incorporate an actual story this time around that actually did make sense, even though there were times were it would break away from the story, which didn't disappoint to much as it was interesting to break away from the plot and see what else was going on. I felt that they did an excellent job of bring more emotion into this movie than the others which is great. If I had only one criticism, is the fact that I didn't like the acting of, new to the big screen, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley which I felt struggled with showing her emotions and overall acting as good as Shia LeBueof.

Some of the plot twists are idiotic, and it lacks a true sense of grandeur like the first movie had.  It overloads on c.g.i. way too often, the robots seriously need to shut up, and when it's over it's over.  Nothing truly lingers beyond the running time.  There's nothing to think or feel about.  An impressive action scene or two can't give a movie a soul, or a good story, or a brain.  Like I said, it's not as bombastic as the second movie, but if Bay's going to keep milking this cash cow, (and we all know he will), he should seriously look at the first movie again, and see what he did there.

After the hate the last one got from pretty much everybody, I guess Bay decided not to muck up his next as much. I mean don't get me wrong, none these three movies are really that good. This one is entertaining and less offensive than the last one. For starters no twin robots, that's a positive in my book. Okay so I'm tired of the racist stuff about them, I think they're racist stereotypes, but I just hate them because they were so fricking annoying in that last one. Anyways back to this film, the only offensive stereotype to come out of this movie is probably that Asian guy who was in the Hangover. Action in this movie; obviously, is great to look at, but at times bring up questions. Like, how does shockwave drive that worm thing? Where do these new autobots come from? Why were Decepticons hiding on the moon for so long? And why do transformers have to be involved in Chernobyl? That's the main problem with this movie; of course that's debatable, that while all the action and spectacles are occurring, it causes much more questions. I could give any less care for the main character, I grown tired of him, so I don't even care. The new girlfriend however is a bit better, not by much, but at least isn't as bad as that last chick was.

      "text": "This movie has a ton of great action sequences (they get better every movie), but it has a clich\u00e9d and predictable plot, it has the same immature jokes, sexism and racism as Revenge of the Fallen, just in smaller proportions. But the worst thing about the movie was Rosie Huntington-Whiteley's dreadful performance. It was just awful, awful, AWFUL! In this movie, she acts like a dumb brute who does nothing but scream, holler and look pretty. She makes Megan Fox look like a Oscar-worthy actress. Overall, Dark of the Moon is an improvement over Revenge of the Fallen, but it is still a hollow experience.",

      "text": "While it is more watchable than revenge of the fallen, it still has some of the same problems. The story and it's characters are actually more interesting than the previous 2 installments, but it's execution isn't that good, with it once again focusing on the human characters than the transformers. While the transformers do get more screen time than revenge of the fallen, it's not enough to make it more compelling. The human side of the story is just as dull as the other two, but somewhat better. Once again the special effects are pretty good, and the final act of the movie has an action packed end to it. Even though I don't care about the characters, I still enjoyed watching the final battle in Chicago.The humor in this movie is toned down a bit, but when it shows up, it attempts the same jokes as the other two movies, which isn't good. Overall, while it is better than revenge of the fallen, the story, characters, and overall structure of the film doesn't work, and I wouldn't really recommend it.",
