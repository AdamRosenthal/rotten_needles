For anyone out there  reading negative reviews ignore them and judge for yourself, cuz if you don't you will be missing a great movie that is full of suspense, chilling anticipation and pretty much none stop action.  It takes a lot to scare me with exorcism movies, but this one had me on the edge of my seat  biting my nails, a lil anxiety and even at some points gave me goose bumps.  This one will be added to my horror movie collection and will most likely be watched five to ten times.  Glad I decided to watch 'The Vatican Tapes' despite the negative reviews, the title and even the trailer.  Keeping fingers crossed that there is a sequel or even a prequel just as long as the creators create something, they did an awesome job (actors too) as far as I'm concerned.",

      "text": "I haven't had such low expectations for a horror movie in a while. The trailer wasn't flattering at all and made it look like an incredibly generic found footage exorcism flick, and now that I've seen it, I can confirm that that is only half true. Despite the title, it's not a found footage movie, but it is a generic possession movie. In The Vatican Tapes, 20-something year-old Angela (get it?) gets possessed by a demon, but it's not just any demon; it's the Anti-Christ himself. A priest and two Vatican exorcists team up to try to exorcise Angela before it wreaks havoc on humanity. Surprisingly, The Vatican Tapes is actually a movie that gets better as it progresses, although that's really not saying too much. The first act of the film is its worst. Every exorcism movie cliche you could possibly think of is stuffed into twenty excruciating minutes, and it definitely made me fear for the rest of the movie. After that, The Vatican Tapes does get more interesting ever so slightly and has a couple of decent scares because Angela is now in a mental hospital, but still nothing we haven't seen from other, better movies. A black raven has to announce the next \"scary scene,\" which completely ruins any tension the film might have had because the audience is now going to expect the next big obnoxious jump scare. The plot eventually decides that there should be an exorcism scene, and after a particularly lazy attempt to say why Angela is discharged and sent back home, the audience finally gets what they paid for. The exorcism scene itself takes up the last 20 minutes of the movie. It's admittedly pretty cool to watch since there are a few creepy and intense parts, and the pace slows down a bit to allow some atmosphere to build up. There's still this inescapable feeling that everything is still all too familiar to anyone who's seen a good possession movie. Then the ending comes. The ending is actually the only part of The Vatican Tapes that I wholeheartedly enjoyed. It ended the movie in a rather dark and powerful way, so much so that I'd like to see a sequel just to see where they could go with that ending. Even with the surprisingly good ending, it's not enough to warrant a recommendation for The Vatican Tapes, a been-there-done-that exorcism movie that has about as much soul as the possessed Angela. Another day, another exorcism.",
