This should be celebrated not dismissed. Though I'm not a huge John Hughes fan, this film is reminiscent of Hughes' films. I look forward to the director's next outing.  The film has many cultural and music references that some people will not understand, and might cause them to dismiss the film.  I know I did not get them all.

However, the situations our protagonist finds himself in and the overall message and themes presented by the film are incredibly important and certainly resonate quite strongly as you watch this one unfold. The characterization and writing of the characters is why I commend the script and the way it unfolds. The plot is secondary and the real stars are our protagonists, who are wonderfully crafted and certainly ring true.

My only complaint is that I would have liked to see a little more character building from the main leads. We\u2019re told repeatedly that they are geeks but they never really do geeky stuff.",

It began like any other movie, but blossomed early, stayed full, and punctuated the end with a very satisfying mark.  I loved it, and it will remain a classic in my memory.",
