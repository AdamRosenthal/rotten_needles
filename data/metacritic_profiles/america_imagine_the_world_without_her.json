I was however pleasantly surprised by the overall presentation. I agree with many of the professional critics that seem a little confused as to why he begins the film with the premise of General Washington being killed by a sniper and I expected a documentary about the world without America. Of course the film moves away form that premise and towards a general discussion of the \"indictments against America\" and a soft rebuttal to them. So that abrupt change in direction was a bit awkward. That aside, this was a very fair representation of two schools of thought about America and her place in the world. Clearly D'Souza has conservative leaning personal beliefs and this film makes no effort to hide that. it can and should be noted that, neither did Michael Moore with any of his popular documentary features. Unlike Mr. Moore, D'Souza is mostly respectful towards those with opposing viewpoints. The movie is not an all out assault on the left but rather an gentle nudge towards the idea that America is not nearly as bad as some on the left insist. The film will touch on sensitive subject matter, but I believe handles it in a professional and respectful way. Mr D'Souza opens the narrative with the calm statement that  \"I Love America\". Make no mistake that he shows a bit of patriotic pride towards the end of the film. Whether you are a dyed in the wool lefty or a hard line righty or somewhere in between... This is a good movie to watch and think about. Put aside you angry politics and soak in the idea that America has been both a shining beacon on the hill and the occasional oppressor. But in the end, America has worked to right her wrongs and help others achieve the better opportunity we have enjoyed. Perhaps we are not as bad as some say we are.",

I find it ironic that critics are accusing D'Souza of making straw-man arguments and withholding key facts or arguments in the discussion of slavery, capitalism, etc. D'Souza does nothing of the sort.  He very fairly states the general accusations of those on the left who accuse the US of illegitimacy because of slavery, capitalism, imperialism, etc. He pokes holes in arguments made by well-known professors and political commentators on the left (Noam Chomsky, Howard Zinn, etc.) and fills in critical details intentionally left out to support an \"America is evil and needs to be re-made\" conclusion. This is definitely NOT an instance where D'Souza parades up a bunch of light-weights making specious arguments. I find it laughable, but sadly not surprising, that several very left-leaning critics gave America a \"0\" out of 100.  I note that these same critics thought some hatchet-job documentary on the Koch brothers (I know - even the mere mention of their names should cause all acceptably left-leaning citizens to convulse in anger) was \"passionate\" but \"fair\" and not \"vituperative.\"  They even gave Transformers close to a score of 40.  It's obvious that these critics measure the worth of a documentary not on its truth or accessibility but on its political message.  Ultimately, it appears a \"good\" documentary starts with a conclusion they support, e.g. \"corporations and Christians are bad and big-government atheist liberals are good\", and then selectively back-fit data to support this conclusion.  Oh, and if you can sufficiently rabble-rouse and inspire people to rise up against \"the man\", that makes the documentary even better.  Since America is a fair and compelling argument in defense of the \"idea\" of America (quoting Bono from US in the movie) - that of liberty, free enterprise, and entrepreneurship - this does not sit well with several of the critics who give the movie a score of 0.

      "text": "\"And in other shocking news, leftist movie critics give 'America' horrible reviews.\"  Let's be honest for a minute: This movie is good, but not awesome. But the great thing about this film is it's truth and a lack of lies, crudeness and vulgarity, all of which, apparently, must be present for modern movie critics to hold a film in high regard. Take yourself and your family to see a film that puts our country's and its sins (...and its great accomplishments) in perspective. America (the country) is exceptional, not because we're \"better\" than other people, rather we're exceptional because have largely been an exception to the typical tyranny that most people in history have had to live under. Critics apparently cannot comprehend this notion, so go see this decent film and pray that we can remain a nation of freedom (a true exception in the world).",

Liberals don't argue on truth or facts but on which this film will be hard for them to stand corrected by their errors about history. But it doesn't matter because once somebody is wrong they will find a new excuse and loophole to protest their cause to be right, just as the kid who says I know it was wrong to hit him but he started it first. Two wrongs don't make a right.",
