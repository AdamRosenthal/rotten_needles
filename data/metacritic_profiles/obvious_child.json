The thin, unimpressive script always feels like it's leading somewhere but never arrives at a recognizable destination. Watch the trailer, and you'll pretty much see what this underwhelming offering is all about.",

Robespierre centres her talented cast around Jenny Slate, who's performance boasts both hilarity and subtle emotion, so that even the coldest of us end up rooting for her as a protagonist. It's refusal to make a grandiose statement on behalf of a community makes this movie both relatable and contemplative, forcing the viewer to imagine themselves in such a position. Only the most hardened fundamentalist should have an issue with this film, despite your personal beliefs on the subject.",
