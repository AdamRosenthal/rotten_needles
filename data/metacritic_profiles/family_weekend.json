It has some enjoyable moments and a few goofs but the thing is that the film is a actually original and this script hasn't been made again and again. Of course it would have a happy ending but that's something we knew from the start. The girl's performance was really good too. That's all I have to say for that movie that needs your attention and many people will like it and many people wont like it for some reasons. I enjoyed it at some points. That's all I need to say.",
