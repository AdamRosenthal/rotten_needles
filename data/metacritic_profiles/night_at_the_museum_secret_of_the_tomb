It intends to be ridiculous, joyful and hilarious, especially the monkey character, Dexter which impresses the most are all the main factors that the film is suitable for family goers on Christmas. The film would be a complete disaster without Ben Stiller to lead, but this does not save the film to look dull, not so funny with lame jokes, weak scores and to look inert. Overall, it is a disappointment as this family franchise film lacks of inspiring message, burns off the original film's energy and ideas, and ends losing all the magics abruptly.",

The story was the weakest part of the movie for most people, but not for us. It was silly, sappy and sentimental. Just what we want to escape to instead of reading the latest horrors in the world. It's about people who have no common interests, no common culture to relate to, and are centuries apart in age and ideals. Yet they mostly get along and care about each other. If only that was real life. It was bittersweet seeing Robin Williams and Mickey Rooney (died at 93 after a 91 year career in show business). The Movie has a wonderful goodbye scene for Robin as Teddy Roosevelt. The good feelings from the movie made us leave happy with the magical theme of people of all kinds getting along, which of course, is fantasy in real life.",

The acting, of course, was incredible.The scene where Akmenrah met his parents almost, ALMOST, made me tear up. You could read his emotion on his face - his love for his family, even after having not seen them for years. Robin Williams' final lines were more than a bit touching. The SFX were great, too (the constellation scene had me spellbound), but could have been better. The ending, on the other hand, left a bit to be desired. They had it set up well enough, with Akmenrah choosing to stay in London with his family and the tablet, while the others left back for New York, but I was expecting more of a relationship between Larry and Tilly. I was hoping that Larry would teach Tilly about the magic that was now her job every night; I was hoping he would help her learn how to handle the live dinosaurs and tigers and mammoths and war criminals; I was hoping he would at least warn her about what was going on - the two are kindred spirits now, after all. But no, instead the only thing he tells her is that she'll have the \"best job ever.\" Then it jumps to three years later, which disappointed me because I was eager to see how Tilly would handle her new-found responsibility and how Larry fared after the loss of his night show and if Nick ever went to college or not. This wasn't the only part that left me frustrated either. There were scenes when I felt the camera was focusing on entirely the wrong thing. During the roof scene, I wanted to shout at the screen \"Who cares about the monkey when Akmenrah is crumbling to dust after just having reunited with his family for the first time in decades?!?\" Although, in all fairness, this is a children's movie, and children would rather focus on the monkey. There were also some scenes I felt were a little unnecessary, such as the romance between Teddy and Sacagawea that was thrown in there at the last minute just for good measure (come to think of it, did Sacagawea even do anything in this movie? It seems she was just off to the side the whole time. I wasn't paying attention to it while I was watching, but I don't think this movie even passed the Bechdel Test). The same goes for the monkey-kiss scene in the falling action. Just because the main character didn't have a female love interest doesn't mean you can substitute in a monkey. Even though I had my quarrels with the falling action, the resolution ended on a positive note. The magic wasn't gone. It will never be gone. It just moved somewhere else to allow for new adventures and misadventures. With that said, I feel I should emphasize that this film is for children and families, and some of its shortcomings may be excused because of this. Despite its flaws, I actually enjoyed the movie while I was watching it, and if I didn't appreciate these movies enough as a kid, I certainly do now.",

They done a good job with the movie wrapping up and it was nice to see all them back together again.  I can say the movie was a little slow at times, but did eventually pick up speed and pace.  The story was OK, but could have been better, still I gave it a 7 just for the fact that it was wrapped up nicely so we could all move on from the series.",

      "text": "Definitely the weakest of trilogy but still fun. I loved going to London and seeing all the new exhibits come to life. sir Lancelot was a treat to watch and was probably one of the best character. we also get a fantastically developed back story to the tablet. This movie takes alot of inspiration for the first. For example back is the party scene at the end we get more of robin Williams as teddy Roosevelt more rexy once again because teddy Roosevelt travels with him to London. The action once again is fun and Hugh jack man makes a hilarious cameo. dick van dyke comes back after being absent in the first movie for a short but worth while scene which adds some back story to the tablet. Speaking of which when there were flashbacks to the tablet the ancient Egypt scene were effective and although they were extras no white washing. Micky roony dick van dyke and bill cobs come back briefly but it was good to see them again. Ricky Jarvais as always does great as Larry daily's sassy boss. What keeps this movie from being great are a couple of things. While not completely gone gone is mostly the smart humor Ben stiller seems more grumpy than in the previous too which i didn't like. Russel Wilson as the night guard lady was OK but not the best. Also any scene with laa was not done very well. I understand he was the comic relief but he was not very good but i see it was defiantly a character geared more toward kids. The father son relationship sub plot was completely under developed and didn't add much to the movie. However even with these flaw the movie still maintained the joy the others brought in a fantastic last performance from Robin Williams and mickey roony keeps this movie as one of the weakest yet still enjoyable and a surprisingly satisfying ending to the trilogy films",
