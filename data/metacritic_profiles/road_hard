On his podcasts and classic Loveline, when at his most entertaining and interesting, Adam Carolla is spontaneous and unhinged.  In the film he is quite the opposite, coming across as rigid; a stiff actor, indeed.  But it is not only the Carolla performance, but the entire film emits a wooden aura.  The film may have benefitted from a looser, improvisational style exhibited in a show like Larry David's Curb Your Enthusiasm, because of Adam's very similar comedic style and acting ability (or lack thereof).",
