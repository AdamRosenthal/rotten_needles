Most of them started in the 1960s and were backup singers on some of the most famous records of all time.  In a couple of instances, they even sang the lead on some hits but the credit was given to other singers who did not sing on the record at all.  These women are legendary within the music industry and certainly have the talent to be stars, but why haven't they?  The documentary tries to answer this question by interviewing big named stars that have used these ladies on their own records over the years.  The film features a lot of great music, and it makes you think about how many extremely talented people there are in the music industry and yet never become stars, and yet many of the pop stars of today can't sing at all and have to lip sync when they perform.
