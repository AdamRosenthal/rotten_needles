      "text": "They look like toys, but they're not. It must really burn this sorry lot, to come up short against their rivals, and yet the filmmaker doesn't go there. \"Gnomeo and Juliet\" never gets past its initial conceit. The film simply wants to goof on William Shakespeare. Too bad. The pathos goes unexplored. The gnomes are cute, distinguishable by sex, and their faces suggest a personality, but alas, the gnomes aren't kid-friendly. The parts don't move. They don't make a sound. Worst of all, they're ceramic. Nobody plays with lawn ornaments. (Can you just imagine the people at Pixar exploiting this fact!!!) Nobody loves them. It's a reality that the makers of \"Gnomeo and Juliet\" never acknowledge, preferring instead to infuse the mindset of the lawn ornament with a toy's logic, a toy's undying loyalty. The feuding gnomes, in actuality, have no surnames. As it's revealed in the opening shot, after the Andy Kaufman-esque prologue(similar in theme to his \"Great Gatsby\" bit), the Montagues and the Capulets are appellations that refer to the gnomes' human owners, next-door neighbors at odds who reside on Verona Drive. Even though the gnomes wear the tribal colors of their respective landowners, blue(Montagues) and red(Capulets) shouldn't signify anything because the gnomes, by all appearances, are not on a first-name basis with the people, the warring factions whose problems they appropriated as their own. To the actual Montagues and the actual Capulets, the auxiliary members of their families that occupy the gardens, are ciphers, so where does this loyalty come from, which inspires the gnomes to keep Gnomeo and Juliet from being together? Not once do we see, Montague or Capulet alike, performing some sort of ministration upon the gnomes to indicate that the lawn ornaments have value, akin to a toy. For instance, when Tybult shatters and is reduced to tiny pieces, due to a lawnmower racing accident, a savvier film would have shown who(person or thing) was responsible for the gnome's eventual restoration. More than likely, it's a lawn ornament who mends Tybult, but each group's allegiance to his namesake would lead you to believe that the glue belonged to a proper Capulet. If human hands put Tibult back together, you could understand better as to why the Red Hats and the Blue Hats can't mix. But as \"Gnomeo and Juliet\" makes clear, the film has no Andy(the boy from the \"Toy Story\" series\"), a human representative who interacts with inanimate objects, and loves them. Clearly, these lawn ornaments are forgotten, and left to their own devices. Their real grudge should be with the toys, who sleep in the house, on a shelf or a bed, instead of having to brave the elements: the rain, the sleet, the snow, and the neighborhood cats, the neighborhood dogs. Toys have value. Toys get fixed. In essence, \"Gnomeo and Juliet\" wants to be \"Lawn Ornament Story\", especially during the scene where the pink flamingo recounts the story of his pink flamingo mate, which contains the same \"Toy Story\" approach to loss, evoking the moment in the second film when Emily, Jessie the Cowgirl's owner, tosses the doll under the bed, and is forgotten. \"Gnomeo and Juliet\" is equally adult in its handling of abandonment issues. Tossed into a garden shed, the aftermath of a separation between the flamingo's owners(she took the other bird), Featherstone muses, \"Other people's hate destroyed my love\" but the moviegoer never gets a read on how the pink bird feels about their indifference, the casual cruelty which led to his imprisonment in that shack. In Lee Unkrich's '\"Toy Story 3\", Lots O'Huggin Bear couldn't survive without his human, so as a coping mechanism, he unleashes his anger upon Woody and Buzz Lightyear, and the rest of Andy's toys, because in the stuffed animal's state of bereftness, he despises the newly-arrived toys at the daycare for the same reason he despises himself: the bear needs his original owner, he needs love, whereas the gnomes need no human interaction, and yet, both sides are willing to fight in their honor. Prior to the final action set-piece, just like how Shakespeare wrote it, Benny breaks into the Montague household, and using the computer, orders the lawnmower that will give the \"blue hats\" an advantage over the \"red hats\". The Terra-firmanator, under his command, nearly kills the star-crossed lawn ornaments, and what for? Had Benny been successful, the old lady would have simply swept away the ceramic pieces into a dustpan, without ceremony. If the makers of \"Gnomeo and Juliet\" had Pixar's ambition, they would have made Juliet a toy.",

Young ones will love it, and even though I am decidedly not in the target demographic, I was mesmerized by the vibrant and colorful graphics.",

I really liked the new songs from Elton so I suppose I will have to purchase the soundtrack now.  The animation is excellent - very colorful and textural.  The story itself is, of course, predictable, as it is a retelling of Romeo and Juliet, but of course nobody dies tragically at the end since it is a children's film.  There are no big laughs, as with a Pixar film like Toy Story, but there are no boring or slow parts either.  I just found it fascinating to look at so it kept me entertained.

I was curious to see how the ending went and I was very pleased when the gnomes didn't die. I think the idea is very creative, who else would think to make a spoof-like movie about gnomes on ShakeSpears Romeo and Juliet. For a kid movie I really enjoyed it. It has bright, cute humor and the characters arn't perfect and are enjoyable. People are rating this bad because they think the animation is bad, well it's not. Also all the other animated kids movie: Toy Story 3, Cars 2, ect are lame in the plot. Cars 1 was ok but they're just going to run the whole idea of it right into the ground. Gnomeo and Juliet is filled with surprised and the plot doesn't falter nor is it run in the ground so people are bored. The humor wasn't always in words but in facial expressions and body language. If you actually watch the movie and tried to read into it it is a very enjoyable watch. I highly recommend it for kids 1-13. I think even the teenagers would enjoy all the humor and like the funny twist on Romeo and Juliet. I'm definitely not saying that adults won't enjoy this film because I can almost guarantee that all ages would enjoy this movie. I like how there is action and romance and comedy all mixed into one great retelling (sort of) Gnomeo and Juliet. If you saw this in the theaters with your children you would be entertained as well. I don't think this movie is down right hilarious every second but what movie is? If everything that happened was funny the whole film would be cheesy, boring, and pathetic. I like how this movie balances it out nicely so the humor doesn't let you down or get boring unlike probably a lot of other comedy's that have no meaning, no plot, and people made out of boredom. If you didn't like this adorable, sweet movie then fine, be a Grinch. You can be ugly and sour about this movie all you want and have extremely high standards when it comes to movies then fine but you don't have to put down negative comments. The whole world doesn't really care whether or not you yawned the whole way through it. I think if you don't like it you should not purposely go on a review site and dish about a movie you didn't like. This is definitely a movie thats worth seeing, just to see if you like it or not.",

On one end the film as some good animation, some likeable characters, and does a nice job in some parts telling the story of Romeo and Juliet for kids. However, just when the film seems to getting heartfelt and doing a nice job with the whole message on prejudice it shoves a lot of pop songs, pop culture references, and adult jokes down your throat. If this film was just a bunch references and pop jokes I would be giving this film a 4 or 5 but because it does have some moments, more or less the same basic premise, and some of the adult jokes work it is getting a 6. I was not bored or groaning as much as I do in other kids films and this one kept my interest to an extent. If I had kids I would still show them this because there is nothing terrible or bad in here. As it is Gnomeo and Juliet is a nice adpation of the Shakespeare classic except for when it tries too hard to be hip and appeal to older kids and adults. But other than that it is a decent flick. Not going to recommend this one or dissuade you from seeing it but if you wind up watching it the film is not as bad as it could have been.",

Some of the voice work was a little bland, but I still had a fun time with this movie. A really cute little animated film!",
