      "text": "Humpday makes a refreshing change to mainstream film drudgery. For a film about two straight guys deciding to make a porn film together, it's surprisingly deep, witty and honest. It's so original and off-the wall that you'll never see another comedy-drama quite like it. The story hinges on the believability of its two leads, so thankfully both Mark Duplass and Joshua Leonard put in great performances - they're natural and relatable, and carry writer/director Lynn Shelton's highly original story along nicely with their effortless, entirely improvised dialogue - you don't doubt for a moment that Ben and Andrew have known each other for most of their lives. Humpday is a film experience like no other. There's no pretension, no hidden agenda, it's just exceedingly clever, unquestionably funny minimalist filmmaking.",
