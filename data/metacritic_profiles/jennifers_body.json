It's certainly not the excellent writing, the awesome directing, or the competent acting that did it in, so I'm going to have to blame the screwup on the guys who thought it would be a great idea to market this movie as a horror when it so clearly isn't. The movie is more of a teen popcorn flick/horror comedy, and it works well. The storyline, while simple, will initially keep you guessing and provides some great opportunities for the actors to show off their acting chops--yes, this even applies to Megan Fox. She gets a bad rap also (I don't know why, I haven't seen her in anything else) but she is great here. None of the characters here are one dimensional besides the side characters who are included to farther ground this story into the land of highschool stereotypes, but it never stays in this territory for too long and soon enough you'll actually feel genuinely bad for these characters. If you walk into this movie expecting a horror you're going to be sorely disappointed. However, if you go into it with an open mind, prepare yourself for some laughs, some tongue in cheek gore, and characters that have heart, you're really going to enjoy this underrated little flick.",

Admittedly, they could have found someone hotter than Megan Fox to play Jennifer considering the attention she drew both in and out of the movie, but I most certainly am not complaining about her looks at all. As for the movie itself, the plot is basically a hodgepodge of horror cliches, teenage stereotypes,  and  genuine WTF moments all spliced together surprisingly well. What I like most about the plot, however, is just how well the actors pull off what might be the most genuine worst case horror scenario ever played out. I won't spoil too much, but the heroine's reluctance (due to her relationship with the monster) to do what needs to be done plays out just long enough for you to empathize with her, but vanishes the very instant it starts to get annoying. The monster is also much more intelligent than most other horror predators. She carefully picks her victims (the insecure, shaken, or the egomaniacal), only attacks when she's absolutely sure she can make a clean getaway, and spaces out her killings to avoid unnecessary attention. This is what should be mainstream in horror movies; intelligence is the scariest thing you can face, and blind vengeance is the best weapon to fight it with. That being said, there are some issues I had with the movie. The first is the dialogue; some of the lines range from cheest at best to outright horrible at worst. Also, though I told you earlier that both heroine and monster are more intelligent than other horror stereotypes, there are some crazy WTF moments. The most obvious is when heroine and monster meet face to face for the first time. Again, I won't spoil much, but black vomit is involved, yet the heroine, either through denial or ignorance, pretends nothing is wrong for as long as she absolutely can, despite her best friend's life being at stake. Their next private encounter is supposed to be sexy (and you'll see why if you watch the movie), but I was on the edge of my seat just waiting for one of them to strike at the other. Nothing. When the encounter ended, I had to pause it for a second to wonder why that scene was shown at all. It just seemed like fluff since literally nothing said or done in it had any impact on the story. I know, it sounds like whining, but it's just an example; let's not even talk about the heroine and her boyfriend's relationship; I only have 2536 characters left. Long story short, this movie is definitely a step in the right direction for horror and horror comedy movies in general, and despite the actor's shortcomings, they definitely come off as human. The small town setting makes the perfect glue to hold it all together, and the simple fact that both monster and heroine actually think, feel, and react make the whole premise that much more real, and that much better.",

      "text": "I'll admit it, Jennifer's Body is a bit of a guilty pleasure. There are plenty of reasons to hate it - Diablo Cody's usually cracking dialogue sounds a bit creaky and forced, and incorporates some cringe-inducingly crude teen slang creations. It's also got a pretty weak first act and an unnecessarily long run-time. Meagon Fox has found her ideal role as a possessed cheerleader, a role where she is actually required to act lifeless, and as per usual entire scenes are built around her sex appeal. It's lucky really that Jennifer Check (Fox) isn't the protagonist, and that job falls to the far more talented Amanda Seyfried, who's character \"Needy\" Lesnicki is much more interesting than Jennifer anyway. The film also owes an awful lot to older, better films (Carrie and almost everything made by Wes Craven spring to mind), in fact I really don't think there's much at all that hasn't been recycled from another source. What Jennifer's Body does have is one of the most entertaining and over-the-top finales in the history of teen movies, plenty of laughs (both intentional and unintentional), bucket-loads of gore, and a general feeling that it's not taking itself too seriously. The film's choice of antagonists is also pleasingly original, and equally scary and funny, and the scene where they cause Jennifer's possession is easily the best in the film. So it'll never be considered a classic of the comedy or horror genre, and considering its numerous flaws, it really doesn't deserve to be, but Jennifer's Body is still more often than not undeniably enjoyable in its trashiness.",
