Unfortunately, I am a little girl and while this director lengthy resume with visual effects clearly shows it also shows that he doesn\u2019t know much else. This is a first time director whose mainly done visuals all his life, which is reflected in his failure to tell a good story. The film starts telling a story about two good characters and it seems like we will get the interesting motivations for Maleficent being evil or a misunderstood villain but instead the film just switches the moralities leaving me wondering if the King will get his own movie where he is shown in better light. I didn\u2019t expect much from this movie but I never thought I\u2019d get writing this atrocious with poorly written characters, an incoherent story, and an experience that makes me want to prick my finger on the spinning wheel and die.

This is a brave and true tale, told with stunningly beautiful direction by Stromberg, an ingenious script by Woolverton and timeless, flawless performances by Jolie and Fanning.  Reading most of the \"negative\" reviews of this film, it's pretty clear that many people 1) simply did not grasp the subtle philosophical messages of this film and 2) want to keep their \"fairy tale\" characters either black (evil) or white (good).  But telling those simplistic tales to our children does not prepare them for the complexity of the real world.

I guess they're supposed to be some sort of comic relief but they just obnoxious and get way too much screen time.

I knew that if any actress could pull off the Disney villain Maleficent, it was none other than Angelina Jolie, an all-time favorite of mine. But I cannot deny the fact that the things that made this a Disney movie is pretty much what ended up strangling it. I liked the angle of her being a fairy who isn't sure about humans but tries to connect and even love them and is betrayed in a gruesome fashion. The film seemed solid until she started to seem quite a bit softer than would be consistent for a dark fairy/witch who threatens an entire kingdom of people. It's not that she could have been more sadistic but more like all the other characters could have been smarter, like all of them. Everyone who wasn't Maleficent was either crazy or pin headed. Except maybe her helper crow. But that sort of made it an environment where she had to do everything for everyone like the nanny, kind of a weak approach for a character with such a strong presence. Meaning she needed a stronger antagonist, Sharlto Copley didn't deliver for me. Just came off a little too insane. The story just got too predictable and cliche' to stay intriguing. The visuals did not disappoint though and who can't help but love Angelina's portrayal of a famous villain. A different story all together may have proven better for her character. I mean, if everyone tells the story claiming that's how IT REALLY HAPPENED, i mean who actually knows how it really happened then? How many stories do you need to bleed dry Disney?",

Certainly one of the most unique and interesting Disney movies yet. I would recommend it to anyone! 10/10 for sure.",

The audience I was sitting in at some all just let out a collective laugh (I think it was when she started floating people through the air), and after that it just went downhill, with people openly commenting on the nonsensical plot elements and heckling the characters on screen.  Basically it takes elements of more successful movies (Lord of the Rings, Frozen, Beauty and the Beast, etc) and tries to replicate their successful parts in a movie that adds very little to the story of Sleeping Beauty.

Parts of the film echoes parts of Wicked and Frozen. I start to wonder if I'm ever going to trust remakes again.

This version benefits from a refreshing twist in the story's telling and an inspired casting choice in Angelina Jolie to play the malevolent titular character. Eschewing the campy humour that essentially ruined 'Mirror Mirror' and balancing its dark tone much more successfully than 'Snow White and the Huntsman', this latest fairy tale adaptation hits most of the right notes. The film looks great and the visual effects can take their place amongst the year's best. James Newton Howard's score never pauses for breath, but delivers everything that we have come to expect of his lush and sweepingly epic music. Also the narration that accompanies the story is strong and complimentary to the overall style. It's only really the temptation to resort to cutesy humour, as when the three tiny fairies become peasant women, that threatens to topple the film in to the realms of pantomime. Otherwise it's surprisingly good!",

But I'm glad I was wrong, for I'm sure only by watching the whole movie can we truly appreciate and understand the very convincing back story and development the character was subject to. Need I mention the perfect casting of Angelina Jolie, Maleficent truly comes to life in full form by Angelina's stunning skills and presence. A twist that's not clich\u00e9, sentiments that are deep, humor that's ever so natural and action that always keeps you at the edge of your seat! Maleficent in this movie is not exactly as we know of her from the few minutes we got to see her in the original movie, but let me tell you she's every bit deliciously evil. It was amusing to see Angelina play a role that requires a lot of nuances to pull of this character with a lot of depth as opposed to the one-dimensional character from the movie. Never letting off the grip, she carried the movie on her shoulders. Nothing to take away from the beauty of the rest of the movie which takes breath with excellent direction and visual effects that will truly transport you to another world, and the amazing work by all the 'supporting' actors. Yes, the other characters weren't as fleshed out as Maleficent, but I see that as good thing, given the title and theme. A spectacular balance. I'd also like to bring light on the enchanting score, thanks to James Newton Howard, this maestro is underrated.",

We meet Stephen shortly afterwards. Maleficent falls in love with him because the narrator says so. However, Stephen is \"ambitious\" because the narrator says so. Stephen leaves Maleficent behind. She is sad because the narrator says so... The narrator eventually eases off halfway through the film. This is a poor way to impart exposition to the audience in a film, and the rest of the narrative is unfortunately weak due to further poor characterization of the antagonist and supporting characters. Jolie's performance as Maleficent saves her character somewhat. I DID like the feminist message at the end, clumsily executed as it was. Ultimately, this film suffers from very basic narrative and character deficiencies resulting from poor exposition and cliche overuse. This film is not necessarily terrible, but one should not expect to find a profound feminist narrative here.",

It was visually stunning, and the faerie creatures were convincing and creative, but that's far down on my list of what makes a movie great in this day of increasingly impressive CGI.  What I want is story, character development, acting, and good writing, and Maleficent delivers in a big way.  Jolie was simply amazing in claiming this role.  I hear they had to cast her daughter to fill the toddler scene because the other kids were too scared of her to perform.  That's easy to believe.  Maleficent simply radiates fear, power, and her need for vengeance as she seeks to revenge herself on her tormentor's child.  She appears heartless, referring to the Aurora as a beastie, and seemingly roots for her death, at least when others are obviously watching.  She is utterly 'maleficent,' or so she wants everyone to think.  This movie exposes how poorly written Disney tales have always been and unlike the original sleeping beauty, feels like an actual enchantment and is presented as pure poetry.  As a 43-year-old man, I didn't expect it to work on me, but like Maleficent herself, I found myself relent the deeper into the film I got.  Simply a stupendous film.",

This film is great. I didn't think I would like it. I didn't rush to the cinema to see it. But having had it play in the background constantly I have found myself getting drawn in. It is beautiful, enchanting, funny and scary (for the little ones at least). Each time I've watched it I have seen something new.",

I did, however, enjoy the evil presence of the ever so powerful Maleficent, thinking she could just be one of the best Disney villains of all time, you would think that making a movie about her would be interesting, especially with Oscar winner Angelina Jolie in the title role.",

But what I loved the most about the movie was the villain, Maleficent. She was so creepy and evil, it was awesome! So when I heard Disney was going to make a live action adaptation of Sleeping Beauty focused completely on Maleficent, I was excited. But my god was I wrong! For one, they make Maleficent good. That is such a bad idea and the worst part is they want us to simpithize with her! Uh, hello you realize she cursed and infant baby right? Speeking of which, Aurora is really bland in this movie. And don't even get me started on Prince Philip, he's pretty much useless in this film. King Stefen is probably the most forgettable Disney villains ever. The three fairies, WHAT THE HECK!!! They turned them into Three Stooges",

      "text": "This started out to be promising, but by the end it just became worse and worse. Retelling the story from the villain's point of view could have worked if only she had stayed a villain and the characters had acted reasonably, but nothing made any sense.  Maleficent wanted revenge and she could have killed the young princess a hundred times yet she did not. The father didn't need to send his daughter away, especially not with 3 so incompetent women. He also didn't  react realistically when he was reunited with his daughter considering that he was so crazy because he loved her so much and tried to protect her.  I expected that the \"true love's kiss\" in the end is gonna be a twist and it could have worked if only it was Diaval who kissed her, because it was built up, from the very beginning it seemed like he cared about the princess. If maleficent remained a villain as she is supposed to be, it would have been nice to see that the bird/guy she tormented turns against her, ruin her evil plan and two person who suffered Maleficent's cruelty end up together. Instead, this \"twist\"  is plain dumb, the king became completely evil for no logical reason, the villain became nice again for no logical reason... etc. Meh..everything is dumb in this movie.",

I'll probably give it a another look in about 5 years or so..",
