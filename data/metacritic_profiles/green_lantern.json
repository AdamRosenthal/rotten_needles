I was hoping for a good eye popping visual feast with a cast that didn't disappoint. Well it was a good as I hoped. The acting avoided the cheesiness that sometimes plagues films like this. I was pleasantly surprised that during the relatively lighthearted moments (read: not dark like Batman) it still maintained seriousness and the characters never crossed the line on believability with overacting. By comparison this movie was better than THOR in my opinion. The only thing I can critique is that it was a little short. They could have added about 20 minutes to flesh out the character development a bit more, but overall it still worked pretty well. I thought Ryan Reynolds did a good job. His character seemed like an unassuming approachable guy that got chucked into this role of responsibility, but had the raw potential to be a hero under the right circumstances. It was believable in a similar way as Peter Parker in Spiderman, but more so because Hal wasn't a dork to start ou with. Heck in costume Reynolds even looks like Lantern in the comics. I think he was a good choice ultimately. I can't wait for the sequel. If you were lucky enough and stayed for the closing credits you had a chance to see Sinestro put that yellow ring of fear on and bask in it's evil. Smells like sequel materiL to me. Can't wait..",

So if your intention is to watch a movie that'll make you feel warm and fuzzy, or make you cry, or make you ponder the nature of life, don't see this. What this movie is, is an exceptional representation of an iconic superhero, which is a rarity today. I had initial concerns about Ryan Reynolds playing Hal Jordan as he's a very quirky actor, but he pulled it off well. Carol Ferris wasn't as well played, but she was still passable. What really struck me about this movie was how it really stayed true to the origin of the green lantern and yet at the same time dumbed it down for casual audiences. As a for instance, those of you who have read the comics know that Parallax's backstory is long and complicated and one can't really understand it without understanding the war of light, but the movie makes a few minor changes and makes him an acceptable villain to someone who hasn't followed the comics. This is getting a little long-winded, but what it boils down to is Green Lantern is DC's Iron Man: A healthy amount of action, true to the origin, accessible by both long-term fans and casual viewers, and not too much cheesy crap.",

With the huge depth of super heroes from DC unvierse to make movies on i thought that this movie would be one of the best movies out there this year. Oh how wrong was I. Even for me a true fan of the GL, this movie is utter rubbish. Its really boring, takes forever to get going and when it does it ends. It feels more like a setup for a second movie (at the end you will see why) but given how much it has flopped unless they know the 2nd movie will be a million times better than this, no one would go near it with a barge pole. The acting is okay in my opinon, Ryan Reynolds does a good job as the GL but his supporting cast look like they couldnt care less. The Special effects are good when you get to see some action but its not enough. If you are not gonna have action scenes then at least replace them with an engaging story, Unfortnately it dosent, stay away from this title its very, very poor.",

Other than the presence of Paralax, 90% of the Hal Jordan origin story reflects what you find in GL: Secret Origin (by Geoff Johns), which keeps this from becoming just another cringe worthy attempt to cash in on the wave of superhero films since the late 90's. That being said it isn't Shakespeare, so if you're looking for a heady drama you're not going to find it here.

Is it any wonder then that the content seems a bit rushed or compressed? I think not, yet consider it a foundation movie. Okay, many DC Hal Jordan fans will probably not appreciate some of Hal's ring constructs. Hal never used complicated machinery like mini-guns or Anti Aircraft guns, but at least they kept to the more contemporary treatment of overcoming fear rather than the original fearless concept, definitely more believable! The more missing bits for me were more the camaraderie of the Corps, they have always been something like the Musketeers, all for one and one for all. Still they did come save Hal from burning up in the sun, too little too late for me personally. If you are not a rigid fan of the comics you can appreciate the struggles of the Hal Jordan that suddenly and very unexpectedly is handed over such power. You can even root for him as an underdog against the somewhat condescending alien species who look down on the young emotional humans. But they got one thing right, though often doubting, Hal never gives up and fights for his friends, the world, and yes also the universe. Sinestro, Kilowog, Tomar Re, and Abin Sur were well portrayed and most comic book fans would appreciate that but have wanted to see more. The final scene was classic Sinestro and well positions the sequel in what could become a great franchise if they don't try to cover so much in the next movie. 53 million the opening weekend may make the sequel a reality and if so they need to have a stronger plot, more Corps camaraderie and more character interaction between Corp members that somehow manage to unite in purpose despite such diversity.",

Everything felt rushed; some actually good scenes were cut off too quickly, the final battle came far too fast, and the whole movie I was hoping that one character would stand out and become defined, but alas, they never did.

Spend some time on the writing, put aside the egos and let the writers who have talent and are fans of the subject weave the reasons for that love into the story.  There are thousands of superhero stories out there and most of them are rightfully forgotten, so the few that stand the test of time have something that has been speaking to people for generations.  Find that truth and make it the foundation of every thing the story communicates.  And THEN make it look really cool.  Also, yes there is subtext, but these are also comics not Shakespeare, so you don't have to bury that too deep.

It makes for an excellent eye-candy piece, especially if you buy it on blu-ray. However, as a faithful interpretation of the Green Lantern lore, I found the movie to be merely okay. The director obviously knew where the characters are generally going to end up. The teaser at the end is very accurate of the character's (Sinestro) fate. However, the movie focuses too much on the character of Hal Jordan and not enough on any of the other green lantern corps members. We never truly get into Sinestro's head or realize what a brute badass Kilowog really is. Overall, I thought Green Lantern First Flight was a far more enjoyable origin story for Green Lantern, even though it is animated. I think 10-20 years down the line when they make a new Green Lantern, (assuming this one does not receive a sequel) this version will be the equivalent to tim burton's Batman being compared to chis nolan's Batman Begins.",

Actually, this film kind of reminded me of Thor in how the different worlds are presented (theirs more colorful compared to our earthy pallet). Its villain (Peter Sarsgaard) was a little underused which is a shame because his performance was quite creepy. Angela Basset was good but criminally underused while tim Robins was snarky and suave.

There are sympathetic feelings going both ways before things get perverted. What's more, while it's a little cheesy, the will vs. fear conflict is very Romantic. The physical manifestation of the human feelings is something that Nathaniel Hawthorne likely would have found interesting. I enjoyed it. Blake Lively wasn't as bad as many in my theater would argue, but there wasn't enough chemistry between her and Reynolds. Yes, they are exes and mere colleagues now; However, there is more heat between cop partners on TV procedurals than there is here.

Initial trailers and previews had looked uniformly uninspiring at best.  Also, the choices of Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively for the film were areas of some concern to many fans of the original comic source material, who doubted whether either performer would be capable of projecting the level of depth and gravity that appeals to modern comic fans familiar with the revised and modernized source material largely created by the film's Co-Producer, Geoff Johns. Finally seeing the film in 3D at my local theater, I was pleased to see that many of my concerns were either unfounded or overwrought. Reynolds and Lively both delivered adequate performances, though at times both suffered from a bad case of \"I'm reading my script now, and it says to say this line with emotion!\"-itis. The film's computer generated graphics were largely competent, with a few stop-motion style artifacts in some scenes that were likely exaggerated by the 3D process.   As fans had actually suspected from early in the process, Mark Strong's performance as Corps member Sinestro was a particularly bright spot in a film that needed them.  On the other end of the spectrum, Peter Saarsgard does his best to channel John Malkovich, turning in a performance just so over-the-top as to fit in right at home in a movie based on comic books. Unfortunately, it's difficult to tell whether the problem with Saarsgard's Hector Hammond is with his portrayal, or the writing his character endures. Angela Bassett turns in an excellent performance as Amanda Waller, who seems to be given a far smaller role than the history and depth of her character's comic incarnation but almost seems to be there in order to offer a way to tie in further characters and background with other possible sequels or connected films.",

I actuallyy fell asleep a couple of times during this movie, although i was tired and i saw the midnight showing, but the movie was pretty boring at times. If they do make a sequel i suggest they make it more epic like every comic book film should be. Create a stronger story, more action and certainly make the climax extended and epic, because the ending to this film as well with the whole movie, was awfully rushed. Overall the acting was sub par, not nearlyenough action, whole film was rushed but i give it a 4 because the comedy was definite,y there and Blake Lively is super hot in this movie. 4/10",

Somewhere around the twenty-minute mark, I actually thought, \"I wonder what all the negativity is about; this is actually pretty entertaining.\" What followed soon after that thought extinguished my feeling of hope.. The worst scenes are the ones that involve the romance between Hal & Carol Farris as the majority fall flat & are even cringe-inducing at times. One scene is especially bad & I couldn't help but think, \"What is this, 'Top Gun'?\" Although Carol is an important part of the Green Lantern mythology, it feels like much of her relationship with Hal is shoehorned into the film in order to draw a more varied audience.. However, my biggest problem with the movie is not the romance, but how little time is spent away from Earth. In my opinion, the off-world scenes are the most enjoyable parts of the movie, but they feel squandered amongst the rest of the film. Without spoiling anything, a lot of the plot-lines feel incomplete, while the amalgamation of important chapters of the comic book mythology feels like a wasted opportunity to paint a bigger picture of the Green Lantern universe that could have easily been expanded in sequels stemming directly from concepts introduced in this movie. Example: I can't help but wonder what purpose, if any, Angela Bassett's character will serve as her role in the comic book world is an important one; maybe she'll be the Nick Fury of DC movies..? Casting: Besides a few good moments, Ryan Reynolds just did not fit as Hal Jordan. If he were playing Booster Gold, I'd be singing a different tune.. As for the rest of the cast, Mark Strong is excellent as Sinestro & Peter Sarsgaard is very effective as Hector Hammond.

The actors are also good in the vast majority - Ryan Reynolds is effortlessly likeable as our titular hero, and Mark Strong is as good as he always is as the fantastically morally complex Sinestro. The action is also extremely well-handled, with director Martin Campbell proving himself to be just as competent at handling special effects-driven filmic spectacle as with the practicall (as he demonstrated in Goldeneye and Casino Royale). The film fails in main because of its exceedingly daft source material. The Green Lantern comics were stupid even by super hero standards, and it would be nigh-on impossible for even the most accomplished director to bring this universe to the big screen with a completely straight face. Luckily, Campbell doesn't take things too seriously, and this results in one of the film's most pleasing moments, when love interest Carol Ferris (Blake Lively) comments on the ridiculousness of people not guessing Green Lantern's identity simply because they \"can't see his cheekbones\". Even this self-awareness can't save the film as a whole - the ideas behind this stupid universe aren't consistent or fully developed, and visual creativity doesn't stop Green Lantern from being ridiculous. The acting talent of such masters as Tim Robbins is almost completely wasted, and his relationship with estranged son Hector Hammond (Peter Sarsgaard) is woefully under-developed. Despite these obvious failings, Green Lantern remains an entertaining diversion, and a decent, if fairly hollow super hero film. Perhaps if a sequel is made, this intriguing intergalactic cop can truly step into the light...",

It's 1984, and Alex Rogan is going for the Starfighter record, blasting spaceships on a coin-operated video game in pursuit of a million points before a live audience. When he crosses the threshold, you know the record is legitimate because Alex breaks the mark on a sanctioned machine, which makes all the difference in the world, according to Billy Mitchell, who discredits the world record-breaking Donkey Kong score posted by Washington resident Steve Wiebe in \"The King of Kong\", the 2007 documentary about the subculture of competitive gaming. 874,300 and 1,006,600 are meaningless numbers, relevant only to an insular group of eighties refugees, but in \"The Last Starfighter\", the score matters; it's actually a world record, tied with other players, extra-terrestrials from distant galaxies who presumably are all smarter than Alex, which proves Twin Galaxies referee Walter Day right with his claim that first generation arcade games require \"comprehensive thinking\". Whereas Wiebe, a middle-school science teacher, drives cross-country to New Hampshire for a winner-take-all showdown with Mitchell, a chicken wing hot sauce tycoon, Alex's journey takes him to the stars, as he's transported across the universe by Centauri, an interplanetary recruiter for Rylos, the planet where Alex, a jack-of-all-trades(including plumber, just like Mario), is expected to defend the Kodan Armada from Xur. It's the video game's premise come to life; it's a ten-year-old kid's wet dream, but Alex's brother is too busy ogling centerfolds from his Playboy stash. Early on, \"The Last Starfighter\" recognized the potential for arrested development in video game-playing males. Exhibit A: the \"boys\" at Fun Spot whose lives are centered around a Donkey Kong champion, twenty-three years after the film last played in theaters. This should be Louis' adventure. Released one year after Dragon's Lair(the first role-playing coin-op), the \"Star Wars\" knockoff demonstrates how anything could be an avatar, be it an interstellar fighter pilot or an Italian-American plumber-turned-\"Average Joe\" superhero, and more importantly, shows how the movies would someday resemble video games, in which \"The Green Lantern\" is just one more spectacle-laden example. In essence, Hal Jordan flies his plane like a gamer, breaking the rules of engagement like Maverick in \"Top Gun\", but Cruise managed to be human, unlike the superhero, who is clearly a cipher. The ring chooses Hal by default, since earth just happens to be the planet that Abin Sur crashes on. Earth has no affiliation with the Green Lantern Corps., whose leader deems the human species worthy only of his contempt. Alex, likewise, is considered to be a fluke. Centauri explains how the machine was originally headed for Vegas, but inexplicably, it turned up at a \"fleaspeck trailer park\", completely incongruous to its natural surroundings, an arcade, just like how the monolith in \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" winds up in the African desert, causing a disturbance among the apes(Donkey Kong, a gorilla, is a kind of ape). Earth isn't even a part of the league. Humans are comparably stupid. However, similar to how the monolith instilled that first ape with the intelligence to use the bone as a weapon, the machine makes Alex smarter, bringing him up to speed in order to make him competitive with the higher-evolved recruits. Like \"The Last Starfighter\", this latest DC Comics adaptation features a loss of narrative momentum, in which both protagonists return home when earth doesn't seem to be in any imminent danger. \"Save the whales, but not the universe,\" observes Alex's replicant when the humanoid first sees the conscientious objector. Like the would-be starfighter, Hal is also an isolationist; he doesn't see how the Parallax's rampage against the planets of his Green Lantern brethren affects earth. Cowards at heart, nevertheless, self-preservation keeps both Hal and Alex alive and enables them to save their home when it comes under attack. At Alex's orientation for the Rylan Star League, the \"death or victory\" chant that comes at the end of the speaker's closing statements recall the Japanese mentality during WWII, turning the starfighter recruits into something akin to kamikaze pilots. Alex, being American, is impervious to the brainwashing. Similarly, the Parallax possesses the same quintessential war period Japanese characteristic of fearlessness, as embodied by the fear essence's \"yellow\" energy. It's Hal's humanity; his admission of being afraid to die which makes him successful against the Parallax and Hector, whose bulbous head, a result of exposure to radiation, could be interpreted as a reference to the atomic bombs that leveled Japan. Donkey Kong is suicide too. Most games \"don't last a minute\". It's suicide, manufactured by Nintendo.",

In fact, it does something that no other comic book movie has done yet this year. It takes its time introducing the characters. This was the first movie where I didn't feel like I was being rushed along from one plot point to the next. Before getting into the main story, we learn that Hal Jordan (Ryan Reynolds) is a brash fighter pilot who has the potential to be something greater, and that his friendship with the beautiful Carol Ferris (Blake Lively) is a complicated one. In short, the screenwriters do a nice job of laying the foundation to potentially expand the depth of the characters as the movie progresses. But the problem that arises is that the writers don't do anything more past that point. They fail to take any of the characters in interesting directions. Sure, the characters change as they are supposed to, but every choice that's made is something we've seen in other films. The action is filmed well, but the action scenes themselves don't do anything to lift you out of your seat. This leaves us with only the storyline to rely upon. And what a lame storyline it is. Apparently in the universe, there's green energy which is a manifestation of willpower and yellow energy which encompasses fear. Also, floating around in the universe is a giant octopus with a computer animated face named Parallax. The mythology of \"Green Lantern\" is hokey, and when there's nothing else to suck us in (no compelling characters or action set pieces), the mythology sticks out like a really ugly blemish. I feel bad for Ryan Reynolds. He really does all he can with the role, and he shows that he can be a competent leading man. But the problem is that the movie surrounding his performance is so mediocre that he can do nothing to save it. Skip this and wait for a summer movie that brings the excitement.",

It wasn't a failure in execution, but content.  I felt that the acting was enjoyable; nobody seemed tired or tasked to add life the characters.  The scenery and CG were dazzling, and the musical score was spot on (still looking for the \"Green Lantern\" theme though).  Much of the film seemed to skim over things, like characters and plot points, but I'm guessing that the filmmakers were expecting to make a sequel to follow-up on those.  On the whole, the question really becomes \"How do you make a movie about an intergalactic superhero/cop without turning the audience off with disbelief?\"  I could think of a few, but then that wouldn't be critiquing, just making excuses for this film.",

I would have never even considered watching it if I wasn't given it as a joke bithday present from my sister. It's the a silly film in its scenarios and action, but it's super serious with its kinda sucky story line and dialogue.

The effects and CGI for the most part are overdone and look cheap, but on occaisions, they look pretty good  but not impressive by any stretch. Character building/developement is lacking and the relationship between the villian and hero doesn't really develop. The action of the film is silly and cheap, and the film ends quickly and puts a sudden end to the growing climax. The acting, on the otherhand, is okay, not impressive  but good enough.",
