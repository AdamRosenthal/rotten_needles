But you know those rare cases where it is worth an hour of looking bad movie to be presented with a totally wonderful? That's exactly what happens in \"Paper Man.\" The relationship between the characters of Jeff Daniels and Emma Stone (pride) becomes so sincere that transforms the story into a drama full of sensitivity. Just thought a pity that the couple Kieran Mulroney and Michele Mulroney have not demonstrated the necessary skill to develop a better structure of the script.",
