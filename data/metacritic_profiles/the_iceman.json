In 1992, The Iceman granted HBO an exclusive interview, where he talked about his life and described his crimes, the way someone would describe their job. This film is the dramatization of Kuklinski's story, based entirely on what he said during his interview. Boardwalk Empire's Michael Shannon stars as Kuklinski and was absolutely the perfect choice to play him. Some actors, even ones like Shannon,  seem to be destine to play certain characters, it's how they make a name for themselves. Shannon is often knocked for being too cold and emotionless in his other roles, so he was essentially the perfect choice to play the Iceman. Shannon is paired with Winona Ryder and all these years later, she still manages to annoy the hell out of me. I really don't get what people see in her. The cast of this film is rounded out by some terrific cameos, by the likes of Ray Liotta, James Franco, and David Schwimmer, all of whom are terrific and add to the mystique of this film. I really did enjoy this film, but it is confusing and somewhat slow at times, slower than you wouldn't expect a film about a mafia hit-man to be. This films throws so many names at you and jumps from scene to scene and time to time so quickly, that it is a little difficult to keep track of who's who. Other than that, the performances are terrific and it's amazing how they were able to piece together a film from a simple interview, definitely worth checking out.",

Aside from an awkward performance from David Schwimmer, The Iceman features a somewhat memorable portrayal of Kuklinski from Michael Shannon.",

You get to judge whether Kuklinski really loved his family and did all the killings so he could support them or if he was simple always going to be a killer.",

      "text": "Overall, it is hard to not characterize this one as a minor disappointment. I wanted to love this one so much, but just cannot. I mean, Michael Shannon absolutely kills (heh) it in the lead role and the rest of the cast is full of big names and great performances from Winona Ryder, Ray Liotta, Chris Evans, and David Schwimmer. It had all of the elements that should make this one great, but beyond the acting, it was very underwhelming. The film felt very ambitious, but in the ambition, it very much fell short. The script is eh at best and the film, as a whole feels very, very brief. The story is very interesting and, as I just said, the performances were great, but the film feels better suited for a television series than a movie. There is a lot of depth here, but the film just sort of covers the surface and fails to properly develop all of Kuklinski's relationships. As a film, it is nothing more than ok with great performances. If this were a television series (with a better script), it could have made for some fantastic television.",

Wynona Ryder can still act and the ice cream killer may be Chris Evans best work.  Not perfect but close to depicting the dual life that the iceman somehow pulled off for so long.  I actually saw the documentary years ago and it is almost as entertaining as the actual interview with Kuklinski.  Highly recommended.",

Claiming to have pulled off over one hundred hits to his name, Richard Kuklinski was a legendary mafia contract killer known for his intimidating stature, and his cold-hearted, nonchalant approach to his craft. \"The Iceman,\" based on a true story, is a fairly standard biopic that is only exalted beyond mediocrity by an imposing performance from Michael Shannon. Shannon's commanding performance is clearly the centerpiece of the movie, as he effortlessly exudes a cold-hearted confidence as a genuine, psychopathic hitman.",
