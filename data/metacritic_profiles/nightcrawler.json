While driving home after trying the sell the fence and a few other things to a scrapyard Louis stumbles upon a wreckage on the highway and notices two guys filming cops trying to save a woman from a burning car and by the look on his face you can just see him fall in love it. From here we see Louis go from a no name guy with a cheap camcorder recording graphic news stories to one of the best in the game with his own company, a new ride with tons of high-tech equipment, and a assistant. All is not so great though and we see just the lengths Louis will go to become the best in the business even if that means lying to the police.

Nightcrawler is a very exciting movie, full of intense action scenes.  It's also a very stylish looking film.  It uses neon and shadows in much of the way Drive did, but not quite to that movie's vibrant extant.  There are some surprising turns, the story is involving, and the satire is sharp, but I also felt that in the end it didn't have enough weight to it.  It's memorable, but something about it is fairly distant, and unattainable.  You'd never guess that it's a small budget indie film though.  It has all the polish of a major Hollywood blockbuster.

The film is bolstered by Gyllenhaal's performance which is electrifying, unpredictable and extraordinary. I'm holding out hope for an Oscar nomination, even if his superb work in recent years (i.e. Zodiac, Prisoners) has gone unrecognised by the Academy. His work here is more than deserving to buck the trend - I was left hanging on every word that came out of his mouth, dripping in guile and insanity. He's backed up by a strong supporting cast. Rene Russo stands out as the station manager who becomes Louis's biggest client for his footage. Her work is similarly Oscar-calibre and she shows her character's insecurities and vulnerabilities with subtlety and grace, doing a particularly good job of showing simultaneously the shock at Louis's moral decline and her dependence at the rejuvenation his footage is giving her career. Dan Gilroy's alternately disturbing and exciting and surprisingly funny (in parts) script deftly handles its character's amorality and the exploration of the way media and crime are becoming closely intertwined.",

Louis Bloom (Gyllenhaal) is down on his luck, he drives an old car, lives in an disgusting apartment, and doesn't have a job. He drives around at night looking for ways to earn money, when he comes across a film crew taping a crime scene. It seems like easy money, so Bloom goes out, gets a camera, and starts filming the police himself, only, he doesn't follow the same rules that the others do. I will not dispute that Gyllenhaal was terrific, but his character was beyond annoying. Louis Bloom is this O.C.D. guy, who is constantly rambling and talking to himself, something that basically ruins the whole film. This guy gets so annoying it's to the point of frustrating. On top of that, it takes a long time for anything substantial to happen. I was really looking forward to seeing this film and was impressed by how far Jake Gyllenhaal has come, but despite it's looming cult classic label, I found this film to just be one frustrating scene after another. Critics are willing to give films like this four stars and tell you it's a must see, because of an Oscar worthy performance, but what's really the point of seeing something that most people aren't going to want to sit through? Similar to Citizen Kane, it's got a great reputation, but don't let that fool you, this is one of the most nerve racking films I've ever sat through and to be honest, I'm sorry I did.",

      "text": "Two intoxicated old newsmen, a producer and the anchorman he just fired, in Network, nurse their last drinks at the bar, commiserating over the slipping standards of broadcast journalism. As a riposte to Howard Beale's avowal of an on-air suicide, in jest, the UBS news division head envisions The Death Hour, a weekly series whose content is wholly violent, wholly sensational. \"Suicides, assassinations, automobile smashups,\" Max jokingly brainstorms, never dreaming that his drunken ramblings outlining a telecast of blood-soaked spectacle would one day turn out to be an uncanny bit of prophetic extrapolation, a bar-lowering that allows somebody like Louis Bloom, a freelancing videographer, to be an invaluable media cog. Louis' bosses are death merchants, ratings-driven professionals who fulfill the UBS producer's longago pitch for a \"great Sunday night show for the whole family.\" Nightcrawler can be seen as the third film in an unofficial trilogy about the dumbing down of the news, the unassailable culmination of Beale's rant to the studio audience that television had supplanted books and newspapers as the primary medium of intellectual discourse. The penultimate film, Broadcast News, released a decade after Network, screenwriter Paddy Chayefsky's divination that entertainment value would eventually encroach on the erudite nature of hard news proved to be true, finds encapsulation in the scene where Jane Craig, a Washington bureau producer, sounds the alarm on broadcast news content when she presents a domino demonstration clip at a conference for local reporters. Whereas, in Network, the studio audience watching a degraded version of the news was the hoi polloi, denizens raised on Bugs Bunny, therefore rankling the old vanguard who still controlled the medium, in Broadcast News, we can see, quite pointedly, how the generation gap closed during the interim between both films. The Bugs Bunny aficionados were now the gatekeepers, industry insiders, who, to Jane's disappointment, are not \"mad as hell\" about the infiltration of fluff bombarding the airwaves, when the seminar attendees clap in approval after the final domino falls. At this juncture, the late-eighties, it would seem by the light-hearted genre(the rom-com) that is chosen to document the news program's fluid aspect in filmic amber, networks and their affiliates were, as of yet, not the whorehouses that Frank Hackett had purported UBS to be. Broadcast News ends on an optimistic note, a note suggesting that the trend could still be reversed. Tom Grunick, newly minted as the face of the news division, at his press conference, defers the programming duties to a civic-minded heavyweight. This conceit, in which a narcissist like the telegenic, yet uninformed newsman would be an advocate for hard copy that matters, now, in retrospect, seems more absurd than an anchorman being assassinated by network honchos because of low ratings. Tom is all about style over substance. Jane Craig doesn't exist anymore. Diana Christensen does. Once thought to be an implausible invention of a scribe with an overheated imagination, the bloodthirsty woman behind The Mao Tse Tung Hour, the UBS hit show documenting the terroristic maneuvers of the Ecumenical Liberation Army, lives on in Nina Romina, the news editor for a low-rated L.A. morning show, who embodies and widens Diana's vision of broadcast news as spectacle. Chayefsky, who would die in '81, never lived to see the ultra-violent direction that Hollywood would take; he never saw the big-budgeted studio films with high body counts, the count so high, audiences would become desensitized to the human collateral damage. In Bad Boys 2, neither we nor the filmmaker, in a chase scene between off-road vehicles, stop to consider the welfare of the Haitian peasants as the Hummer and Range Rover plow through their tarpaper shanties. Nightcrawler satirizes a different generation, The Terminator Generation, raised on the \"event movie\". Better than Man Bites Dog, the psuedo-doc about a film crew who follows a serial killer at work, Nightcrawler gets its message across about audience complicity towards violence because unlike the grainy B/W, cinema verite style of the Belgian import, the filmmaker uses the film language of the Hollywood blockbuster. Situated outside a glass-walled Chinese restaurant, Louis records a furious exchange of gunfire between the police and the suspects of a home invasion. The rectangular glass front, meant to represent a movie screen, provides a clue as to why people tune into the graphic imagery that apparently turns up on local mornings news shows in big cities. It's entertainment. It's The Death Hour. When Ben, in Man Bites Dog, murders an entire family in their home, we're horrified because it looks real. Here, violence, looks fun behind Louis' camera eye. Innocent bystanders die in the shootout, but we don't care. We've seen it in the movies.",

However, to me, one of the films best features was the cinematography, in particular the lighting. In line with other great films that capture Los Angeles at night such as Drive and Collateral, Nightcrawler is beautifully shot and lit. Another major plus for this one would have to be the way it operates as a biting criticism of the television news industry. Showing them as morally questionable and willing to do anything for ratings, this one certainly shows the shady side of television and raises many questions that should be answered, such as the morality of showing some of the footage shown. Overall, Nightcrawler is a thrilling, intense, and very creepy, experience that should help propel both Gilroy and Gyllenhaal to further success.",

Nightcrawler is one of those films, but it also entertains greatly with its fantastic performances, outlook on modern media, and a great tone. Elephant in the room time: Jake Gyllenhaal. I've heard buzz lately about Jake's recent outstanding performances. He has surely stepped up his game, and Nightcrawler delivers with another superior performance from him. Here, he plays a sociopath hell-bent on getting all that he wants in his job. He really gives off a creepy, disturbing, and unsettling tone playing this character. I more than look forward to his future movies. Rene Russo is nearly as good as Gyllenhaal. There's an actor here I don't think I've seen before: Riz Ahmed. While he does have some glimpses of very good acting, I think there was lost potential with his role, meaning he could've been better or even easily replaced. I see potential with him, though, I'll give him that. Even though Michael Hyatt's role and appearances were brief, she was incredibly good. The main plot here is that Jake's character works in the LA freelance crime journalism territory. He goes up to crime scenes, films it, and sells the footage to news channel broadcasts. With this, Nightcrawler delves into dark, mature territory at times, which I welcomed. How far Jake's character will go just might astound you. The movie also has it's fair share of jaw-dropping moments. The movie mixes thriller, suspense, and drama to great results. The flaws here aren't too big, but noticeable. The movie sometimes objectifies logic and equals to annoying measures. I also was unsatisfied with the ending and the scene before that final scene. The pacing problems were so, so slight, but it is worth mentioning that the first half's pacing will differ from parts of the second half's, which irritated me at only a few points. Nightcrawler is a great movie, even a bit above great. It just misses my 9 out of 10, SO CLOSE. It may not be in my Top 10 movies of the year, but it will be one I will surely remember.",

This movie has such an excellent character development, having as protagonist this weird, eccentric guy, that, being desperate for a job, muscles into the world of L.A. crime journalism. The film is fantastic, all the acting is very good, but the one from Gillenhaal is just beautiful. He really knows how to give life to his character, and how to make progress all the way through the film. The script is incredible, everything in the movie makes sense, and everything Gillenhaal says is extremely well thought, there isn't anything out of context and the story is very original. The ambient is very realistic, and you will not want to take your eyes out of the screen. The score, not being extremely good, gets its job done. The movie is excellent. I would really like a sequel. Watch it, without doubt.",

But his performance in this movie make me watch it actually i think the movie wasn't something special a normal crime thriller about the television industry concerning a mysterious figure Lou Bloom who is a sociopath bent on success, and he won't let anything or anyone stand in his way to the top.When he sees an opportunity to shape events for mutual benefit within the confides of criminal law he chooses to ignore moral law to achieve his goals.See the movie show us a person who is ready to do anything for his career he move death body's he lie and manipulate he even stalk criminals that's and film a horror crime scene for his selfish reason im saying selfish because the character was selfish.When he was blackmailing Nina Romina (Rene Ruso) he not only wanted money and place in business he want her too not only that think the way that he film all the thing he didn't think about the victims he think about his film about he name and watch every one his films again and again, he even kill his employe for that selfish. And that's the interesting Jake Gyllenhaal fit this role so good that you can't even take eye off the screen in waiting of his next psycho move or idea.That's probably the best role of Gyllenhaalhe is utterly disturbing at one point, hilarious at another, and horrifying at others.You can see that he was work hard for that role and give his best and i think that made the movie so good to watching the performance of one single actor make this movie soo good .",

While Gyllenhaal gives it his all in what some would consider the most compelling performance of his career, I never entirely bought into his character because he was essentially an amalgam of every other brooding, reclusive sociopath in cinema history, and he was all too familiar a character to even remotely pique my interest. Nightcrawler is a film that teeters uncomfortably between being realistic and illogical throughout, with vague social commentary jammed somewhere in between. It seemed like the score was absent for over half the movie's duration, but it flutters in occasionally (and awkwardly, I might add) to remind the audience of its existence. Director Dan Gilroy also demands that the audience revel in the inhumanity depicted on screen, and is so focused upon unsettling the audience, that any message he may be trying to convey is completely diluted by this forced grittiness. This film pales in comparison to Gone Girl in all respects.",
