As nothing happens when the disparate group of guitarists meet, the film is then turned into a by the numbers brief doco on why each member got into music. The result is really dull because there is no unifying theme to the disparate acts. It fails as a love ode to the guitar also and is really an example of a very weak vague idea executed poorly.",
