While God\u2019s Not Dead may not automatically grab your attention as a summer blockbuster, it is good enough to keep your attention unlike the multitude of old Christian B movies out there and shows that this genre really is starting to mature. I really liked the deviation from being a pure philosophical discussion to talking about science and showing how the Bible supports true science, even the Big Bang and Evolution without wasting time alluding to young earth creationist pseudoscientific arguments that so many well-meaning Christians think they need believe in that pseudoscience to be true believers of sacred scripture. If only the pastor of my church, Rock Church in San Diego, would realize this and stick to what the Bible says instead of engaging in spurious young earth creationist arguments and getting himself tied up with personal interpretations of the Bible that the creators of this film have deftly avoided. This is all while creating a film that promotes the core of the Christian message from a scientific viewpoint that engages both physical and spiritual reality for those who believe or are about ready to believe in the one that says no matter what happens in your life and how much you lose, you are not an orphan but a child of God, if you will only believe in me.

Honestly there were points during which I considered this may actually be an atheist propaganda film, the idea being that a film so horrid in defense of God would only have negative backspin. Even from a purely film-based standpoint, the actor is bad, the writing is atrocious, the plot is all over the place. There are scenes so bad I think of Tommy Wiseau's \"The Room\".

Not just that, this movie also have a lot of prejudice against Atheists, It shows EVERY atheist as a total moron with no sense of anything and only living a life to disprove the existence of God. Now talking about the structure, this movie has none, the director uses things that were clich\u00e9 years and years ago and put them in the entire movie, I literally cried while watching this movie for the grotesque thing it is, the acting is ridiculous, I think they got everyone in a church that wanted to act and got them into this film. This film takes the chance of filmmakers that actually want to do something good and give It to some religious Michael Bay, throwing Bibles explosions on your face (I'm not saying The Bible is bad, Is one of the greatest pieces of literature ever in my opinion). No, I am not an atheist, I am a agnostic, I don't know If a God exists or not, and until someone proves something for me I still won't know what to think. Now, above all I said before, the thing that in my opinion is the worst thing about this film is this: It can't even pass forward It's own message. The movie may seem like  propaganda in favour of religion, but the dialogue is so awfully bad that It lost Itself to contradictions, that is due to the script that obviously is also awful. NEVER, never in your entire life go see this film, It made me sick, and this is something I never thought would happen.",

Absolutely the same scheme, the same black and white world, only the positive guys turned out to be Christians and all the others are the bad ones.

As an agnostic, this didn't sway me, it disgusted me. My father is nothing like the atheists potrayed in this movie, and most atheists aren't. And lets be real (spoiler) even though the professor converted at the end and always had a faith in God, he is put up on a petastal that is supposed to represents nonbelievers as a whole, and it only makes the other side look bad, because it potrays secular people as inherently moral-less and bad.

We can point to many examples in Hollywood movies and Television where Christians are portrayed as unreasonable zealots. But this does not give us permission to return the favor and portray secular academia, or secular society in general, as antagonistic, cold, and shallow as this movie does. I typically hate to see stereotypical characters in any movie.  In this movie it is far too obvious who the \"bad-guys\" are in this movie, and who the \"good-guys\" are.  I would love to see a portrayal of a  philosophical debate about theism that doesn't give us so many obvious reasons to dislike those in the \"non-believers\" camp. As a movie that \"preaches to the choir, this movie is fine. But as a movie intended to be evangelistic, I do not recommend it. It is too heavy-handed and manipulative. And to think that it would not be perceived that way by most of secular society is insulting to them. Arrogance is typically more subtle, and therefore harder to find & acknowledge. Real humility requires depth of character and honest soul-searching.  To portray a Christian Faith that has real depth and compassion, we must reflect the depth that exists in the secular world as well. Anything else cheapens the Human condition and, on an individual level, the human soul. In it's place I recommend \"Chariots of Fire\" or \"To End all Wars\" as tools for Evangelism. These are movies that acknowledge Human struggle, intellect, and Faith hand-in-hand where the viewer can easily walk away with a positive view of the Christian faith while not being spoon fed. It's high time that the Christian movie-making community raise the bar. A world that was lost in sin led Christ to the cross. It should lead Christians to excellence in all of  it's Evangelical endeavors as well.",

This is come from an atheist by the way so I can explain why the movie doesn't portray use well. For starters take the class no atheist professor make their class all about atheism. The movie makes atheist look like oppressive monsters in reality christians have been the bully on the play ground and now that some ones has step up they cry oppression which is false. This movie is bad and don't waste you time.",
