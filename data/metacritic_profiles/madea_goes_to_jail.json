The majority of the film is focused around a hooker and a man trying to help her, while we get just bits and pieces of scenes with Madea. The majority of the jokes failed to make me even smile while I got insanely bored with the serious side of the film when we're supposed to be seeing Madea, given the title of the movie. The film suffers from identity crisis and fails at both drama and comedy. I would have given it a 4, but I'd be happier to see the negative user rating bar increase a little more.",
