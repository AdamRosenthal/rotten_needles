Bison really needs to rethink his line of work",

But honestly, everyone is comparing movies against videogames here. In a game you mash all those buttons, make combo hits, fatalities to take down the enemy. The story is usually ignored and 4 out of 5 people doesn't care about story in a game. In movie i want to know about the characters, their origins. If you put a 90 minute long fighting scene in a movie, there will be no difference between a game and a movie. I think this movie was pretty cool and exciting and the reason that many people disliked this was that they want to see meaningless fighting scenes, 10 punches + 3 kicks per second... I am a nerd too, I like marvel, dc, mortal kombat (not so much of a Street Fighter fan actually i always find that game rather dull) but honestly i want to see a background for characters in movies; not a 90 minute full with brawling and gun shooting. The only reason that i gave 9 instead of 10 was that interpol officers kinda stood outside of movie and couldn't participate that much. They should were either totally removed or used more often in film. I strongly suggest this movie to all of you who are interested\u00e2",

You'd think that that would be alright as long as the action sequences are good, right? Well, no. The action is terribly dull. McDonough is miscast - the antagonist he plays was not at all as menacing as he should have been. An utterly forgettable action film.",

Who exactly in their right minds chose a fan-favorite hottie from Smallville and the late \"Big Teddy\" Oscar-nominee Michael Clarke Duncan in the first place? Chris Klein sucked in this piece of trash. He should've taken the page out of the Dane Cook \"I'm a serious comedian\" playbook. But in my retrospect, Ming-Na Wen was the better Chun-li in the original Street Fighter. We laughed on this horrible offensive video game movie before, but I should just cut it some slack. It's still an awesome crap movie. But \"The Legend of Chun-Li?\" Meh.",
