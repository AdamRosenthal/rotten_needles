On top of being able to see nothing, we get to hear dull mumbles and linear dialogue for most the film.  The aliens seem to be systematically picking the group off, but it's not intentional, they're just too stupid to find them in even the most obvious hiding spots. Apparently hiding behind car doors, or in a basement cellar is extremely effective in thwarting super-intelligent beings.",

      "text": "This film is scary. It is actually way better than recent found-footage horror films such as \"The Marked Ones\" and \"Devil's Due\". It touches the subject of alien abductions realistically, with the use of few CGI and special effects in general. It is precious how the film is executed, with a breathtaking setting which happens that it actually exists and has the reputation of the paranormal. There are some well made shots in this film with the use of massive special effects, what makes it look so interesting and real is the statics that cover the special effects and makes it more realistic, it is the shot from the earth to the alien spaceship and from the alien spaceship to earth, when you see it you'll know it. The acting in this film is really good, I bought every single scene, well done! The film interviews people at the beginning (The Blair Witch Project) which makes it a high cliche. The alien lights in this specific mountain yes do appear in real life, but I doubt that the tapes are anything near real. The little boy masters cinematography and never misses a shot? I don't think so. The audio is not interrupted when the camera switches shots, so it would've been better off without the found-footage style. I would love to see a horror found footage film, that when paranormal things starts to happen, the film character drops the camera and the film continues as a cinematically shot film, it would've been interesting. Overall, I highly recommend \"Alien Abduction\" it is really well made, better than recent horror found footage films, although, I have the feeling that V/H/S segments are turning into feature films, first \"The Den\" (Skype segment from V/H/S) and now \"Alien Abduction\" (From V/H/S/2). Either ways, \"Alien Abduction\" is a better film than \"The Den\" and V/H/S movies are really good!",

      "text": "This film is pretty intense with a standard start that seems to kick off most found footage film. The drama and suspense comes from the fact that all you see is what the camera shows you. The audience perspective is through the eyes of the youngest family member who is practically attached to his cam in the movie. Not knowing the full surrounding, or greater understanding of the environment, actually creates suspense and intensity in \"Alien Abduction\". That is a cool trick when it works, a lot of films fail to capture this element fully, \"Alien Abduction\" creates a tense atmosphere filled with melodrama. The middle of the film sort of drags and the added character trying to help the family actually takes away from the momentum a bit. That is just the middle though. The last act kicks in with the expected benchmarks that service found footage films well.",
