The original camera shot footage by Steven Sodenburgh are eye catching and deeply subversive and brilliant. The Girlfriend Experience is total porno but brilliant and thought provoking in its own way. The film carries various themes- Romance, Drama, Adult, Black Comedy and much more.",

      "text": "Soderbergh was onto something with this film. Most of the reviewers who panned it complained that Sasha Grey's performance is \"one-note\". In my opinion, that's missing the point rather seriously. It may be valid to criticize The Girlfriend Experience for not fully addressing the many things it brings up; on the other hand, it doesn't claim to fully address anything. It's about an upscale escort in 2009 Manhattan but raises a zillion questions in an hour and fifteen minutes. World's oldest profession, right? And of course the 'upscale' angle is not exactly new either. But Soderbergh and writers seem to be wondering --on film-- if something is or might be new. Clearly, they don't know, but that doesn't mean the questions aren't interesting.",
