I do love mark waters and on the surface this movie was perfect for him a story about girls in a high school with vampires its not his fault for making the movie the way he does best it just wasn't the right movie for him. The things that make the book series so successful are the relationships between the characters and we didn't see enough of that due to the god awful pacing and the inner struggle and resilience of rose along with her determination to protect Lissa and that just never really came across. Did it fallow the plot points of the book sort of but it glossed over what should have been the focus the emotion and turmoil instead of the snarky remarks and attempts at memorable one liners none of witch i remember. It is that turmoil and relationship of rose and Lissa that makes it different from twilight or harry potter not making a twilight joke.",

The only thing I thing that would have made it better were (as a book reader) fixing Christian's and Lissa's personalities and the fast-pace.

It's like they ripped the first book in the series in half, picked every boring part in that half to place in the movie then, decided to leave out an important character in the series (Adrian) and to top it all off let's throw some cheesy/crappy humor in there and end the movie when things are actually going to get interesting. A serious fail considering how great the books were and, considering the director.",

Last Year, every YA movie (except Catching Fire) were not very good but at least I could read a little bit more about these books. Beautiful Creatures, The Host, The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones and Ender's Game all failed to find an audience and reviews were numb. Vampire Academy should be the next one to suffer because I really love the book series rather than watching a Mean Girls-like chick flick about two teenage students trying to find hidden secrets and dangerous paths of the Academy. The real problem was that it just wanted their attention and then fans just skipped the movie and see The LEGO Movie instead. Vampire Academy is pretty much the same and it has a tedious script, poor acting, make absolutely no sense to what the film is about (just in case you've already spend some time shopping at the mall). Wait a minute, is this the first movie from the director who jumpstart Mean Girls into a recipe for success? Yes, but that doesn't mean you want to make another one of the \"Twilight\" rip-offs. Fans could really enjoy the movie as often as they like, but I think Vampire Academy is one of the most disappointing movies of 2014.",

Honestly if I hadn't read the book I don't think I would have watched it. They have tried to recreate a Mean Girls style film which is fine because the books are about high school drama but I don't think they sold it to anyone with the trailers and this approach. They would have been better of attempting to go darker as that is the recent trends.

I did enjoy every little turn out of the events even though I've read the books first. Normally I would always prefer the books to the movies but this one is exceptional I guess. I don't think it's just another cheesy vampire movie neither it is a twisted version of mean girls. It's totally different. Yeah maybe the trailer represented a twisted version of the movie but if you take a leap of faith and watch it, I'm pretty sure you'll like it. The characters were just perfect. I don't know why some people are **** about Zoey playing Rose and Danila playing Dimitri cause they were just incredible. You can see how hard they'd worked for their roles cause every little detail of the book matches. Sure it's not going to be everything like the books you have imagined to be but if you already know everything then what's the fun in that? And trust me when I say, you will not regret watching this movie even if you haven't read the books first cause it's just that incredible. And to some \"any kind of vampire movie haters\" Please don't compare it to Twilight cause it's nothing like that. Like a famous person once said, \"Don't judge the book by its cover\" I'm telling you not to judge the movie by its trailers. Watch it and then regret if you want to but don't do the other way around. The plots were perfect, there was humor, romance and action - All in one movie. I'm looking forward to watch the other sequels of this series so please stop **** and let them make other movie versions of the books. Don't spoil this for the people who have actually enjoyed the movie and are eager to watch the next part. Hell some of you have sat through the whole twilight series, so why can't you show a little bit support on \"Vampire academy\" which by the way is so much better than other typical vampire movies (no offense). And some of you people are complaining about the age thing, well you have the read the books right? So yeah the age gap is supposed to be noticeable. I don't think anyone could've done a better role than the actors and actresses of this movie themselves.",
