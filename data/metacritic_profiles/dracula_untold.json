      "text": "If your a fan of other vampire movies like 'Van Helsing' who introduce a new adaptation of Dracula, this is a movie for you, however it's still mediocre. If you like Bram Stoker's Dracula, don't expect any similarities with this movie. Dracula Untold is a story about Prince Vladimir the Impaler (Dracula), who acquires the the powers of a vampire to protect his family and people from the invading Turks. A lot of the movie tries to show how the prince resists to drink human blood and he's struggles with it. But it looks like he doesn't seem to suffer to much. First you see him shaking and almost trying to bite his wife, and the next moment he's hugging his son. The movies in my opinion fails to portray the struggle he's in. The battle scene's are pretty well done, but is a bit overkill. But I get they wanted to show the awesome strength of the son of the Devil. The final fight between Dracula en the Sultan of the Turks was disappointing. Overall the movie wasn't that bad as some reviews say. The end was a bit emotional but unfortunately not enough to convince you of the hard choice Dracula has to make. The acting all though is very good. Luke Evans gave a memorable performance, as well did the rest of the cast. Special effects where also very impressive. I a bit torn on what score to give this movie. I wanted to give it a 5, but it did make me a bit curious about the sequel that might be coming. So i give this movie a 6/10. I hope that the sequel will be more of a horror flick than an action flick.",

The pacing of the story is absolutely all over the place, and the cinematography is nothing short of chaotic. This movie also committed the sin of sequel baiting at the end, when it's pretty clear to the audience that this is a one off action movie. I did get a couple of laughs from how ridiculous it was.",
