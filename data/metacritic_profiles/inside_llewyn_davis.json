Not just because it has been the soundtrack of many social movements, but of personal ones, too. Oscar Isaac as Llewyn is revelatory, a bone-tired, supremely talented man whose passion for making music is struggling mightily against the whims of the industry and his demons  one being the loss of his musical partner to suicide. When Isaac sings, we're transported first to the dusky bars of 1960s West Village and, more important, to the jungle of discouragement and confusion he's living in. It's a powerful performance. Supporting him is a great ensemble, some new to the Coen Brothers family (Timberlake, thankfully subdued and nearly holding his own against the others) and some beloved veterans (Goodman). It's not just Isaac and the cast, though, that makes Inside Llewyn Davis remarkable. The music, with T-Bone Burnett in charge of the soundtrack, takes its rightful place front and center. And the Coens tell the story in a clever, elliptical way that drives home the futility and magic of a time. But it's not all sadness and tears. The Coens' singular humor runs a streak through the entire enterprise. Go see it.",

I guess to allow John Goodman a chance to give a brief  quirky inexplicable cameo.  What did it show us about Llewyn except more of what a pathetic boring loser this guy is.  Good grief!  And the music definitely evoked all the memories of how puerile most folk music was.  If you want to watch a meaningful comment on that brief period, don't miss A Mighty Wind.

Other than that, the film had a lot of scenes that made me think of the film long after I left the theater.  I had never heard of Oscar Isaac before this film, but he is totally believable as a frustrated, gifted musician who makes one bad decision after another.  The movie is simply a week or so in a folk singer's life in the early 1960's, and how some struggling musicians lived and survived in the New York Bohemian scene.  It also reminded me a little of the documentary \"20 Feet From Stardom\" that focused on the mystery of why some talented people never become stars despite having obvious talent.  Loved the black and white photography and I really appreciate the Coen Brothers for thinking outside the box on some of their camera shots.

      "text": "I have a certain opinion about this movie that I think differs from most reviews I 've read(although there was a review by David Kempler that I totally agree with).Well my opinion is that, odd as it seems, by considering the movie a great one and by supporting its greatness with the evidence of the story's moral (the talented artist that goes uncredited forever), you don't really appreciate what this movie is about.I have to admit that while watching it I was not satisfied either with the script or with the way it was filmed, not to mention my aversion towards many of the songs (but I guess this is a matter of taste).However, I keep thinking about the movie three days now and I feel that it haunts me much more than movies  I've recently enjoyed a lot while watching.Why is that so? I think Inside Lllewyn Davis is a key to the cinema of Cohen brothers, a movie that enlightens the elements that make their movies special, and these elements, as is usually the case, have to do with a certain philosophy that transcends the movies and their particular stories and instead becomes the real center of their work(as expressed by the way they elaborate every story they touch into a kind of a myth with certain characteristics). To get started, I would say that the first thing to notice is that the cinema of the Cohens is  a cinema of ambivalence. Take Inside Llewyn Davis for example: I believe that the way the songs are treated in this movie leaves for the spectator to decide whether they are mediocre or the work of a genius;the way the songs of Llewyn Davis are treated by the people in the movie adds to this ambivalence;we hear that they  won't bring money, that he should get back to his duet work, we see people very satisfied with the songs(at the club, for instance)-but they seem to get satisfied with almost anything -and we know that Llewyn  believes in the potential of his songs, but not consistently and anyway they are his songs and this is what happens inside him.On the other hand, success could then be counted only in terms of making money, of being commercial,leaving the question of what real art is in suspense.This kind of suspense lies in the heart of the movies of Cohens, I believe.And also, what else lies in the heart of their films, I see clearly here, is that the main character is to be forever damned, forever excluded from the possibility of self fulfilment, no matter how closely he comes to it. Llewyn Davis, no matter how much he strives, has no chance(the guy with the costume that awaits for him is not the Times guy we've been expecting to change his luck but one who wants to beat him up, and for good reasons;the girl he's in love with, although ambivalent towards him,  won't ever conclude she's choosing him no matter how much we expect  it to be so; when a chance to meet his child comes out of the blue, and we expect him to change direction, he won't take it, and although it might not change anything, his inability to act makes it seem like one more lost chance;and,perhaps most of all, in a moment of stress, he will leave the cat behind, closing his eyes to the begging of the more human of his companions to this road to hell on earth.Llewyn Davis is, in other words, doomed;and he's doomed in the way Barton Fink was(perhaps the character that is closer to him in the Cohen's universe),",

Though some have accused it as leaving us with no satisfying conclusion (the end is rather sudden), they are forgetting that the Coen brother's surely never meant for it to have the cheerful climax that many films now copy. Instead, they lead us through the struggle, the pain and the anger that failure can incur on someone's life, with all aspects covered well - if not excellently - by Oscar Isaac. This is not to say that we should feel sorry for Llewyn - the Coens have presented us with a deeply immoral man here. Not only has he slept with his best friend (Carey Mulligan as Jean), but he seeks money to pay for the abortion from her current partner (Justin Timberlake as Jim, who we never really get the chance to learn about). Despite this, the film remains very likeable; for the Coens have always had a knack at keeping their audiences engaged to iniquitous characters. Jean - the aforementioned best friend of Llewyn who is played dryly yet hilariously by Mulligan - is at times a blueprint of this behaviour. Though she too made the choice to cheat on her partner, she forever blames Davis for the mistake she surely made too. However, she never fails to support him when he is desperate, and through this we get the impression that even Llewyn realises he needs her (not just music) to survive. Therefore, Inside Llewyn Davis is far from unsatisfying. Not only does it appreciate time for loneliness, failure, friendship and the power of music, it unveils a far more realistic and worthwhile tale of achieving success than perhaps many others have before it.",

      "text": "The Coen brothers return with 'Inside Llewyn Davis'; a bleak character study that is one of their finest efforts, without trying too hard. The film treks a week in the life of the titular character, Llewyn Davis; a folk musician struggling to make it in the business despite undeniable talent. Llewyn navigates the Greenwich Village folk scene of 1961, and encounters many distasteful characters from his life (not that he's a charmer, himself). Without being able to plan for the future or face his past (such as the suicide of his musical partner) the man lives in the now. With no where to go and nothing to fall back on, his life seems to be headed in a vicious circle; and the Coens smartly structure their movie to resemble this dilemma. The Coens are master screenwriters; and there dense existential screenplay on this picture is a testament to that. Though craft a handsome looking film with the help of Bruno Delbennel's desaturated cinematography, and those authentic costumes and sets. The man a the centre of it all, Oscar Isaac, does a great job at playing Llewyn Davis; a character who we couldn't help but root for despite all his bad qualities. His brooding presence and his delivery of those wonderful folk tunes, was a delight to watch. Unfortunately, similar to the hero of this story, the film is quite underrated; but, I see it shining years from now. Like folk music itself, this gem just feels timeless.",

Che non sar\u00e0 molto lunga, lo si capisce gi\u00e0 dal fatto che, per le vie del quartiere, Davis ci passeggia con un gatto sulla spalla invece che a braccetto di Suze Rotolo: del resto \u00e8 un artista appena discreto (probabilmente il treno giusto \u00e8 passato quando si \u00e8 suicidato Timlin, assieme al quale si esibiva come duo) e un uomo che la fortuna non dimostra di meritarsela. E\u2019 vero che bisogna sempre fidarsi della canzone e non del cantante, ma Davis dimostra di essere un egocentrico interessato solo alla sua musica e, di conseguenza, irresponsabile nei confronti degli altri, a partire da coloro che gli offrono ospitalit\u00e0 nel suo vagare senza dimora: lontano dalla famiglia, dorme sul divano in questa o quella casa e ha rapporti occasionali con donne altrui che poi lo ripudiano. Il viaggio della speranza \u00e8 verso Chicago, ma dopo l\u2019impietoso giudizio dell\u2019impresario Bob Goodman (F. Murray Abrahams in una piccola parte), Davis accetta nel suo intimo che la musica non potr\u00e0 essere la sua vita: dopo l\u2019ultimo spettacolo nel solito club, lascia il palco a chi cambier\u00e0 la storia e va a espiare parte dei propri peccati nel vicolo. Il risultato \u00e8 una commedia amarissima, come spesso succede nei lavori dei Coen: bench\u00e9 numerose siano le situazioni o le battute che strappano il sorriso e anche la risata, il sottofondo resta sempre assai triste in quella che \u00e8 la narrazione di un tratto nel percorso di vita di un perdente. Con una barba che fa molto artista e stretto nella sua giacchetta perch\u00e9 non pu\u00f2 permettersi un cappotto, Oscar Isaacs disegna con grande finezza un personaggio non facile, perennemente in sospeso tra le aspirazioni artistiche e la mediocrit\u00e0 di tutti i giorni: l\u2019attore nato in Guatemala \u00e8 praticamente sempre in scena e si districa con abilit\u00e0 sia sul registro drammatico, sia dal lato commedia e \u2013 oltre a dover maneggiare un gatto, animale che odia - interpreta con la giusta partecipazione le canzoni del suo personaggio (il maestro \u00e8 stato il supervisore alle musiche T-Bone Burnett, i brani sono quasi tutti traditional riarrangiati). Gli altri attori finiscono per essere fatalmente di contorno, ma ci\u00f2 non vuol dire che le loro prova non aggiunga valore al risultato finale: se questo \u00e8 vero anche per Justin Timberlake, lo \u00e8 ancora di pi\u00f9 per Carey Mulligan (che risulta assai pi\u00f9 carina da mora) e, soprattutto, John Goodman nella parte di un tossico musicista jazz che si diverte a massacrare a parole la musica folk (e Davis in generale) nel viaggio verso Chicago. Davvero azzeccate sono poi le facce dei personaggi di contorno, scelte con una cura davvero mirabile a partire dall\u2019anziano discografico Mel (Jerry Grayson all\u2019ultima apparizione) e coetanea segretaria per finire alla coppia di amici benestanti Mitch e Lillian con i relativi ospiti \u2013 i due sono i padroni del gatto che Davis si ritrova fra i piedi e al quale presta quasi pi\u00f9 attenzioni che agli esseri umani che lo circondano. Fotografato con toni in prevalenza freddi \u2013 e opportunamente invernali \u2013 dal francese Bruno Delbonnel, \u2018A proposito di Davis\u2019 non raggiunge il livello dei migliori fra i film dei fratelli Coen (ad esempio, la trasferta in una gelida Chicago \u00e8 tirata troppo per le lunghe), ma \u00e8 comunque un lavoro che, seppur non facile, lascia ampiamente soddisfatti, grazie a una capacit\u00e0 di fare cinema subito riconoscibile nelle atmosfere come nella rappresentazione delle singole situazioni \u2013 basterebbero le inquadratura nel ristorante deserto sulla via per il Midwest o la prospettiva kubrickiana della scena nel bagno. Infine, un\u2019annotazione curiosa: il titolo italiano non compare mai, perch\u00e9 quello originale si pu\u00f2 vedere solo in una fuggevole inquadratura dell\u2019 (invenduto) disco solista del protagonista.",

What it is, is a character study that explores what it's like to be a struggling musician in a what appears to be a dying genre (at the time). I quite enjoyed the film. Oscar Isaac's performance was superb, most notably his musical talent. It's really quite beautiful how much we learn about Davis in a one week period. It might seem like a bit of a downer, but Inside Llewyn Davis is a human experience that reminds us of that passion and talent isn't always recognized.",

      "text": "The Coen brothers latest release Inside Llewyn Davis blends together many of the elements that have proved a success for them in various earlier works. A lack of redeemable characters, their signature dark offbeat humor, no apparent narrative and a very special genre of music in the soundtrack. The year is 1961 and Llewyn Davis is a struggling folk-singer who used to be part of a somewhat successful duo and is now trying to get his break as a solo artist. He's also a homeless drifter, who sleeps on whatever sofa becomes available and he's without a steady income. The film certainly paints the picture of rougher times, which produced big dreamers and resulted in deeper music with true passion.",

Yes, it is shot well, and I watched it till the end, while still intrigued. It didn't get too boring during. But it is totally pointless after all. They teach even the children that every story should have a proper ending. Apparently the directors are too big to bother with such. Most of the branches of the story are not finished either. To try explaining it better: imagine somebody is telling a story and you are interested by all the things starting to develop in it. And you expect it all adds up and mix together. But when the story is finished, you realize that all of these \"interesting\" things didn't actually go anywhere. And the only indication for the finish is that it suddenly stopped. Major BS if you ask me.",

Oscar Isaac leads the cast with a performance so mesmerising, it's a mystery as to why he wasn't nominated for an Oscar. The supporting cast, particularly John Goodman, also turn in fantastic performances. The production design, as one would expect from a Coens film, was amazing. There were plenty of memorable songs (my favourite being \"Please, Mr. Kennedy\") and great dialouge. Keep in mind, it's not always easy to watch- after all, the central theme of it is failure- but nevertheless, it's still a great movie, highly recommended to fans of the Coen Brothers' previous work.",

Closer to some of the Coens\u2019 smaller films such as Barton Fink and A\u202fSerious Man than to breakouts including O Brother, Where Art Thou? and No Country for Old Men, the French-financed CBS Films pickup nonetheless is a singular work by the protean filmmaking team.",
