I agree with the fans. Many of the critics compare this movie to the original superman movies as they said that those movies had more heart and humor.

Let me reiterate, NO... BAD...ACTING... even the criminally underused actors didn't in any point in time under or over act their roles, and this is a movie with more than enough respectable names in supporting roles. I think the best way of describing it as, would be a \"sci-fi\" superman as opposed to a \"comic book superman\" this isn't the avengers, where a city is invaded and little to no casualties occur, this is people being killed and \"the boy scout\" having to step up and make a choice between the people he longs to connect with, or humanity whom he's afraid to try to connect with. The very magnitude and serious handling of these drives make for the first recent origin movie of one of the biggest DC superheroes to be worthy of being just that, while everyone can of course respect the old romps that were the christopher reeve films, this transcends those early camp beginnings and offers up something that is truly special. The irony is that those that seem to be scoring this movie low, seem to be of the kind that would prefer another hackneyed love story with a silly bit of action a la superman returns.

      "text": "A WORD OF ADVICE: Don't mind what critics have said about this movie!  MAN OF STEEL is a masterpiece!  Go watch it for yourselves.  The film is worth every dollar you'll spend on movie-going.  Don't miss watching this on the big screen especially in 3D to enjoy it in its fullest glory.  Even if you have a big flat screen 3D TV, don't wait for the DVD or BluRay format in stores cuz you'll miss a great deal from the actual big screen experience.  Of course, we gotta buy our own when its out on the market cuz were going to definitely see & enjoy it again and again.  I have seen this 3 times already and, every time, it got better and better to a point of concluding that Zach Snyder is indeed a true directorial genius and the David Goyer-Christopher Nolan storytelling team-up equally outstanding in retelling the Superman canon!  Retrofitting in today's advances, the filmmakers succeeded beyond our expectations of rebooting this most loved superhero of all-time.  Without the red brief (why is it outside by the way?), Superman looks current and does not look at all like 75 years old.  We call this film \"Superman Reborn\" and aptly so.  Fresh as a morning dew, MAN OF STEEL literally saves the day and ultimately takes back his rightful place which is at the top of the heap of all superheroes.  All the actors were perfectly cast.  A very determined Henry Cavill was not \"humorless\" as he took on a more serious (not Dark Knight dark) version of the Man of Steel. The-not-too-feminine-blond-more-than-brunette Amy Adams was perfect as Lois Lane to Cavill's Clark.  She had enough held-back spunk & flirt in her reminiscent of all the other Lois-es like Margot Kidder & Teri Hatcher who truly owned the role.  It was smart of them to make this version of Lois Lane not that dumb to recognize through Superman's disguise (glasses, really?) and it was great that the filmmakers did not explore the romance between these 2 characters (there's just too much to take in) reserving it for the sequel as they focus more on Kal-El's search of being (To critics: this is the reason why Cavill's humor is held at bay. Try checking out MAN OF STEEL's commercial on Carl's Jr and Hardee's. You'll know this actor is far from being \"humorless\").  Michael Shannon exudes shades of Willem Dafoe/Joaquin Phoenix in his performance as a more likable Zod here---meaning, he is nothing short of brilliant as an actor.  His chilling delivery of \"YOU ARE NOT ALONE\" ominous message gave us goosebumps galore.  It has a spooky feel to it reminiscent of \"The Ring\".   The scene-stealer of the house was Antje Traue as Faora.  Man, that woman kicks serious ass!  And you'd think Michael Shannon's Zod's badass-ness was to the rafters---Hers skyrocketed and blew the top off!  She's undeniably the Eve to Zod's Adam, in other words, the whole thingy can't be told without her.  And then there's the 2 Robin Hoods, Russell Crowe & Kevin Costner.  It was such a treat to see these 2 great thespians in one film.  One word to describe their presence---EPIC!  Both of them brought a whole new meaning to that word.  While Russell Crowe re-introduced us the Gladiator we all loved in the introductory part of the movie, Kevin Costner gave us Field of Dreams all over again bringing (a tug in the) heart, soul and balance throughout the film.  Laurence Fishburne as Perry White was a superb choice.  He was great as a leader-of-the-pack Morpheus in the Matrix films and he was equally chief to head the Daily Planet in this one.  He truly embodied the sharp boss of Amy's Lois Lane   Unfaithful's Diane Lane is no stranger to take on the role of a mother to a child gifted with superpowers.  Remember she was the mother to Hayden Christensen in JUMPER so it's but naturally fitting for her to be cast as the \"hot version\" of Martha Kent (You know, hot dude--hot mom, makes sense right?).  Lucky Henry Cavill gets to have not just one but two hot mamas here.  Although Ayelet Zurer's appearance as Lara Lor-Van El (the real mother of Kal-El) was only brief, her steely heartbreaking performance was searing enough to last.  To sum it up, MAN OF STEEL have enough ingredient for every movie-goer to enjoy.  The action is fully packed especially in the climax part of the film.  Watching the sequences is like being in the final series of loops of a roller coaster leaving you wanting more at the end of the ride.  And what better soundtrack than Hans Zimmer's brilliant otherwordly drum-rolling score to keep the excitement going.  If John Williams made us believe a man can fly in the Donner films, Hans Zimmer made us believe Superman can soar & battle again for superhero supremacy at 75 in this Snyder extravaganza.  On my first viewing of the movie, I thought there were small lapses in the editing but concluded later on in my second and third viewing that it was artfully & thoughtfully done---more cohesive than I have originally thought.  Go watch MAN OF STEEL and see for yourselves then watch it again!",

The actors were perfect, with Henry Cavill shining in the superman outfit. The script was perfect, penned by goyer and nolan, presenting the story of superman's origins and his difficulties, and at the same time having enough feel of 'realism' to it just like the dark knight trilogy. The action sequences were just plain awesome, providing enough special effects to compare with the avengers. This movie was just what the once-popular hero needed, an emotional origin story with some butt-kicking action.

I'm talking about Earth, that is. As for the special effects, they were spectacular and simply struck something in you. I particularly loved the portrayal of the love between Clark and his foster father. The scenes weren't very cheesy but managed to pull off a sense of deep love between the two.

Everyone gets their fair share of time, I did want to see more of Kevin Costner that said. After the spectacular opening on Krypton, the film loses steam and I questioned it's pacing, but was quickly relived by how the story is told is the often non-linear style used by Nolan and Goyer Zach Snyder's direction fits the film perfectly, there's a bit of lens flair saturation but every sequence is filmed beautifully. And the action, just incredible, the flying is violent, you feel the environment shift. You get to enjoy the film more and more as it progresses, i wish they'd taken more time to delve further into the story but clocking in at around 2 and 1/2 hours, there's a solid amount of content and a good story.

It has brilliant supporting casts, notably Costner's amazing performance as Jonathan Kent. Cavill also delivers as a more 'grounded' Superman. The action sequences are reminiscent of 'Japanese Anime', hence the critics 'resistance' to that particular palate: supersonic fights, buildings demolished to smithereens.

While there were a few clever effects shots, mostly it was Michael Bay levels of CG for 3D's sake here.  So many things go unexplained that it feels like Dark Knight Rises all over again.  When we DO get cause-and-effect, the story contradicts itself so many times that its obvious Snyder and Nolan had no idea which version they wanted to go with.  I heard so many \"huhs??\" from the audience at each new realtime reconning that it I couldn't help laughing at it after a while.  The mood at credit role was somber.

Every character feels like a cardboard cut out, which is unforgivable when you cast the likes of Russell Crowe, Kevin Costner, Laurence Fishburne, Amy Adams, Michael Shannon, and Diane Lane.  Man of Steel tries to be dark, and at times it is, but the movie is a little too corny to be taken seriously.  It's basically a slightly better version of a Michael Bay film, and that is obviously not meant as a compliment.  I can't remember the last time I was more dissapointed in a movie, but I suppose that's my own fault for getting excited for a Superman movie.",

First of all, it is fairly slow getting started: we don't see Clarke becoming Superman until like a third of the way through the movie, which is kind of a big deal for a Superman movie. Also, the last third or more of the movie is almost entirely Superman fighting the bad guys, which is fun to watch, but lacks substance--and even gets a bit boring. Finally, the movie hurts itself some by leaving some plot holes/character inconsistencies open. I don't want to give away anything, but it takes you out of the movie a bit when you see Superman being overly concerned with protecting life one moment, but then casually endangering it the next. All in all, still a good movie, but it really relies on the strength of its action scenes, not the introspective stuff it tries to pull off.",

      "text": "This looks like a (similar) job for Superman! Look, up in the sky! It's a bird! It's a plane! It's Super\u2026 Excuse me. For a big budget motion picture remake of perhaps the most recognizable comic book superhero Man of Steel is a tamely run-of-the-mill effort. It is generic blockbuster personified, and is a bleak, characterless, lacklustre, uninspiring, disjointed and overly rigid entry in an intermittent franchise, which ironically struggles to take off. What's the \"S\" stand for? Well in my world it stands for Super-Serious as opposed to Superman. Never before has a superhero been so unwilling to express any discernible passion for their cause, simply maintaining an impassive poker face the whole time. The fate of mankind hangs in the balance, Superman to the rescue! Screams excitement right; however, Zack Snyder has somehow turned this tried and tested premise into a dreary, rather monotonous exploit, even if the visuals and set pieces verge on stunning; more dull and lifeless than dark and gritty. Henry Cavill is cool, calm and collected as Superman; however, he comes across overly reserved and emotionless far too often. Cavills' steely resolve is rarely visibly tested even if the goings-on impart otherwise, rendering his portrayal of Superman a tad difficult to adhere to on a humanistic level. In addition to this, he appears sound in the fabled suit but his rendering of the celebrated superhero comes across too deliberate and noticeably premeditated, although he does find his feet towards the end when the movie is given a much-needed shot of adrenaline. Man of Steel lacks fluidity, it is apportioned with often brisk and abrupt scene changes, and provides an unkempt collation and abstract composition of extracts and gestures to scenes from other movies. It is also complacent on character introduction, being naive in thinking we all know about the characters enough to not have to shed too much light on them; notably a lackadaisical introduction to Lois Lane and her backstory, further marred by a romance kindled out of thin air. All in all, Man of Steel supplies a moderately attention-grabbing experience, albeit unhurried and void of any palpable sentiment. In addition, it does not break any new ground and sets an overstatedly grim-faced tone that future installments in the notoriously up-and-down series that has experienced its fair share of highs and lows in the past will have to address if they are to garner the widespread approval of the audience.",

Instead what I got was a snobby Lois Lane who had terribly modest and even cheesy dialogue, a \"Superman\" who was developed in a rather sloppy way, unintentionally hilarious moments, and a villain who yelled at the camera half of the time. Not to go overboard, I will simply say that I did not like this movie. I can acknowledge some pros though: the Super suit was cool, Zod's \"purpose for which I was born\" monologue in the final act was cool, and the sequences in space were breathtaking. Still, Man of Steel had nearly NO CROWD PLEASING MOMENTS....the comic relief moments spread in the movie were a hit-or-miss and would gain maybe one chuckle or a laugh out of the audience. And don't get me started on the action sequences....don't get me wrong, I love a good action movie, when it's well served. I highly enjoyed Fast 6 because it didn't try to be more than what it was, a simple mindless action-packed popcorn flick with well-placed humor and overall solid pacing. However Man of Steels action....boy was I bored by it. Explosions and skyscrapers collapsing left and right and even some annoying shaky cam in certain sequences that voided any chances of my investment. One of my friends mentioned two Easter eggs in the film: A Luthor truck and a satellite in space owned by Wayne Industries...BUT... since I WASN'T invested in the movie thanks to a sloppy and awkwardly paced script, I didn't notice these Easter eggs at all unfortunately. I personally felt also that the opening in Krypton was cool at first, but soon became over-extended. Am I the only one who felt that the special effects in this film weren't that impressive? If I am, so be it. Clark Kent/Kal-El's development was rather modest...it could've been done much better and more depth could've been put into it. Instead, the scenes of his upbringing would come in awkwardly and they felt kind of intrusive at times. This movie felt very inconsistent in terms of writing. Man of Steel's pacing was incredibly sloppy. One scene Kal-El was in a ship, then he was in a bar, then he was in the north pole, then he was suddenly Superman. Yeah, not very consistent pacing if you ask me. Overall, I was incredibly disappointed by this film. I really wanted to love Man of Steel. I wanted an excellent Superman flick with a terrific origins story that resembled the quality of Batman Begins. Man of Steel was hyped up well, but terribly under-delivered.",

There are frames that could be hung as artwork, but as a storyteller Snyder is ponderous and dull. Granted, Man Of Steel is his best work since 300 (I feel Dawn Of The Dead his best so far), and the set pieces are spectacularly staged, but 2 and a half hours of earnest, EARNEST material about a flying alien Christ figure is a bit much. The only hint of humor is the refusal to even say the name \"Superman\" (maybe spoken twice during the whole movie). I'm not saying we have to dive into the overdrawn characters of the Donner version, or people speaking in witty banter like The Avengers, but a little humor goes a long way. The acting across the board was fine..hey, I actually didn't hate Crowe, as I have most of his roles lately. And the technical credits were all first class.",

      "text": "Man of Steel is highly overrated, it's a decent film at best because it's not the definitive Superman movie. Henry Cavill is no Christopher Reeve but at least he's an improvement over Brandon Routh. It's a long-overdue reboot for the franchise but I'm really disappointed by the lack of character development and the movie spends nearly an hour and a half retelling the origins of Superman that we all know to well. Kal-El is born, Krypton gets destroyed, Kal-El is sent to Earth to save their species, ponders his existence, finds out who and what he is, finds out about his parents and where he comes from, finally has a purpose in life, becomes Superman, saves people, Lois, people generally accepts him. There's really no need to spends hours telling a story that everyone is already familiar with, even the reboot of Spider-Man got the origin story over and done with within minutes and we got to see all the other characters in action. This is the problem with Man of Steel, it spends so much time telling this story that they completely forget about all the other characters in the film; even Lois feels diminished. On the other hand, I do like how the story is told. Whereas most action or superhero movies go from one action sequence to another (which can abruptly interrupt with the story), Man of Steel tells the whole story first before they overload on set pieces and CGI effects. I just don't understand how at the end of the fight, the whole city looks like an apocalypse and they're able to fix it so quickly. But I'm guessing with the help of Superman, anything is possible. The amount of action is absurd and buildings falling down is so cheesy but I enjoyed every minute of it, especially when Zod uses some machine that can lift up cars and smashes them back down (that was pretty epic). But obviously, the special effects doesn't any significance to the film. Overall, it's an above-average film. I was a bit disappointed though because we were long-overdue for a Superman film and I really expected better. Whoever tells you that it's better than the first two Superman films, and even Superman Returns, is lying to you. That's how overrated this movie is because a lot of people would go as far as to say that. Man of Steel is better than Superman 3 and 4 obviously (because those were terrible) but it's the weakest \"good\" Superman entry in the franchise.",

Even at the beginning of the movie the destruction of Krypton is more complicated than in the comic books but it adds to the story. I had my concerns at first when Henry Cavill was cast as Clark Kent/Superman. He proved he can play Superman but we didn't get to see the Clark Kent nerdy reporter side but for the most part I'm sold on him as Superman. Seeing Superman fly at high speeds and fight the other kryptonians was amazing! Critics did not give this movie a fair shake its one of the best superhero movies I've seen. Finally I'm happy to say Man of Steel is superb,amazing, and Super! 9 out of 10",

I had a really hard time finding a flaw outside the movie, that is besides the main flaw: Lois Lane. Now my reasoning is this: She comes in on a dig site to be in the right place at the right time, wants to find the mysterious man she met, does basic research and I do mean basic, asks a couple questions and find Clark. She also stated that he has spent a lifetime hiding.  When Zod comes and demands Clark/Cal they specifically ask for her even though she has no bearing at all besides the comic book relation. Forced into more of the story by being on a Military aircraft during a bombing, and needs saving on more than one occasion. Zack Snyder forced Lois to be the love interest to fill the comic fans of the golden age. As for the rest of the movie, it was great. The fights showed how Superman is truly Superman who is struggling with his full potential. Great origin and cast. All of the movie besides the forcing of Lois Lane to be the love interest was amazing.",

Well they win by successfully presenting a fresh and updated take.  It's moving with the times.  It's very good so give it a chance.  There are hardly any boring moments and the action is great. Cavill makes a sombre and amateurish Superman in his early days believable.  Amy Adams is good in just about anything she appears in and in Lois Lane she has given us the best version, be it comic book or film.

It captures Superman perfectly, showing off just about all of his powers, and giving a very good retelling of his origin story.  I think this movie is better than any of the Superman movies that came before it, because those movies were all about crazy fun, and no seriousness whatsoever.  However, this movie is almost totally serious, and is more like a modern day superhero movie.  The retelling of Superman's origin story is done flawlessly, and is relatively easy to follow.  It was very nice seeing how Clark Kent turned from an outcast at school into the world's greatest superhero.  It had a pretty cool villain too.  The special effects of this movie are phenomenal, making the entire movie look great.  All of the explosions and punches sounded very good, and the CGI is flawless.  The movie really is a sight to behold and listen to.  However, the best thing about this movie in my opinion is the soundtrack.  Hans Zimmer did a fantastic job with this movie's score, and I think that it is the best soundtrack that he has ever composed.  In case you are wondering why, well not only does it sound amazing but he achieved the impossible: making a soundtrack that could top John William's Superman soundtrack.  Yes, I think that this movie's soundtrack does indeed top John William's soundtrack.  The reasoning behind this is that despite John William's fantastic job with the original Superman score, it only seemed to capture Superman's heroic side, and not enough of his emotional side.  Hans Zimmer manages to capture both sides with his incredible soundtrack, which in my opinion, makes his soundtrack better than John Williams' in this case.  The movie is also very well written and acted.  The writers wrote the lines perfectly for this movie, and the casting and acting were also done very well.  Overall, I believe that this is a truly fantastic movie, and the critics are rating it far lower than they should.  This movie has not only more than earned my vote for movie of the year, but it is also a perfect movie that brings back one of the world's most iconic characters in history.",

As for the plot, it's still pretty average, not always logical and somewhat too serious, BUT the action here is stellar. From the astonishing opening sequence to the epic in all means final battle the action here is the best I've seen in a long while. Seriously, no one, not the Transformers, and not even the Avengers have destroyed half a city in such a spectacular way. Superman and his foes exchange devastating blows, throw trains at each other and punch through buildings, and that really gives the chills. Another chill-giving aspect is the soundtrack  Hans Zimmer just couldn't fail in this department, the score is purely epic. To sum up, Zack Snyder, Christopher Nolan and David Goyer (director, producer and screenwriter, just in case), considering a pretty weak and bland character they were using as a base, performed admirably, making one of the best blockbuster movies I've seen in a while.

However, I was pleasantly surprised with the film. Man of Steel retells the origin story of Kal El and follows the story of him as an alien trying to find his place in the world. The film benefits from a smart, fresh take on Superman and strong performances from the cast, with Henry Cavill owning the role of Superman. While very different from the older Superman movies, yet somehow similar, Man of Steel delivers on what Superman Returns failed to give moviegoers back in 2006. High octane intense action sequences, and consistently strong writing. Overall, a fantastic, yet imperfect superhero film, with something for hardcore fans and newcomers alike.",

I went to this only to appease my boyfriend and out of curiosity. This was a truly great film. It might not be oscar caliber but honestly it doesn't need to be to be great. Most hero origin movies are the \"boring movies\" in the trilogy and are handled very chronologically. You always have to deal with the hero having that awkward phase where they are trying to find themselves. It's a fine premise but most of the time it consumes way too much of the movie. The origin story in this movie is handled very well with the flashbacks of the past at appropriate times that last as long as they need to to get the point across while the main story in the present progresses. This film does have flaws that would take a long time for me to explain but flaws and all I enjoyed this film. It never bored me or made me hope it was gonna wrap up. I understand not every hero movie should take the Dark Knight formula of realism but it had a good balance of fantasy and realism. I dare say.... no I'm gonna say it I enjoyed this movie WAY more than Dark Knight Rises and think it's a superior movie (raise your pitchforks at me if you must).",

In all the Comics and cartoon, Superman always had very Sci-Fi stuff involved with a lot taking place on other planets with different technology and had a lot of action and destruction. None of this awesomeness happened in those older movies. Instead, a bunch of stupid crap happened, like Superman flying around the world to turn back time and him sleeping with Lois, which he would never do.

This movie is just as good of a reboot as, if not better than, Batman Begins, The Incredible Hulk, and The Amazing Spider-Man. This is the first time I actually felt like Superman in a live-action movie was actually super and awesome and actually had a threat that was worthy of him.

I feel like the flashback approach felt way too choppy and unnecessary.  I feel it could have all been settled with even one simple flashback upon him in the water that lead to coming back out after, minus the end scenes with his father that could have then been brought about in a \"finalizing\" flashback after.  Also, him finding the ship, due to the choppiness, felt extremely rushed and out of place.  I'm hoping for and extended cut that gives slightly more story there and transition.  Also, while it was necessary for the current story, Lois Lang's story felt arbitrary overall, with her almost put into scenes and events by the \"hand of God\".  She didn't get time to really be her OWN character, instead more there ONLY to develop Clark.  Those minor gripes aside, the rest of the story-telling was, especially everything related to Krypton, Zod, and the interaction and plot there-in was stellar!",

Jor El was great, The Kents were great, and Zod and Faora were mazing! I loved the new backstory for Kal, it was a very interesting take on a story we've all heard before. Now, where this movie really wowed me was the action. Never before have we seen a Superman movie like this. Heck, in the previous films he hardly punched anything. So to have about an hour of super good epic actiony goodness was amazing. The effects were great, the fight was epic, and the fallout from the battle is incredible. I really don't know where they can go from here, because this movie really pulled out everything. The movie, however is not without it's issues. The Lois Lane relationship feels a bit forced and the final ending sequence has some things that i would have changed to more properly follow the tone set up but the conclusion of the epic battle. Overall though, i really think this movie will make a believer out of anyone and i hope more people can finally enjoy my favorite hero of all time, Superman.",

But, if you really liked the character-driven Superman Returns (the previous Superman movie), then this movie may not be for you. Personally, I was really disappointed with Superman Returns. I thought it was way too slow, and quite frankly, boring. No one wants to see a heartless Superman who solely exists to fight bad guys and save the world, but I think the reason so many people feel in love with Superman, in the comics, was because of his abilities (and his \"rescues\"). And this movie, unlike Superman Returns, thrived on showing them off. Yet, with that said, it did not fail to provide like-able characters. They may not have had much depth, but when they came on-screen, they succeeded in fulfilling their roles. As a result, in my opinion, Man of Steel perfectly blended the action and plot needed to achieve an epic film within a 2 hour time-frame. Superman spent plenty of time saving people in this film, but you never had those cheesy moments in between that were simply unnecessary. There was very little Clark Kent, the reporter. And I liked that. Ultimately, this was exactly the kind of Superman film I wanted. Action-wise, it captured Superman in a way he's never been seen before, the script provided a down-to-earth Superman that was very believable, and the score, provided by Hans Zimmer, perfectly set the tone for the movie. It's early but I loved this film, and I think it may be one of my favorites.",

      "text": "Zack Snyder's dark take in Man of Steel, a la Christopher Nolan's Gotham, really worked in my opinion. I've always felt that Superman had one of the more tragic of backgrounds and the more uplifting and happier stories never felt genuine. Richard Roeper's criticism that \"There's very little humor or joy in this Superman story\" or Rafer Guzman's criticism that \"this reboot skimps on fun and romance\" shows just how many critics missed the point. This isn't a kid's story, period! Leave all of those childish and whimsical expectations at home. In my opinion, this grittier version really hit home and took the drama and intensity to whole new levels. While it failed to deliver on the level of the some of the Avengers: Phase One films and definitely wasn't on the level with any of the movies from the Dark Knight Trilogy, it was still a great movie. The acting was really good, especially from Amy Adams in her supporting role. She managed to turn a character without a lot of development into one with a surprising amount of depth and believability. And Henry Cavill was great as Superman/Kal-El, probably my favorite yet. The supporting roles by Michael Shannon, Diane Lane, Russell Crowe, Kevin Costner, and so on were all also fantastic. I don't think I can remember a movie where all of the supporting roles were played by people more famous than the protagonist but that was the case here and it worked because of Cavill's performance and how the movie was laid out. The action sequences were great, as was to be expected, and the way the plot developed was not annoying as most critics claimed. Many felt like the constant back-and-forth hurt the film's progression but I actually quite liked it. It kept the two and a half hour movie from dragging and felt fresh. The one flaw that I felt actually took a bit away from the movie, however, was the shaky-camera cinematic effect. I'm sorry but this isn't a world where the audience is going to feel the \"we're there\" and in the actual scene itself. All that did was make you wish it wasn't there. Overall though, this was a great movie and while I've never been a big fan of the Superman lore, if you can remove bias and suspend quite a bit of disbelief I think most would really enjoy it.",

I liked seeing Clark background story from earth it helped make his seem more human and gave him a reason to defend earth. the main villain in the film general Zod is under used. most of the fight scenes in the film are done by his troops until the very end of the film where at the end of his relatively short fight Clark just breaks his neck and its over in a second it was a bit underwhelming after all that he just snaps his neck. The acting all round is good Henry Cavill is a great superman Michael Shannon while not being as good as Benedict Cumberbatch in star trek is still one of the best villeins this year.

Lots of destruction, (even a building going down, which in post 9/11 is ballsy, glad they did it though) but what do you think would happen if two super being fought in an urban landscape?  One thing I had a bit of an issue with, Superman does something superman would never do, but I'm ok with that.  Henry Cavill was the best superman yet (He WAS SUPERMAN!!), wouldn't say he was the best clark kent  I think Chistopher Reeve did the best playing clark, and was an awesome superman as well), but Caville was just a beast.  nice to see a superman movie without the same old premise, by that I mean no kryptonite the entire movie!!  I liked the last superman made, superman returns I believe, and thought the story line was good with him having a son, didn't like the ending in that one.  This one obviously has no ties to that movie.  This movie was slam, bam, destruction and action most of the movie.  This superman reminded me somewhat of  just all the destruction, he wasn't boozed up or anything like that.  Anyway go see it if you haven't already!!!",

Everyone had great performances, especially Micheal Shannon. The scale of this movie is literally nothing you have ever experienced before. The amount of carnage and building destruction is unbelievable but at the same time you believe it, which brings me to the visual FX because this has to be the most visually stunning movie ever made and for a superhero movie, it works. Zach Snyder is the king and ever since the watchmen (10 out of 10 as well) hes proven that he along with Nolan is the best a bringing these extraordinary characters to life.

First it  needed to be longer in order to have General Zod in it because it to good of a enemy to be used in the first film.

Tom Hiddleston's Loki has nothing on Michael Shannon's Zod here. Even The Hulk will have to kneel before him & will just have to settle on a fight with Nam-Ek.

If you loved the trailers, then you would know that there is a lot of action scenes and CGI used. Character development is really focused on Superman, Jonathan Kent and Jor El. Superb acting from Henry Cavill, Kevin Costner, Russel Crowe and surprisingly, Amy Adams. I had my doubts about her, but she did an amazing job as Lois. This is not a throwback to the old Superman movies. You must accept it like Batman Begins, an origin story that is much different than what you are used to. The only problem comes from the fact that we didn't really understand Clark's struggle as an adult like we did with Bruce in Batman Begins. They could have explored it further. The story was great for what it was. I think that now that we have characters set up, we can expect an even better sequel. It might not have lived to the hype for some, but there is no argument that this was a great movie. Especially when compared to Superman 3,4, and Returns. I think it is on the same level as Superman 2. Some could argue that it is better. Just watch the movie and prepare to be amazed.",

Its a darker, smarter, and brilliant Superman and superhero film. Zack Snyder wouldnt have be my first choice for this film, but took what he had and used it well. I think what really offputs critics and viewers was the use of Nolans (The director of The Dark Knight franchise) name in the film. I think alot expected to see a brilliant witty and twisty dark film, but were instead given a brilliant Superman film. Superman is not Batman, and never will be.

While all other superheroes in recent past were all patterned after Donner's Superman films (except for Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy), this one is not.  You won't find Robert Downey Jr.'s humor here.  Henry Cavill's elusive \"brooding\" take of the comic character is far different from Christopher Reeve's charismatic friendly turn because Snyder's darkly-serious MAN OF STEEL is not Donner's straight-from-the-comic-book colorful SUPERMAN.  Despite the stark contrast, Cavill was able to capture the magic back that was long-missing since Chris Reeve hang up his bright red cape.  Cavill on film, you would swear, on several scenes and at certain angles, looking like the late great Reeve.  He has the same convincing intensity onscreen as the late actor.  You wouldn't wince but nod in familiar recognition that this actor is indeed the Superman we all missed all these years despite of many others' attempt to measure up with Reeve's indelible iconic take.  We remember the media were all hailing Brandon Routh's close resemblance to Chris Reeve but after getting picked & cast for this reason in 2006's SUPERMAN RETURNS, it turned out he didn't look the part & came across unconvincing.  Indeed, good things come to those who are willing to wait & the wait paid off for Henry Cavill and for this reboot.  It's everything we ever wanted from a Superman film minus the cheesiness.  With today's technical advances, Snyder & company were able to re-imagine for us what our favorite hero could be without limits.  Forget about what critics are saying about MAN OF STEEL.  They did not get a pay cut from the film's promoters that's why.  Instead, listen to the movie-going public who were right to give it an A- rating in Cinemascore.  In Rotten Tomatoes, SUPERMAN RETURNS got a 75% rating from the critics while MAN OF STEEL gets only 56%? Go figure...",

It also deserves at least two viewings to get at all the nuances of the epic SF scope the movie sets up, which is also my only gripe with Man of Steel  it crams maybe a little bit too much into one movie, which makes the dialogue feel \"stiff\".

      "text": "To first put my perspective of Superman in check would be to inform you of what I've seen before. There are of course the first two Christopher Reeve movies (I skipped out on III and IV simply because I've heard nothing but terrible things) from which I moved onto Bryan Singer's 2006 Superman Returns. I enjoyed the romanticism and meditation of that film despite it now being panned by pretty much any fan boy you talk to. I've never seen an episode of \"Smallville\" and sans for a couple of animated features my knowledge of the DC mainstay is somewhat limited. Thus it was with great anticipation that I looked forward to a new vision, a re-booted film interpretation in line with Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy that has defined the space that films based on DC comics characters will occupy in this Marvel world. Personally, and as much as I enjoy the Marvel movies, I was more intrigued and engaged by the bleak and more serious moods that hung over the Nolan films as they were appropriate to the central characters tone. Though I was slightly concerned with this same tone not applying to the guy commonly referred to as the ultimate boy scout it seems that persona was not always true and director Zack Snyder along with Nolan as a producer and David Goyer (who also penned the screenplay for Batman Begins) have adapted the Superman story to not only exist in a similar universe with Nolan's Batman films, but within his own, more realistic world that doesn't simply pit the classic superhero against a bad guy in order to champion truth, justice and the American way. What they have done here and what makes me appreciate the film all the more is that while keeping in step with the kind of movies Nolan has made DC could attempt a Justice League movie in the future with this as a good place to start, but it also doesn't limit itself to that same completely realistic world of what we know because Superman is an alien and with that they ask the question of what would happen in a real world setting if Superman were to show up. It is that basic set-up that guides the film throughout and, despite a few flaws, had me gushing with excitement for what may come next.",

No le doy 10 por problemas con el montaje, el inicio es confuso, y esos saltos entre presente y pasado hace que la historia no la termina de asimilar, he incluso la transici\u00f3n entre escenas es inmediata perdi\u00e9ndome por no saber cuanto tiempo ha pasado  Con respecto a Louis Lane, es un personaje cre\u00edble, intr\u00e9pida como son los periodistas y con una excelente personificaci\u00f3n por parte de Amy Adams, pero en el guion por tratar de ponerla como protagonista queda en situaciones forzadas, ella es humana, no puede estar en todas partes. Como por ejemplo cuando la gente de Zod se la lleva al espacio sin justificaci\u00f3n y cuando en la pelea final, luego de Superman y Zod pelear por toda la ciudad, alej\u00e1ndose por km de donde empezaron, Louis llega a los minutos al sitio. El hecho de planificar la pel\u00edcula como un unitario fue lo que hizo que fuera extensa tratando de abarcar toda la historia, por lo que f\u00e1cilmente se puede dividir la pel\u00edcula en dos, una donde muestra a Jor-El luchando por sacar a su hijo de Krypton y la infancia de Kal-El y la otra donde por fin vemos que Zod amenaza a la tierra. El papel de Crowe que pens\u00e1bamos que seria olvidado luego de su muerte tiene una importancia incluso mayor que las que tuvieron los padres adoptivos. Shannon hace de villano espectacularmente, sera todo un reto conseguir un villano m\u00e1s fuerte que \u00e9l para la 2da entrega. Los padres adoptivos de Clark- Kent entre salto y salto en el montaje hace que se pierda su objetivo que es ser la parte nost\u00e1lgica y reflexiva de la pel\u00edcula. Cavill como Superman mostr\u00f3 un gran carisma que Routh no pudo lograr en Superma Return.   La maldici\u00f3n de Superman se ha roto! Creo que puliendo estos detalles( un montaje m\u00e1s ordenado, Lane en situaciones propias a sus limitaciones como humana, consiguiendo un villano cruel) la segunda parte ser\u00e1 igual o mejor que The Dark Knight",

Man of  Steel is one of the greatest hero films ever i am very proud of watching the movie it is really a great story line of telling superman how his struggle in the world to become what people really need him to be the savior of earth. I thank you to Zack Snyder, David S. Goyer, and Christopher Nolan who made this film to put DC back in it's place and to bring back the greatest superhero come to life again. Man of Steel is the perfect movie to watch over and over.  I also would like to thank the cast members of playing their role in Man of  Steel they did a excellent job at being the characters and making this movie happen. What ever critics are saying that man of steel is not a good superman movie they are wrong this movie captured everything including great story details, this is a new generation a new era where superman will once again reign supreme as the greatest superhero on earth and in films.  #1 MAN OF STEEL is GREAT",

      "text": "To be honest in my humble opinion, the opening sequence on planet Krypton felt so much more fleshed out than the entire Star Trek reboot films. That blew my mind away and got me sold on the whole movie instantly. Man of steel was an emotional ride for me. I found myself tearing up a couple of times during the first act of the film. Credit must go to David Goyer and Snyder for capturing the internal turmoil and strife that Clark Kent faces before accepting his calling to be the beacon of light that guides mankind from becoming extinct like Krypton. The action sequences were a beauty to behold. I was glad there was no use of slow-mo effects that Snyder is infamous for in his other films. I actually can picture Nolan\u2019s universe of batman existing in Snyder\u2019s superman universe. The lack of comedic relief in this 1st outing of man of steel can be forgiven because it was important to get his back story fleshed out for potential sequels. I think by taking a serious and realistic approach to this franchise they can build a solid foundation for JL movie or a World\u2019s Finest movie. What also liked about man of steel was how the \u201cvillains\u201d where defined in their motivations. General Zod and Faora\u2019s back stories were really logical enough and added more depth to why they wanted to takeover earth in order to continue Krypton\u2019s existence. Last but not least, Hans Zimmer\u2019s score really pulled the strings in magnifying the scale of this movie. He captured all the emotions you should feel in every scene just by the use of music. Simply amazing! I\u2019m gonna watch again 2moro in Imax 3D because I watched it in 2D only. I have to see planet Krypton in glorious 3D.",

What i mean is that this new movie DID NOT give me any goose bumps during the movie whatsoever.  And that is a very bad thing. One thing that killed it for me is that the superman song is not in it.  After the movie ended i was like:  \"What the hell???\"  What happened to the superman song, the super hero song???  From what i recall, THAT is what gave me goose bumps in superman 1 as soon as the song began playing for the first time, you know, when superman begins to fly?  Heck, even now after decades when i watch Christopher Reeve's first superman I still gives me goose bumps.

      "text": "Man of Steel is nothing short of an action epic. This movie has probably the greatest action I've ever seen. People are complaining about the action, but really, do you want another Superman Returns?! This movie has good character development through a series of flashbacks featuring the key moments in Clark's past, that make him the man he is today. This is Superman like we've never seen him before in a movie, there's no Clark Kent fumbling round the offices of the Daily Planet (I'm sure that will be in the sequel) but instead there is a man on a mission to discover who he really is, where he came from and what his purpose is in life. The opening scene to Man of Steel got me fully invested into the film, the action kicked off straight away and set up the villain for the rest of the film. General Dru Zod is one fantastic villain for the first film in a hopefully long franchise, he was menacing, fierce, but had reason behind his cruel and violent actions. The performances in this film were brilliant. Henry Cavill is the best Superman but on the screen so far, yes I said it, Christopher Reeve was a fun Superman, may he rest in peace, but this Superman is a character you want to root for, to save the world at the end of the movie. Henry Cavill really gave Kal-El depth and emotion, and I hope he stays on as Superman for a long time to come. Russell Crowe as Jor-El, Kal-El's biological father, was a very some very good casting, a big improvement from Marlon Brando. Amy Adams was a good Lois Lane, although I believe they should have saved the Lois and Clark relationship for the sequel, it felt quite rushed in this film, but what women wouldn't fall in love with a flying man who just saved the world. Michael Shannon is a very good General Zod, he is menacing enough for the audience to fear him, but gives the character depth and reason behind his actions, and at some times even makes us sympathize with Zod. Kevin Costner as Jonathan Kent gave some great emotional scenes and gave some great lessons to Clark about who he is going to grow up to be. The CGI was fantastic in the movie and the excessive use of it did not take me away from the movie at all. All round I do believe this Superman is the best we've ever had, the performances are great, the score is miraculous, Zack Snyder's direction for this is pleasing and the pacing of the movie is great! You can definitely see Christopher Nolan in parts of this film. David S Goyer's script is fantastic with little hidden gems like Lois' line 'Welcome to the planet' which had me smiling like an idiot. And keep a watchful eye DC fans, for those subtle easter eggs to other villains and characters in the DC universe. Ii am very pleased with Zack Snyder's take on Superman, and I hope he stays on as director for future movies. I only had a few issues with Man of Steel, and believe me they are few. For one, a line that a women soldier says at the end of the film 'I don't know, I just think he's kind of hot'. Seriously, what is that?! There is one scene that should have been changed to a more emotional and character building scene rather than just Superman fighting mechanical tentacles. And the relationship between Lois and Clark should have been saved for the sequel, because as I said before it felt rushed. Overall I think Man of Steel is one fantastic movie, the best of the summer so far, and the best of the year. I'm giving Man of Steel a 4.5/5.",

      "text": "Man of Steel Was worth the wait, time, and money I dropped to see it.  While Nolan and company may have fell a little short in character development and cheesy lines; Lois Lane having to tell Perry she is a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist, the story telling and cinematic fair far outweigh what is missing.  It also looks like some of the character development may be left to the sequels which brings me to my next point.  As I was watching the world of Krypton unfold before my eyes and listening the cool history of it narrated to me by Jor-el, all I could think as Kal-el zoomed towards earth was, \"I want more of that!\"  The entire world and history of Krypton the way it was depicted could easily have been its own movie a la Prometheus y Avatar.  The only way the story and characters develop into critic approving fair is if this film is broken into at least two or three separate films to build the relationship between audience and characters.  Obviously, that is something critics of Snyder have had for some time.  The more I write this review the more upset I get at the missed opportunities of this piece.  I can visualize a Man of Steel series not unlike Joss Whedon's Firefly series with the awesome Serenity film finale.  Keep the actors, tone, mood everything, just replace the guy behind the camera and the film editors...can you people see it?  Ugh...Speaking of Whedon, if there was a silver lining in the film, it was Snyder's use of camera work in many of the film sequences that were definitely influenced by Whedon.  I was a late comer to Firefly and I caught it last summer on Netflix.  Remember the scene where Serenity is being chased by the Reavers and Wash has to pull some fancy maneuvering to escape?  That camera work was so cool, I must have hit the rewind button a dozen times to keep watching that sequence because I had never seen action shots filmed in a way that I could actually SEE the action and experience it as if I was flying with the ship itself.   Since then, I see that technique used more and more frequently and it never fails to amaze me.  It is so much easier to enjoy and SEE the film instead of seeing a jumble of flashes and letting the synapses of my brain translate what my rods and cones are interpreting.  I may have taken the scenic route to explain this, but Snyder's use of these shots was so much more clear as opposed to watching a Michael Bay film that is all flash and chaos.  OK.  So Man of Steel, though at times a little thin in character development and story telling, is definitely worth the time and money.  I can't wait to see any sequels alone or with the Justice League.",

It's an unfair bias to think of watching this film and expecting to see the goofy bumbling uncoordinated Clark Kent, if so, you'll be disappointed. I had read a review from a critic stating that not once did Superman smile. But, was it necessary for him to do so, knowing that people's lives were at stake and an alien invasion was imminent? For the record, Superman and his alter ego, Clark Kent do crack smile. It is easy for the Superman from the first Donner film to smile. How can he not, when all he needed to do to avert a major disaster was to fly at light speed to reverse the Earth's axis to revert everything back to normal?

Henry Cavil looks the part and acts like the sort of humble, polite, qualities that come with Superman. Amy Adam's Lois Lane is for the first time important to the story, she is given things to do and she does them well. No longer is she a \"damsel in distress\" but rather, an important part of Kal-El's journey to accepting his identity as Superman. The two fathers  Russel Crowe as Jor-El and Kevin Costner as Jonathan Kent are convincing and truly want the best for their son. Kevin Costner, in particular, moved me to tears. The only member of the main cast who I felt was slightly weak and out-shadowed by the others was Michael Shannon as General Zod. Sure, he was menacing, powerful, and a physical threat to Superman, but he was not on the level of great comic book villains in film such as Loki, Joker, or even Ra's Al Ghul to name a few. I would liken General Zod to Bane  the actors did a good job but both characters were given too little to do. Although Michael Shannon tried to convince the audience of his point of view, Antje Traue's Faora ultimately overshadows him as being a threat, deadpan delivery and utter ruthlessness makes her much more than a pawn. The special effects are amazing. Zack Snyder just knows how to make epic  and whether you take to his style or not is personal preference. Speaking of the director, Nolan's touches are obviously in this film. The noir color palette, the story, and the dialogue is very much Nolan but infused with Snyder's style as well. A couple of lines made me cringe, such as the army officer saying that Superman is \"hot\" and the controversial ending where (SPOILER) Superman kills Zod. Lines like those prevented me from fully immersing myself into the film. David Goyer's story is very much a comic book story, with twists and turns, exploring the psyche of Superman. However, I doubt if he should have attempted to stuff so many themes in a 130 minute(?) running time. In the end, not one theme resonated with me and the actor/actress's performances stuck with me. Overall, Man of Steel is the best film since the original Superman  visually impressive, strong performances, and some action (ahem Superman Returns) makes this easily the summer blockbuster of the year.",

      "text": "Ok so Im sorry but, critics are only as good as their taste! Man of Steel is the greatest comic book movie of ALL time! It is everything a superhero movie should be! Critics say its too serious and blah blah blah but did these people ever read a comicbook? Superman is a lost soul, an alien from another planet who never chose these powers, but is forced into deciding how to use them. That is more than just a dilemna. It is a choice that if it were true, humanity would have no choice but to conform to. Man of steel brings that question to us in a real world setting, where Kal-el has to make choices none of us would want to. This is a truly heartbreaking movie with incredible soul that the critics seem to miss in their reviews. He is an alien who is trying to figure out who he is and why he is here! He isnt a human with all our flaws, he is flawless and doesnt know why? Who wouldnt be quiet and seek solitude in that same instance. The actions sequences are very heavy, but please remember it is a superhero movie and really what would happen if aliens came here to take over and one of them decided, that wasnt going to happen! Heck we as humans have destroyed countries in seconds, imagine what super aliens could do! Henry Cavill is amazing, you feel his strength and his weakness(not kryptonite) his weakness as has always been his love for this planet and the humans who have adopted him. Critics aside Man of Steel is a great reboot to the franchise and as was Batman Begins it will be remembered for years to come. Go see it true fans will love it!!!",

      "text": "Man of Steel was a very enjoyable film IMO. It wasn't perfect, but it's a fun ride. I love the overall themes, fight scenes, and all the acting. I was cool with some of the core changes they made that might make some hardcore fans mad as well. The pacing of the first half felt rushed and disjointed, and I wish they did it more linear so we could get more of Kevin Costner with young Clark and get more invested in the character rather than flashbacks moments interspersed throughout. I enjoyed the fight scenes immensely (though I get the complaints about them) and thought the last 45 mins of the film were stellar. I especially enjoyed how much this movie incorporates not only the super hero saving humanity but humanity (especially Lois) helping save him as well as Superman empowering them to save themselves. Superman is the ultimate immigrant who comes to make his new world a better while also realizing he cherishes, needs, and dependent on his new home as well. I think they did a decent job exploring this theme. Overall, it's a good modern take on Superman that gets me excited to see Superman in all his glory for the sequel now that the origin story is out of the way. Also, I loved the subtle moments between Lois and Clark in the film. More in the sequel please. I give it a 7 or 7.5 out of 10. Not as high as I wanted to be but nowhere near the asinine rubbish most movie critics make it out to be. Don't listen to their bloviating. It's miles ahead of Returns and a good step in the right direction.",

After reading lackluster reviews I went into the theater expecting to be disappointed. Once I saw how the Krypton sequences unfolded I was hooked! Critics be damned! This is everything I wanted in a Superman movie. The effects are amazing.  The fight and flight scenes are beautifully realized and the emotional punch of the flashbacks are an inspired way to build the foundation of our hero's journey. Henry Cavill was the perfect choice for the suit and gives Clark a more grounded and morally conflicted soul. Amy Adams as Lois Lane infuses the character with more intelligence and bravery than previous incarnations and is given more to do than just get into trouble. Kevin Costner and Diane Lane shine as Ma & Pa Kent and deliver the most emotional scenes in the film. I only wish they could've spent a little more time on the Kents as a family. Russell Crowe is exceptional as Jor-El and Micheal Shannon's Zod a wholly different interpretaion of the character. His motivation is driven more by genetic predisposition than a megalomaniacal mind. You can tell that a lot of love was poured into this film, and the layers will keep me coming back again and again. Superman is back and better then ever!",

      "text": "This is an epic, action adventure tale of one of comics finest heroes, and Snyder and Nolan have presented him in fine form.  For years fans have been clamoring for a Superman film that adequately presented the character and presented him with the formidable challenges he would experience in the pages of the storied comic book series  and now they have that Superman on film.  While many people consider the first Christopher Reeve  Richard Donner film to be the 'genuine article' when it comes to seeing this character on film, they fail to realize that within the pages of the comic lies the TRUE Superman  he has had many arcs told presenting many different sides to his personality, and one of the biggest criticisms of this film  that it is too dark  has also been portrayed within the pages of the comics from which he was born.  The entire 'Death of Superman' storyline gave a dark gravitas and weight to the character and thrust him into more modern times.  So why so upset that this film takes a more 'serious' approach to the story of Kal El  Clark Kent?  Perhaps it's that most critics still revel in the joy of the first true superhero movie made by Reeve  Donner so long ago that they have skipped decades of comics which flesh the character out in a more serious and somber tone more often than people would think.  If you are unwilling to accept this fact, that Man of Steel is a modern, real, and serious take on this character, then you should own the first two Superman films on Blu-ray and maybe read some of his comics...you might be surprised with what you find.",

This movie delivers from start to finish. The story is fast paced and for being 2 hours and 23 mins it flies by so fast I couldn't believe when it was over. There are certain characters that are not given the time they deserve but I feel it all made sense for the story. This isn't your Richard Donner Superman movie, this is Superman in the real world. When he is discovered things move fast and with the arrival of Gerneral Zod things really pick up. There is plenty of development of Clark, and General Zod is a creepily good character. The real surprise for me was Russell Crowe, Jor-El was given an excellent role and his character was one of my favorite parts of the movie. Like I said not all characters get great attention, like Perry White, but I feel that we will get that in the next movie. The ending of the movie sets up the next ones perfectly and I left truly excited to see more. The movie is action heavy, and it has awesome set pieces and the special effects are truly spectacular. If your looking for your family style happy go lucky Superman movie this isn't it. If your looking for a great Superman movie that taps into the full potential of this great iconic character this movie is exactly what your looking for. Could there be improvements made? Yes, Does that effect the quality of the movie, absolutely not. I don't think I really could've enjoyed this movie anymore than I did.",

It sets the scene for the entire story and I think it was just about as perfect a beginning we could possibly have had. We then come down to earth (literally) where we find Clark Kent discovering who he is and coming to terms with his powers and what a responsibility that places on his shoulders. Much of this is told in flashback with some great fatherly advice from Kevin Costner. It\u2019s a section of the film that may have lost some (probably due to the lack of explosions) but I really enjoyed it as it gives us a chance to get to know what motivates Clark/Superman, and just what makes him a superhero. The third act, however, is where I had the most trouble. The plot wasn\u2019t hard to follow and the acting was great, particularly Michael Shannon, no, all that was great. The problem was with the fight scenes; why is it necessary to topple skyscrapers and destroy entire city blocks. It put me in mind of climactic battle in \u2018The Avengers\u2019 movie; I had the distinct impression I had seen it all before. Yes, it was quite a spectacle but I would have liked something a little more original. But don\u2019t let that distract from the fact it is still a very good film and one I would happily watch again.

      "text": "Man of Steel re-imagines the legend of Superman in modern movie fashion  beginning with the story of his home planet, Krypton. We first witness the miraculous birth of Kal-El, son of prominent scientist Jor-El (Russell Crowe) and Lara Lor-Van (Ayelet Zurer), who happens to be the first naturally born Kryptonian (i.e., not genetically engineered) in a long time. Unfortunately, Kal\u2019s birth comes just at the time when Krypton\u2019s society is fracturing under the fear inspired by Jor-El\u2019s prediction that the planet\u2019s end is nigh. An attempted military coup by General Zod (Michael Shannon) sets into motion a series of fateful events that see young Kal-El raised on Earth, where he is warned by his adoptive parents (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane) that his god-like alien powers will one day force him to make a choice about how he will change the world for better or worse. And when Zod and his minions suddenly appear in Earth\u2019s orbit, ready to finish what was started on Krypton, Kal-El/Clark Kent realizes that his prophesied moment of choice has now arrived. As was hoped for by many, Man of Steel is a fine marriage between the rich character-centric storytelling of Dark Knight Trilogy architects Chris Nolan and David S. Goyer, and the signature visual talents of director Zack Snyder. The movie is very much \u201cSuperman Begins\u201d in terms of its narrative approach and structure; however, in terms of themes and tone the film achieves its own identity as an insightful, reverent and effectively relatable Superman story. Are there liberties taken with certain details of the costume, origin story or character relationships? Of course. But then again; this is a fresh start to present a new Superman to a modern world  and in that, Man of Steel ultimately succeeds. Visually, this is Snyder\u2019s most impressive film yet  and it looks pretty stunning in 3D. Everything from Kryptonian culture and technology to the way Superman\u2019s powers (and the impossible physics surrounding them) operate looks on point and believable (enough) in a real-world context. Add to that an abundance of visual iconography and head nods to both the comics and Richard Donner\u2019s seminal films (in particular Superman II) and it\u2019s clear that Man of Steel\u2018s director has true love, understanding and appreciation for the subject matter at hand. The action sequences  while at times a bit too CGI-heavy  are pretty epic in nature and certainly deliver on that perennial fanboy desire to see a film that depicts how super-powered beings would look and feel battling it out in a real-world setting. The wonderful pacing, editing, smart selection of scenes and abundance of action make this two-plus-hour ride go rather quickly; although by the climax, seeing flying men get punched through buildings over and over again might have you checking your watch. The score by Dark Knight composer Hans Zimmer is phenomenal and heightens the film every turn, while also establishing yet another new-age superhero theme to replace a classic favorite (John Williams\u2019 Superman theme from the Donner films). At the same time, Man of Steel  is not without some noticeable narrative flaws. The script can be very \u201ccomic-bookish\u201d in some scenes of dialogue, and the jumps in time and place during the first act are not as cohesive as they were in Batman Begins. Clever editing and speedy movement earlier on often comes at the price of effective narrative development. In short: if you were one of those people who were hung up on the question of how Bruce Wayne made it back to Gotham after escaping prison in Dark Knight Rises, you\u2019ll find similar gripes with Man of Steel. Thankfully, the studio and filmmakers pull the same magic trick they did with the Batman franchise by casting an impressive array of highly-talented actors, who help elevate the weaker points of the script. Meanwhile, Diane Lane, Kevin Costner and Russell Crowe add Oscar-caliber gravitas and heart to the film as Superman\u2019s two sets of parents. Crowe gets a substantial amount of screen time to really flesh-out the character of Jor-El like never before, while Lane and Costner totally carry the family drama subplot, which is the most moving and beautiful element of the story. Even military side-characters like Genearl Swanwick, On the whole, this movie is exactly the sort of experience that many Superman fans have been asking for, with the added benefit of having some smart storytellers providing fresh insight into why the character is one of the most iconic fictional creations out there. Like Nolan and Christian Bale\u2019s first Batman outing, Snyder and Cavill\u2019s first crack at Superman isn\u2019t a homerun (we\u2019ll call it a triple), but having succeeded in re-introducing the franchise to the core.",

To make this brief, this movie has wonderful writing, wonderful acting, amazing effects, beautiful sets and costumes, a great amount of weight to the world and its people, deep characterization, and a conflict that actually takes some thought. There is only a couple of flaws with this movie, which is why i have given it a 9 as opposed to a 10. 1: Zod chewed the scenery too much for such a serious movie. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE some cheese every once in a while, but when the entire world takes everything so seriously, Zods overacting at points in the movie is kind of out of place and silly at times. 2: A couple of times people will say information before they know about it, like when a general says \"Krypton\" before Superman has mentioned that he is Kryptonian or from Krypton.",

Far from retreading the same steps the film focuses on Clarks' struggle over what to do with his powers and getting the world to accept him. I was particularly glad to see Clarks' childhood shown in brief segments showing why Superman does what he does as an adult. I also enjoyed the portrayal of emotion on Supermans' face shown with close ups; the first flight for example, as this really makes the character more real as that's how a normal person would act in such situations. The direction of characters was solid through out although the action scenes felt a bit jaggy as it was almost like the audience was in the middle of the fight and possibly not getting the best possible view of the action. I also felt as though although the General Zodd character was quite good he didn't quite fill the shoes of those who played the role before which is slightly disappointing and takes away somewhat from the film. Conversely, Jor-El ;played by Russel Crowe was used brilliantly and really helped the film as well also as the portrayal of Krypton  which compared to previous iterations felt alive more like a genuine planet.",

Snyder has spawned the start of what could be an incredible franchise worthy in comparison to how \"Batman Begins\" stemmed Nolan's Batman Trilogy.

Scripting is very accurately done. Cinematography is world class and 3D view of the movie is worth watching. The movie deals with highly modern technologies but not much gadgets were used as we see in other Action movies. All the action sequences are extremely brilliant. It surely defines a new era of Action scenes. Overall the movie is an outstanding mixture of ethics and action. It does have the charishma and brilliance of Iron man and Avengers movies to some extent. Must watch! Go for it straight away.",

Lastly, the fighting scenes were done beautifully as well as Hans Zimmer's score. If you love superhero movies, or your just looking for an amazing summer movie, MAN OF STEEL IS THE ONE TO WATCH.

And when you're talking about an iconic character like Superman, I think that's almost a crime.  From the get-go, when CGI monsters are attacking Krypton, I knew things were off.  The introduction of an \"S\" as meaning something Kryptonian is also just silly.  There's not even a breath of the Clark Kent many of us grew up reading and watching in film and movies  this is a total 'reimagining'  this Kent is charmless and dour, and ruled largely by fear in this movie.  Fear of being found out, fear of being different.  A Superman crafted of these elements tells a totally different story  it was never Superman's though.  It was Batman's, Spider-Man's, and a ton of other heroes, but never Superman's.  The dialogue is so stiff and cheesy, which might work in a comic-book interpretation  but here they're trying to make Superman into something emo and pouty, so it just comes off as contrived.  The effects are okay and the action works, but that's where all the attention went  and for a movie about the origins of a superhero, such a lack of character development is surprising.  Then there's just stuff like people wandering around in arctic climates in just a coat, no problem  that sort of thing.  But the biggest sin of this movie is that instead of being thoughtful, soulful fun built around very solid characters, like the Christopher Reeve movies, this one tries to make huge over-the-top action sequences be the 'fun' part.   I just feel it falls short on so many levels.  We're not supposed to think of Superman as badass.  We're supposed to think of him as our greatest advocate and defender  a man of unwavering character who doesn't have to think twice about motive or intent.  He always does the right thing, the good thing.  He's SUPERMAN.  Here he's just an 'every guy' trying to make it in this world with superpowers.  Superman was always bigger than that.  It is in fact what set him apart from all the Spider-Mans, Wolverines, Green Lanterns, Avengers, etc etc etc.  Oh sure, he played cat-and-mouse with his identity (a single pair of glasses magically managed that for him for decades), but I don't think the intent of the story was ever to feel bad about his role, almost like he's a victim.  Superman always was, and always should be, a representative of the opposite of that  he's the guy who never thinks twice about his role or place and just always strives to do what's right by the human race  and does it with a smile.  All while being a nerdy reporter on the side.  I don't know where any of this went.",

As for some complaints about not resolving relationships and such, this movie is meant to establish such relationships and complications, so they can be explored and resolved in the sequels, right? Superman has been around for 75 years, so I think it is hard for some viewers to recognize that this movie presents us with a neophyte hero  this is the first time he's wearing the suit and making tough decisions. As long as the character grows into the icon in the sequels, then it's a good thing. Do we really want a character, in an origin story, that has nowhere to develop?

There is a balance, between Goyer's Screenplay and the emotional and wonderful acting of Russel Crow; the menacing Zod, & Snyder's action and attention to detail.

It elaborated the sci-fi element beyond just crystals and more crystals which I thought was an improvement over the older movies.  And Man of Steel may have some plot holes but so did Superman 1-4.  Such as if he can turn back time, why not use that every time a villain gets the upper hand?  You could call it Superman: Groundhog Day.  He just keeps repeating things till he gets it done right.  But despite that people still loved the movies, and I think the critics got it wrong with this one.  I highly recommend checking it out.",

      "text": "Man of Steel is a remarkable film that critics don\u2019t seem to fully understand but audiences everywhere are finding to be easy to love. Before I delve into the core of my review, I need to point out that the argument that this movie was an unnecessary reboot is completely absurd. It has been over 30 years since we had an origin story for Superman! Modern audiences have not been exposed to Superman in any real way ever since (Superman Returns does not count). If anyone deserves a fresh start, it\u2019s Kal-El. Now, regarding the tone of the film, which critics have claimed is too dark and overtly serious, I feel that it works well considering what the filmmakers want to establish. Superman needs to exist in a more realistic world and that\u2019s just what Man of Steel provided. Our world isn\u2019t always happy and Man of Steel does wonders when it explores this very concept. However, I need to point out that Man of Steel is not the dull and lifeless film that critics are making it out to be. On the contrary, there are actually instances in the movie in which I and the rest of the audience broke out laughing. As for the plot, I genuinely believe that Man of Steel delivered a good story. Moviegoers get to see a dramatically different Krypton and are able to watch as Clark develops into the man he is destined to be. While there were issues with pacing, at times, this is easily forgiven considering the breadth of the story the filmmakers were trying to tell. The acting in the movie also happened to be quite excellent. Henry Cavill has a decent amount of dialogue and makes very good use of it. I believe that his Superman might be the best interpretation of the character (yes, even better than the great Christopher Reeve). Amy Adams, Michael Shannon, Diane Lane, and the rest of the cast also do an incredible job. However, I need to give special praise to Kevin Costner. His Pa Kent truly is understandable and the love he demonstrates for his son was enough to bring many in the theater to tears. The action in this film is, naturally, amazing. Zack Snyder\u2019s keenness for this stuff shines brightly in the film and I did not ever get tired of what I was seeing. To wrap things up, Man of Steel is a wonderful film and the critical reviews it has been getting show one thing: today\u2019s professional reviewers have become so twisted that they can\u2019t recognize a good film when it\u2019s right before their eyes. Do yourself a favor and go out and see the film for yourself. You\u2019ll love it.",

Oh so Clark's dad thinks he an outcast and then kills himself for that idea (It was a marvelous scene which was very shocking and amazing) but that doesn't really excuse what humanity is like our survival instincts would have popped up in that situation. But I respect the character and the time they spent developing him. Excellent sci phi, The best I've seen in awhile in comparison to the other movies that came out (The purge,Evil dead) this one is amazing but due to the ending Superman kills Zod and the villans just being dumb. That's what keeps this movie from being a 10/10 100% recommend and I will be buying it when it comes out on Dvd Watch  http://www.angryjoeshow.com/ For game reviews movie reviews and a lot of comedy",

      "text": "Finally a Superman movie the way it's supposed to be. Sure I had some minor problems with it (Lois' character ends up becoming a sidekick, some continuity issues), but overall, the directors do a great job of showing why he is the 'Man' of Steel. There's moments of genuine tension because one actually doesn't know if Superman is going to be able to save the day. \"How is he going to do it?\" is a valid question in this film, unlike Brian Singer's 2006 martyr depicting disaster in which it was just assumed that Superman somehow wins (aside from the incredibly stupid plot). Focusing on the origin story also gives us insight into the superhero abilities of the character and the limits of his power; not the god like omnipotent Superman that critics love, but a superhero with abilities and powers that have weaknesses (otherwise Green Lantern would never be a match for Superman). This is a movie that will delight fans of the superhero and the comics, not over intellectualizing critics who love the 'idea' of Superman and what he represents. As for the action  a nicely nefarious and destructive earth-destroying plot by the bad guys, fleshed out with some great graphics and art work. Good fight scenes that see Supe getting variously pummelled and also doling out some beatings. Again, that doesn't seem to appeal to the critics who slammed the film for 'too much action'. Dude, this is Superman; if you want character development, watch Pride and Prejudice. Ironically, the critics miss their own portentous pretentiousness when they at once claim the film is too sombre (I think it has an appropriately dark mood) and then ask why the characters and love story aren't the focus. Superman; action-film; ass kicking; excellent. They also seem to miss that Nolan and Snyder manage to masterfully highlight how being a child of two worlds is the central dichotomy of Superman's character and how it hurts him to be alone. It\u2019s not a maudlin love for Lois Lane that\u2019s tearing him apart, it\u2019s the loss of his parents, his planet, his past, his people. He is evolutionarily superior to humans, but chooses to protect them out of love. That is the essence of the character, an idea that previous films have touched upon but never delved into, including the classic, but campy, 70's films. A lot of criticism focused on how the duality of Clark  Superman is missing, while missing this obvious duality between the human and the alien that is actually what Superman is about. More to the point, comparisons to the previous \u2018Nice-guy\u2019 Superman of yore and the whole idea that the character has lost his \u2018innocence\u2019 are almost nauseating; the whole reason Superman is amazing is because he\u2019s a bad-ass, not because he\u2019s a nice guy. In the 70\u2019s it was possible to be a nice guy, witty bad ass, like Chris Reeve, but that kind of humour is completely pass\u00e9 today. The film does have genuine moments of comedy, but they are situational and not forced or driven by an innate image of the character. This Superman is a genuine bad-ass, quite unlike Brendan Routh. Comparisons to The Avengers also miss the point; The Avengers\u2019 quirky humour is a part of the Marvel universe; DC comics have always had a darker, more serious, tone to them that the producers put across well in this film. All in all, a film that critics are sure to hate but that audiences are sure to love.",

The first part of the film is filled with some excellent Clarke Kent and Krypton back stories that were elevated by the performances of Kevin Costner (Jonathon Kent) and Russell Crowe (Jor-El); the two father\u2019s of this film. I must give Henry Cavill a hand for maintaining the win streak of fantastic Superman performances. While Christopher Reeve captured the charm of Superman and Brandon Routh did a slightly brooding interpretation, Cavill excelled at capturing the physicality of the Man of Steel. With all these high marks remaining constant; the beautiful introduction gave way to bloated, explosive action sequences. The action was unhinged and needed some serious taming, because it didn\u2019t afford the filmmakers anytime to develop our other characters or elevate the plot. And the story itself, as effective as it may be, didn\u2019t really cover any new ground. This Zack Snyder is a director who can always create a nice looking film, the world of Krypton in particularly is brought beautifully to the screen. He\u2019s also always able to focus on those minute visual details like those frame-for-frame shots from Watchmen and 300 that were taken straight from the comic book. In this case I-Hop restaurants and other familiar settings litter the background of every scene to make the audience aware of the \u2018real world\u2019 setting in which this movie takes place. These are all nice splashes, but ultimately he is never able to look at the big picture: Story, Plot and Character! These are the things that truly determine the strength of a film, everything else is secondary. It\u2019s unfortunate that the action and aesthetics took precedence, but this was decent summer entertainment that should be seen on the big screen.",

      "text": "Man of steel doesn't need the typical introduction that I usually give a film, because this is just a retelling of the original tale. Although the main difference is the villain; who is General Zod, and is told in a different way. I was excited for this movie for a while, but when the trailers started showing up; especially the: \"How does Superman shave?\", I started loosing interest. Seeing in how it looked like it was more focused on visuals than stories, and I wasn't too far off. With that said, this is pretty epic. Of course the visual effects are very pretty to look at, the planet Krypton is both mystic and futuristic. However the effects for the action scenes are the major problems. For a while I enjoyed watching them, but after seeing over a half an hour of superman punching people and them punching back, it gets really old and doesn't look convincing. Mainly the chick that hangs around Zod the most does this sort of super dash, which is annoying. Speaking of Superman, the actor they got was ok. He doesn't do anything that makes him likeable; I'd better explain myself before I get hated. I know he saves people which make him instantly likeable, but he doesn't have a interesting personality. Sure he protects people, but when he's not he is just sort of this serious boring guy. The other actors however were better; in my opinion, especially the guy they got for General Zod. It's a good performance; he does take some traits from the original: Terence Stamp, the character is a bit different though, but for the better I thought. It is strange in how I think they shouldn't have changed Superman's personality and yet changing Zod's is good, but at least here it makes him into an understandable villain. He was raised to be a warrior by the Kyptonian way, and is now protecting the future of the Kryptonian race. Also it's funny that Russel Crowe is like Marlon Brando from the original, in that there big stars only in minor parts, and he does okay. He doesn't take up the scene, but he does have this wise man routine down pretty well. The other supporting cast like Lois are fine; in that she doesn't male any negative impressions, but nothing great. With all that said, I still enjoyed watching this movie. I like the action at certain parts, the drama is good and is even great at times, and the actors do an okay job overall. This is definitely worth your money.",

The opening scene on Krypton actually looked really cool, if you could see it. The cinematography was so shaky that you couldn't actually concentrate on what was happening. I don't mind the dark tone that Snyder takes, but he just can't pull it off. The script was terrible, it became either a laugh or cringe fest whenever anyone opened their mouth. The action looked like a video game, unrealistic, much too fast, and entirely over the top. I don't even want to talk about the science...just awful. And of course, the acting. I love Amy Adams but what the heck? All she did was scream and cry and she was some of the better acting. Russel Crowe was tolerable, Kevin Costner was mediocre, Henry Cavill doesn't pull off the inner struggle that Snyder wants him to have, and everyone else is absolutely horrid. Micheal Shannon was the absolute worst part of the film, and his portrayal of General Zod was soul-less without Superman taking it from him. Do not go and see this unless you enjoy bad movies or have a unique sense of humor. I was lucky that I got my ticket for free, and I'd certainly hate to see anyone actually spend money on this.",

I could go on and write a short story length review of this film and list what's wrong with it but instead I'll just get to the main points.  First, Zack Snyder was a poor choice for director (where is Richard Donner when you need him?).  He is NOT the right director for the character of Superman.  He was great for Watchman but Superman is not anything like WATCHMEN.  Second, the score was AWFUL!  There are no discernible themes for anything in this movie.  Thirdly, the action scenes were WAY over the top and just ridiculous.  This movie was so bad it makes Superman Returns look like a classic and Superman:The Movie look like the best movie of human history (which it almost is!).  Bottom line: don't waste you time on this piece of cinematic garbage.  Especially if you are a fan of Superman.  You WILL be disappointed.  I only hope this movie fails to meet the studio's expectations so we don't see anymore of these abominations!!",

Some of the acting is somewhat wooden and flat, and it jumps from scene to scene, plot point to plot point, rather absent-mindedly and not in a memorable fashion. This results in the film falling down slightly from what it could have been. The fact that this film had Christopher Nolan (of The Dark Knight fame) involved meant that some people were expecting more, another Dark Knight, but that doesn't happen in this film because of the cast, both main and supporting, and the way it casually jumps between plot points without anything really holding them together, making it a rather difficult film to follow. However, on the whole this is a good film and, though it doesn't live up to expectations, it isn't exactly unwatchable and, as well as being a solid entry in the franchise, may very well be one of the best films of the lot.",

      "text": "I walked into this movie with high hopes provided I love a good movie. Being produced by Christopher Nolan and a huge fan of generally speaking all of his work, I really expected alot from this movie. I came in expecting a movie that really dwelved deep into superman's character, but unfortunately none of my hopes manifested themselves. It ended up being a movie where the important character development was explained in its entirety in promotional trailer of the movie. Another problem I had coming into this was  my expectations for a modern superhero movie with semi-interesting plot and some character development, but instead felt as though I was left with 300:Superman Edition. The first 40 minutes kept throwing new information at me that I hoped would go somewhere. Hope that it would become something more, but those hopes quickly died. after the first 40 minutes the movie turns into that epic battle scene that lasts 2 hours too long. Beyond that, the story was faced with many plot holes, a superman that fails to be connected with, an a love interest that feels forced and rather stale. If you go to a movie simply to see a plethora of CGI, by all means, this is the movie for you, but if you are looking for a movie with any level of development your money would be better spent purchasing rope and an afternoon in your garage.",

It focuses too much on being melodramatic and that brings the whole movie down. The action is interesting at times, mostly when Super Man is fighting his foes in mid-air, but ends relying on huge explosions and disasters rather than satisfying fights. It ends up being too noisy both visually and aurally. But by far the worst thing about this movie is how it doesn't feel like a super-hero movie, but rather some generic alien invasion flick. I never cared about what was going on, the characters failed to grab me in any way, and outside of the occasional cool action scene this movie ended up being a waste of time. It's all so disappointing because this was supposed to bring Super Man back with a new tone. If this is how the rest of the Super Man movies are going to turn out they need to just stop now. It even makes me worry that, if one ever gets made, the future Justice League movie will fail.",

The first MoS trailer and the following trailers promised a deep story centered on Clark and his quest on finding his place in the world to ultimately become the savior of humanity, this is what they were teasing in a nutshell. But instead what we got is a glorified Transformers-like movie: no real characters, no deep story, mostly stuff exploding for half the movie. The screenplay is particularly inept, it tries to cram so many insignificant details (do we absolutely need to know what the codex thingy came from or look like for example...) at the expense of smooth transitions (scenes can literally jump from two people in a room to them standing in the desert), character development (the characters are cardboard cut outs, and no, 3 flashbacks of 5 mins are not enough to actually flesh out a character sorry), and most importantly storytelling: indeed the whole movie is constructed like one giant exposition, you spend most of the time catching up on things that already happened instead of having the story naturally unfold before you, and it's not a particularly interesting or original one at that. So in conclusion, my hat's off to the marketing team, because they did a hell of a job hyping up this movie and making it look like something worthy of interest, I just wish the actual filmmakers could have been as competent as them.",

      "text": "Man of Steel is a new reboot for the next Superman series which was done by director, Zack Snyder and the production was hold by Christopher Nolan after he accomplished his Dark Knight trilogy. Before I discuss about the new reboot, this movie is very different like most other classic Superman films. Superman and Superman II are very memorable and most other three Superman movies are quite disappointing and pretty weak. I would say that the movie is very underwhelming. The new story is about Jor-El (Russell Crowe) from Krypton is sending his son Kal-El (known as Clark Kent/Superman) to the planet Earth, which he'll turn into a super strength superhero with energy source, until General Zod (Michael Shannon) will capture the son and the planet Krypton is been destroyed. After that, the son grows up as a new Superman (Henry Cavill) to fight over General Zod and his men to destruct the entire world. As a follow up like most other Superman movies, this movie is pretty weak. The situation is that the story is too complex with too many cut scenes, the acting wasn't that great, and the plot is too rushed. The characters are also forgettable and I would say that the Superman movies or the animated series from the 90's are well done with memorable characters, take time with their motivation, and acting is good. But the new characters in this reboot are too clich\u00e9 with throwing too much stereotypes into a wooden dialogues. Henry Cavill portrays the new Superman is okay, but not that memorable and this protagonist is an obvious hero who is here to find some answers and act like he is brave or what? There is an obvious Lois Lane (Amy Adams), there is an obvious military soldiers, there is an obvious henchmen, and there is an obvious people from the city or in the small town of Smallville. That is except for two characters like Jor-El play by Russell Crowe and General Zod play by Michael Shannon. Russell Crowe did very well as the father of Superman with good character development and some good back story about him. Michael Shannon is having fun for playing the over the top villain and acting like Terrence Stamp's performance. But like I say the story and the characters are kind of bland and too forgettable. The movie is not that horrible or bad, it's just that the movie is too underwhelm with confusing back stories, the shaky cams are too fast, and the characters are pretty weak. At the same time, this movie is a minuscule of average superhero flicks. Thumbs Down.",

The exception being Zod, who was really one-note and shouty, despite having a pretty understandable motivation for doing what he was doing. He could have been an interesting character, but they didn't go that route, which is pretty disappointing. But he wasn't the sole disappointment. Another thing that didn't work for me was the prologue on Krypton. It was too long and way more science fiction-y than I was expecting, criticisms that I suppose could be extended to the entire movie. I'm fine with science fiction, but I really think they should have downplayed some of the alien-ness of Krypton. I don't think we needed Russel Crowe riding around on a dragon. It's already ludicrous enough that they're on a different planet yet are identical to us in appearance. You don't need to highlight that by showing the vastly different morphology of Krypton's wildlife. Makes suspension of disbelief a good deal harder. And to be honest, I'm not sure what level of reality they're shooting for in this movie. By making Lois aware of Superman's identity, they've basically conceded that it would be ludicrous for her to be fooled by a pair of glasses. But what about the rest of the world? We see in the last scene that he's working at the Daily Planet (It's real easy to become a reporter at a major metropolitan publication, right?). Not the sort of below-the-radar drifting that he had been doing previously. Seems like just about anyone who has seen Clark and Superman would put two and two together. And I know this is an inherited piece of ridiculousness. It's from the comic books, it's from the previous movies, and they couldn't tear everything to the ground. But the reason it wasn't an issue in previous media (I can only speak for the films as I've not read the comic books), is that they always had an air of campiness to them. Suspending your disbelief wasn't hard because it was clear that the world of Superman didn't really operate on anything resembling real world logic. That's not the case in the dour, self-serious world of Man of Steel. I feel like Superman's identity would be known in about 5 seconds flat. Okay, I'm out of good transitions, so another thing that bothered me was Pa Kent's death. I get that he didn't want his son to reveal himself by saving him, but why didn't he just let Clark get the dog in the first place? He could've done that without raising suspicions. It was just kind of a clumsy way of setting up his death. Also, though I liked Superman and Lois on their own, I thought they had very little chemistry together and their kiss was completely unearned. I'm sure there were other things that bothered me, but I'm not thinking of them right now.",

Unfortunately, the film suffers from a number of technical shortcomings that may break the experience for some. After the film's opening sequence on Krypton, the Man of Steal focuses on Clark's journey to find a place in the only world he has ever known. To show the hardships that young Clark endured, flashbacks are used, generally showing different points in Clark's youth as he struggled to deal with his differences. The film then jumps back to adult Clark, as he wonders the United States, looking for some clue as to his origins and what his purpose in life may be. While both the past and present stories are interesting, the movie never stops to allow the audience time to really take in what is happening on screen. The scenes between young Clark and his Earth father are particularly endearing, but the audience is never really afforded time to absorb and appreciate the importance of their relationship. Instead, viewers are allowed a small sequence of dialogue, before they are jarred back in the present where adult Clark is in a completely different situation than he was the last time we saw him. In fact, the film plays leap frog over itself through half of the movie, trying to tell two stories at the cost of making both of them feel hollow.",

The acting was solid and holds the movie together and the cast deserves praise especially Antje Traue who completely stole it for me, while it would make a great blu-ray movie I cannot say this was the rip roaring summer blockbuster it was meant to be and if they didn't fill so much in so little time it would of made a great superman movie  however my biggest memory of this movie was the debris factor so much flew around i couldn't make out what was happening to whom and where and since superman is about action i felt quite disappointed in what should be its strongest sequences and scenes the biggest problem is reviewing what is most likely going to be a series of movies and the development of Louis and Superman or Clark Kent not alot was hit upon on its starting settings which will be built upon in its blatant sequels. This isn't a bad movie but it isn't the new awesome superman that seemed to be promised this isn't what the dark knight movies did for batman but its not to far off but if a definitive sequel is made it will have to surely deliver more or suffer the same fate as the transformers.",

So I have to say Man of Steel had something to prove. The film tells the story of what happens when far away planet Krypton starts dying and Jor-El (Russell Crowe) sends his son Kal-El (Henry Cavill) to Earth so he may live. When he arrives he is raised in secret by Jonathan (Kevin Costner) and Martha Kent (Diane Lane) and learns to become a hero people can believe in as reporter Lois Lane (Amy Adams) gets closer to uncovering the truth behind this mysterious hero's true identity. The feeling I had when I left the cinema was one of disappointment sure but not for the reasons I expected. I expected an emotionless sequence of beautifully framed rubbish, what I got was so much more than that. Man of Steel is excellent science fiction, its smart, its beautifully realized and it shows a part of Superman's mythology that has never really been touched upon by the films. It's a good 30 minutes before we are introduced to the titular hero as we see the collapse of Krypton and how their society broke down enough for Jor-El to send Kal to Earth in the first place. The rest of the film is a pretty conventional origins story but unlike Zach Snyder's previous films Watchmen and Sucker Punch, Man of Steel has an understanding of its characters and the emotions that drive them and brings out some excellent performances in Henry Cavill, Russell Crowe, Kevin Costner and Michael Shannon as fellow Kryptonian and lead villain General Zod. The film looks brilliant, it tells a captivating story and it has well thought out characters except for Adams' Lois Lane who pales in comparison to Margot Kidder's interpretation of the woman (although Adams is better than Kate Bosworth's version of the character but that's not hard as a reasonably well trained dog could play her better than Bosworth did.) The main downside however is not an acting problem its the films ending, not for the surprise twist I imagine a lot of people are talking about  but because that final hour is just a long sequence of destruction that could be 20 minutes shorted and would still bore me to death. The action looks good and in sections of the film when there is actual story its good to see it accompany the story but the end of the film lacks any real reason for this ridiculous over the top violence and the story is nowhere as strong as it is in the first hour and a half. In fact that was my main qualm, the fact that the first hour and a half, the tale of how Clark Kent becomes Superman is almost perfect Sci-Fi and it is almost ruined by a blockbuster ending, a conclusion based on what other blockbuster superheroes have done recently and not what this character should do, something Snyder should have picked up on but unfortunately didn't.",

She knows that he has super powers from the night she meets him, and she knows him as Clark soon after.  Also, the two of them had little dialogue during the movie, so it was weird when they got together at the end.  I kept thinking \"but you don't even really know her...\" and we really didn't as the audience either.  We got the Kal-El/Clark Kent backstory, but other than that, there was little character development.  They didn't feel like real people we cared about.  This movie focused a lot on action and didn't have time for dialogue or characters...and some people like the action scenes, but I personally am not into that.  I care more about the characters and that they have believability as real people.  One of the critiques I hear a lot from people comparing super heroes is that they don't like superman because he's too perfect and inhuman.  This movie has more of a gritty, dark Clark Kent, so I guess he's more human in a way, but he seemed like a cold, brooding jerk, and not like someone I wanted to know.

The back-story was very well done and touching in parts, but the lack of a real-time plot (they find him, a fight ensues, earth is saved) prevents it from paying off.  This would have worked better as two separate movies  one about the destruction of Krypton and the hunt for a new planet (including the show-down with Kal-El), and another with Superman discovering his place on earth.

I am criticizing the movie alone. Although i knew it was directed by Snyder so I didn't expect much. I went to the theater with some friends thinking it would just be another average action movie and it was just that. However what I don't like about these average action movies is that they are bad. They have a weak plot, weak character development and are so full of nonsense. Those movies are just money machines. They have good SFX which can be showcased in the trailer to attract the audience but always fail to deliver. No wonder nearly half of the budget goes into marketing. Producers don't want to invest in an original or creative approach, that's too risky and why should they? People still paid to go, so did I. When you look at these years' big budget movies you'll see that they are either sequels, prequels, spin-offs, adaptations, remakes....etc. No original story. Man of Steel fits perfectly this section. Why bother making a good movie if it will sell anyway? This seems to be Hollywood's guideline nowadays. In conclusion, nearly no character development, boring dialogues, weak reused plot with many inconsistencies and holes, good to average imagery and average action. 4 out of 10.",

However, I will say that it does try to do a lot and struggles from typical origin story pitfalls.

Superman is supposed to do everything he can to keep the innocent people safe (to the point of risking his own life), but in this movie he did not seem to care at all. Overall the plot is hardly immersing and the actress that played Lois was a horrible choice. It's an \"ok\" movie like most Superman movies, but not great.",

However, as the movie demonstrated, the premise of portraying Superman in a serious and dramatic tone turned out to be a completely ludicrous idea given the inherent camp of the source material. The Man of Steel has always been the most comically overpowered and cheesy superhero. It simply doesn't make sense to place such a dramatic tone on this kind of story. It might have worked had it been handled by a more capable screenwriter, since the wooden nature of the dialogue and terrible characterization of everyone including Superman/Clark Kent himself. Not to mention a very thin plot and overindulgent violence and destruction that bored the audience to death by taking up the final forty five minutes of the film only to lead to an unsatisfying and anticlimactic final act. This colossal movie that was a colossal bummer.",

Maybe a real hardcore comic book nerd might rejoice in the details (origins and technical jargon) but I thought it went WAY overboard. Chris Nolan is a genius. If anyone could've breathed life back into this tired franchise, it would be him. He failed (at least in my opinion and by the low critic ratings.) So, it begs the question--Is this comic book character on his way out? My only saving hope is the fact that The Dark Knight was far and away a much better movie than Batman begins. However, Batman begins was a really good movie. The Man of Steel was not! I'm rooting for the next one to be good. Perhaps, they should stop promoting and teasing these flicks a year prior to releasing them. It would not have made this a better movie, but at the very least we might not feel such a strong sense of deceipt. I know the promos for The Dark knight began long before it's premeire date, but I was unaware of the movie until I saw the trailer when I went to see the first installment of Ironman. When I went back to the theatre about a month later, I had fairly modest expectations and was Blown Away by the greatest comic book movie ever. Of course you can't replicate the success of the Dark Knight just by limiting the exposure, but I think some lower expectations would work wonders! There were many things wrong with the Man of Steel. It was a bit scattershot, trying to tell an origins story and everything else all at once. For what it's worth, I found the psychogy of the young Clark Kent to be somewhat fascinating at times, and would have liked to have seen more of that. I don't like the fact that perhaps the most physically imposing villian of the franchise was trotted out in the first film (and there will BE another film!) Lex Luther is a criminal mastermind, but not super human. Come to think of it that may be the achilles heal of all superman movies. This character only has one weakness and it SHOULD be more difficult to come by. He could easily defeat any other super hero on the planet. So throwing out his only Kryptonian enemy in the first film may have been premature. I can't help but think their may have been a better way to execute it, but it's useless now since the fight is over and (SPOILER ALERT!!!)...Superman won! As I said before Chris Nolan is a genius. Despite this flop, there's still no one I'd rather see directing these movies. I will be rooting for him to have lightning struck twice in his 2nd effort. Well, That is if he is in fact the one directing it!",

      "text": "Great cast, brilliant effects, bad plot. Man of Steel is a rather generic superhero movie. We see his origins and randomly dive into the future, then constantly back and forth to his childhood and back to a fully grown Kal-El. It would've been interesting to see if the movie had actually brought these flashbacks in randomly for a reason, but unfortunately, the flashbacks usually happen and are then completely forgotten about. The writing also consistently talks about how special Superman is to the world, it's the only thing they ever seem to talk about throughout the entire movie leaving very little time for character development. While the ending is what most fans tend to rip apart, to me it seemed an interesting take on the dark role Superman now has to take in this much more serious adaptation of the comic books. Superman is put to the true test of questioning what is truly right and if he has the courage to pay the price to save the planet he was raised on. I felt this was the strong point of the movie, there should've been more focus on it. However, I found Johnathan Kent in this movie to be extremely frustrating. He often told Clark to do one thing, then sometime later he'd say to do the exact opposite. Like in the flashback when Clark saves kids from drowning in his school bus, one minute John tells Clark he could let them die to keep his identity safe, then he shows him the ship he arrived in and tells him 'You're the answer to \"Are we alone in the universe?\" and describes how big a change he will make to the world when he reveals himself, then in a later flashback he tells him he should never reveal himself and become a farmer as he is, *spoiler* his demise is pointless and feels terribly done as Superman reveals himself a few years later. Some see the point of what Johnathan was telling Superman, but I struggle to understand why he told him so many different things at once. The action sequences are gripping and blood pumping, this makes them extremely enjoyable to watch for any Superman fan, but these can't be used to sugarcoat the whole movie. Promotions are also used all the way through, for example when Superman and Zod fly into Sears for no apparent reason, it just demonstrates advertisers desperation to promote their products. Overall, the film isn't terrible, but neither is it the masterpiece it was promising many hopeful movie goers. It gives me very little hope for the Justice League movie (if it ever actually happens) if the makers keep following this formula.",

This really is superman redesigned, if your a fan of the old superman and come here expecting the old superman, then your probably going to leave the cinema feeling disappointed. On the other hand, look at it in a brand spanking new superman and the effect is quite different. The story was basic but well delivered, but the narration could have used abit of work. Some characters didn't feel at all fleshed out and kind of bland at times, even superman himself at times. The biggest and liveliest character of the film was supermans enemy, Zod. Simply put, one of the best villains in a hero movie ever. Infact saying he was a villain would be almost unfair, if you actually get inside Zod's mind, you see that he isn't doing the things out of pure evil nature but for the good of his race and that is what he has been born for. I give this film a very strong 7 or a 7.5 if the rating system had it.",

The Christopher Nolan touch is apparent in the quality of the film's production, but not in it's plot. Furthermore, at times the dialogue descends into superhero movie clich\u00e9, none of which is as rewarding as it is in say, the Tobey Maguire Spiderman series. Aside from this, the film makes for an enjoyable watch, with some genuinely moving, epic and humourous moments, and it provides an excellent platform for what could be a fitting followup series to the Dark Knight trilogy in the DC Universe.",

      "text": "Man of Steel was good, no doubt, but I still left the theater somewhat unsatisfied. Why? Well, its hard to say really... most of my criticisms about the movie are nit-picky and circumstantial. A great amount of time was spent on a reinvented Krypton, introducing fans to new concepts about Superman's back-story, and providing rich content for those less avid superman fans, that is, until  Krypton is destroyed and a young Kal-El is shipped off to Earth. There the story becomes a little convoluted. An adult Kal-El is now, all of a sudden introduced to the story, and what little information is provided about his childhood is presented in the form of flashbacks. While personally, I would have liked to see a bit more development in this area, I suppose it probably couldn't have been done much better. I mean, entire comic books and even a television series have been based solely on his adolescence. Proper development in this area would have taken another movie, and well, put simply, \"aint nobody got time for that\". The overall presentation of the movie was absolutely stunning, and Snyder does an excellent job of displaying Kryptonian power to scale, on Earth. The acting was pretty decent as well. It would be hard to not to with such a cast. Henry Cavill did an excellent job of portraying Superman's overall demeanor, almost seeming very Christopher Reeve like in is interpretation of the character. All in all, the only real complain I have about the movie was the lack of character development. If Lois Lane had died in the movie, not a tear would have been shed in the audience, simply because not enough time was spent developing her story, or anyone else's. Doing so, however, would have been a monumental task. This movie done right, would have been two different movies. So, in that sense the \"Man of Steel\" franchise seems a little incomplete. There is talk of a sequel, maybe then we'll see what this story, and this version of Superman is REALLY all about.",

Although the final act may be too reminiscent of Avengers Assemble, Man of Steel is well made and well played, especially by Crowe and Costner as the fathers.

One of the film's greatest attributes is the decisions and directions it takes in how to tell this iconic story. However the same cannot be said about the execution of these great ideas as there is not enough time given to develop them further. Once Kal-El finally puts on the suit things really start to pick up and the action really is outstanding despite occasionally dragging on for too long particularly in the final fight. Another gripe I had with the film is that there are only about four characters that get enough screen time and development which leaves actors such as Lawrence Fishburne not getting a chance to shine. All performances are good in this film and Henry Cavill does a great job in the lead but Russell Crowe's Jor-El is an obvious stand out here. Man of Steel is a good and much needed reboot of Superman that keeps the majority of the audience entertained. Despite a few flaws that hold the film back from being truly great Man of Steel is certainly lots of fun and could definitely be the launching pad for a franchise",

There were tons of explosions and destroyed buildings and I just thought that is mainly where the film was struggling, just trying to do way too much at the end. So the beginning was going well but that ending is kind of what killed the movie overall for me. However, it may just be because I'm not much of a Superman fan; so I'll leave it up to you to decide whether you should see this movie or not.",

Man of Steel is a decent popcorn flick, but it really lacks the substance to make it anything more than that.",

      "text": "This is perhaps the best film to introduce the modern audience to Superman. Gripping straight from the start, Man of Steel takes the audience from the new and improved Krypton to the revised childhood of Clark Kent to his first climactic encounter with his titular nemesis Zod. It does everything right in a reboot, and it does it exceptionally well. Zack Snyder's choice for more graphical/ stylistic cinematography more akin to the comics is well implemented and brings back the strength of Superman. Cavill's portrayal of the beginning superhero is near perfect. Casting choices were great albeit character relations seemed a tad off. Despite this, the action never ceases to be engaging and fight scenes were amazingly done on a massive scale. I believe that this movie is extraordinarily underrated as it is able to capture the essence of the modern Superman perfectly. We get to see more of Kent's backstory as well as a more emotional take on the characters around him. The lack of a solid relationship with Amy Adam's character is preferred but not necessarily essential as it has been thoroughly established by the past few films. Overall, this is a magnificent start to the DCEU and sets the stage for the (also excellent) Batman v Superman. There can always be parts that can be be improved upon, but for now this is the best introduction to the modern Superman anyone can get. More emotional than the stiff Superman Returns, while also packing the action nessecary to captivate this ages audience. I think Man of Steel should be the standing example of what a good superhero film should be today. Side Note: When in comparison to films like The Dark Knight, it obviously isn't as well crafted but I'd like to think that TDK Trilogy is in a league of its own.",

Not the best material for Michael Shannon but it seems like he could\u00b4ve done something more giving Zod more character or memorable things to do or say. The movie is a solid 8 but has problems in the story and the way approaching it. For a 2:20 hs of a film, they put together a lot of things for the future.

Although Zack Snyder clearly has problems directing and I'm glad Ben Affleck is there to maybe talk some sense into him when he gets to excited and forgets to explain things such as why Lois is so important to Zod in this movie to the point where he demands to have her in this ship. Check it out if you're a DC fan or a Superman fan or watch it with some friends if you want to see a dumb action film.",

      "text": "This review contains spoilers, click expand to view. Zack Snyder's first outing with the DC Cinematic Universe shows some promise but it also faces major stumbling blocks. This reboot tries to depict a more humanized Superman as he tries to be the ultimate bridge between Earth and Krypton. I admire the film for its ambition and there are some good elements that are unfortunately balanced out by serious problems. The film is not your typical Superman movie for better and worse. For instance the entire movie is tinted in a greyish- blue kind of color which sucks the life out of the frame. This choice is supposed to reflect the somber mood but there is barely a balance of life in the frame. Another major failing on the technicals is the excessive use of Shaky cam. There are some scenes when it is called for such as Superman flying for the first time and a few of the crashes but there are other scenes when the shaky cam is used during quiet scenes. It especially got bad during the one scene when Johnathan Kent was trying to teach Clark a life lesson and the shaky cam got in the way of me trying to connect with the scene. On that note, Kevin Kosner played the worst portrayal of Johnathan Kent to this date as he is very apathetic and even encouraged his son to let his classmates die. Lois Lane appears to only be in this film out of obligation since her contribution to the film was very limited at best. Superman himself is very emotional detached and is reckless in his actions causing so much collateral damage that it would even make Michael Bay blush. General Zod is the one character who appears to have some depth to him as he wants to save Krypton at the cost of all life on Earth. The biggest scene that caused controversy is the scene when Superman snaps Zod's neck. This act goes against everything that the character stands for. Superman is a character that represents the best of humanity and he is a character who shows mercy to his enemies as he fights for everyone. This moment could have worked if the film had better established Superman's moral code against killing but it was never built up to that point. A better example of a hero who had to make a moral compromise by going against his no-killing code was Trigun. Trigun was an aneme that heavily establishes Vash's qualm against killing and thus it had more of an impact when he finally had to take a life to save his friends. In this film's case however, the emotional impact of Superman's actions are never brought up again. Despite these glaring issues there are some good elements in this film. The opening scene on Krypton was well done as it shows the despair of the Kryptonions in their inevitable doom. The relationship with Clark and Martha Kent is also well done as she teaches Clark how to focus his powers. In short I do see how people enjoy this film but I cannot. This is a potentially profound film that doesn't live up to its potential. Collapse",

      "text": "Man of Steel represents the latest attempt by Warner Brothers to revive a Superman franchise that, since its stunning 1978 revival, has been abominably treated for about 30 years (ever since Richard Donner was unceremoniously fired from Superman II). This movie certainly looks and feels a lot different than any of its predecessors, and that's not just because of the crappy 3-D. It's more of a science fiction/fantasy adventure than a superhero movie. In a way that's good, because it doesn't come across like a tired retread of every origin story we've ever seen. On the other hand, it's not good, because the sci-fi feel has been overly influenced by the likes of Independence Day and Transformers. That's right: blow everything up, real good! Pyrotechnics! Special Effects! CGI up the wazoo! For those who crave cinematic mayhem, Man of Steel is right up your alley (and it will make a ton of money). But something important has been lost along the way: heart. This is a cold, sterile motion picture. The characters are so thinly drawn that it's tough to get much feel for them. And one senses that director Zack Snyder is less interested in Superman than he is in the orgy of destruction he gets to rain down on Metropolis. Somewhere, Roland Emmerich and Michael Bay are smiling.",

Now after seeing it multiple times and as a few years have passed I absolutely love this movie.  There will always be parts that could have been done a little better, but over all this is the best superman adaption ever brought to the big screen.  The music is great, the thought put into the villain and their motivations is great, the thought put into superman feeling like an alien and coming to grips with this is great, and the action is amazing if a bit much at times in the end but what do you expect from Snyder.  Easily in my top 5 favorite super hero movies.",

I liked the structure, it mixed things up a bit but was entirely coherent. It looks gorgeous, of course. The performances are universally good. Zod is threatening but you can see why he does what he does. Clark and Superman are beautifully portrayed by Henry Cavill. I love the uncertainty he brings to early Superman. The Smallville action scene is genuinely awesome. On the downside, the climax is mis-judged, not because of the amount of death and destruction but it's just too long and the CGI grates. The scene on board the Kryptonion ship is a bit hokey. But I do believe this to be in the top three super-hero movies ever made.",

The story, the visual, and the action choreography (was 1 of the best for a superhero movie). I remember when fans would complain that Superman was a boring character because not anyone can take him on, so the director had him take on General Zod & kneel before him. Henry Cavill is my favorite Superman to date.",
