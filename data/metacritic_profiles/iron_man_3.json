Yes, there are a ton of Ironman suits, but Tony Stark spends more time being James Bond than Ironman.  The emotions and stress that Stark is dealing with is interesting, and the subtle references to The Avengers is good, but other than that, this movie had no real depth at all.  The motives for the bad guys is not really evident, nor is the explanation of the extremis virus.  One minute you have a glowing man turning into a bomb and the next you have 10 glowing guys who breathe fire and regenerate except when killed?!?!?!?!  All the Ironman suits were cool but how they get to that point is pretty pointless.  It was an ok movie, and probably better than the second one, but was more of a money grab than a great film.",

The villains are always so underdeveloped or underused to the point of asking, who is Iron Man fighting?  After ruining Whiplash who was perfectly cast, they completely ruined Mandarin.  I'm not a huge comic buff but I know enough to realize it was done poorly.  That doesn't make the review though, the movie as a movie just wasn't good regardless.  The run time of two hours and fifteen minutes felt like four hours and thirty minutes.  There were a lot of parts that just didn't seem to matter.  Additionally, there was a lot of screen time of Iron Man not being Iron Man.  Where Tony Stark would sneak around like beloved secret agent 007 but I felt it really didn't fit the character.  Especially since it didn't make any sense as later in the film we discover he had fifty Iron Man suits waiting under his house.  Instead he decides to fix up the 42 and fight the baddies in human skin.  The reason I disliked him being out of the suit is because we know he isn't trained like Batman/Bruce Wayne, Iron Man is the suit.  On the topic of things not mattering, Mandarin attacking Iron Man's home.  We all know he has a huge ego and endangered those he loved but of course being a super hero movie, nothing significant happened.  We see that suits are blowing up but later in the film Jarvis commands like fifty more that are unharmed.  The hero of the movie is Jarvis, his AI Jeeves.  And this begs the question, if those suits were dormant underneath his house, why didn't he just call upon them while he was stranded in Tennessee?  I guess there wouldn't be a movie then, right?",

      "text": "When it comes to Iron Man, or any Marvel movie for that matter, I'm skeptical. They can be really good like: Spiderman; The Avengers and X-men or utter  like Thor; The Hulk or Elektra. Iron Man to me is a mixed bag in that it can be good or mediocre. I personally disliked the first one and loved the second. What about this Iron Man movie how did it fair. I mean when we went to see it the tickets were sold out. Thankfully we wisely bought our tickets online unlike some people. Anyway the movie, was it truly the summer blockbuster we were waiting for? Was it truly a perfect movie like we had thought? NO! It wasn't, it really wasn't. Does that mean it was bad? Well no it was, OK. I won't completely spoil the story, but in my opinion it was an excuse plot that ties in with the Avengers movie(which by the way is referenced a lot in this movie). I really did not find the story very interesting, at all. Like I said, it is an excuse plot, there is nothing you can't predict, save for one scene. The slower scenes in the movie really offset the more action oriented scenes, to the point of being boring. I'm serious you are gonna be think can these people shut up and get to the action already. Oh by the way, I hope you like Deus Ex Machina's cause this movie has a metric  ton of them. There were plenty of times where I went \"oh Bull****\". Robert Downey, Jr. reprises his role as Tony Stark Iron Man and as always he does an excellent job in this role. He really brings life to an otherwise lifeless movie. As always he really gets into character and has fun with it and in turn we have fun too. What about the other character? Well, for the most part, they kinda suck. Don Cheadle as James \"Rhodey\" Rhodes aka Iron Patriot(what a stupid name) is in the movie but barely does anything. Gwyneth Paltrow as Virginia \"Pepper\" Potts is just there to get captured, that's it. The kid, well I hate kids in action movies, so there is your answer .What about The Mandarin? Let me answer that in a question. WHAT THE  DID THEY DO TO THE MANDARIN?!! The Mandarin has always been one of my favorite marvel villains, so when I learned he would be the main villain I was hyped. When he is revealed he looks and sounds awesome and in scene in the movie where we see how cruel he is, I thought I can't wait to see him fight. So disappointed was I, because HE'S NOT EVEN THE MAIN VILLAIN! What they did to such a cool villain was downright criminal and I know I sound like a crazed fan boy, but when I saw the real villain it was impossible to not be aggravated. Seriously the writers thought the villain reveal was clever, but it was so obvious to anyone who graduated 6th grade. So the story suck, most of the characters were lame, but what about the the action and effect were they at least good? Actually they were. The suit were pretty well made, granted I am well aware that they were cgi, but the get the job done. The action was definitely great even when Iron man didn't have his suit, he was still awesome. I won't give it away but the final action scene was one of the greatest things ever, however I can't help but feel Iron Man gets his ass kick just a little too much, but the scenes are still memorable. Finally let me warn you, do not sit through the credits! All you will get is a shameless, shoehorn cameo and the most insulting sequel set up ever! In fact it isn't even a sequel set up, because the writers thought it would be awesome to blatantly tell you that \"Tony Stark will return\" for another cash-in. Wow!  you guys. With that being said the final score for Iron Man 3 is a 6/10 it's decent. The action and effect is what you came for and you get it. The movie also had genuinely funny jokes and like I said Robert Downey, Jr. is a joy in this movie as he normally is. However the other characters and story gravely missed their marks.",

The story takes place where Iron Man/Tony Stark fights over Mandarin to assassinate the president with his reinforce baddies. Robert Downey Jr. returns as Tony Stark known as Iron Man is planning to make a new magnetize costume to suit it up, but overall he needs to spend time with his girlfriend (Gwyneth Paltrow) in the holidays. The two main villains are Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) and Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce) are making an evil plan to kill Iron Man and to kill the president, but not Mandarin its Killian. The action scenes are spectacular and the effects are well done, but the only two good parts in this movie was Iron Man saves the passengers from the sky and Iron Man faces Killian at the docks with full of Iron suits. I would say that Shane Black did very well with the action scenes and the effects are good, but overall the movie wasn't that spectacular like most other Iron Man movies or even classic The Avengers. My main problem is that characters are a little bit too much, the lines are off charted, and sometimes it\u2019s okay to check out the action scenes. It just difference between Stark with his girlfriend, Stark get complain with the little boy, Stark didn't realize that his old girlfriend works with Killian, or even the villain like Mandarin was a goof ball pretending a bad guy and just a fraud actor, but it needs to rewrite the lines and the story needs to take it seriously.

Trouble is, for starters its running time is a flabby 2hrs 15 mins, easily 30 mins too long, the villains are largely uninteresting, and for an Iron Man movie, he's hardly suited up for the first hour of the movie! Thankfully Downey Jnr and Paltrow still have a great chemistry, effects and action sequences, when thy finally turn up, are excellent, but compared to last years \"Marvels The Avengers\" this is still a\u00a0good, but on the whole, pretty average comic book action movie.",

      "text": "Some might argue that Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) is more himself in this film than in any of his others. I unfortunately am not one of them and while Iron Man 3 is a solid film, it doesn't really fell like Iron Man was even in it. The plot revolves around what happens when a close friend of Tony's is caught up in a terror attack orchestrated by a villain called The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley). Tony heads on a journey of vengeance and re discovery as those he left behind are targeted in his stead. Like the Avengers did, Iron Man 3 takes a large portion of its opening to re-introduce the characters in Tony's world from Gwyneth Paltrow's Pepper Potts to Don Cheadle's James 'Rhodie' Rhodes, but unlike The Avengers it drags. The labored opening gives way to a 2nd act so fantastically funny it doesn't seem to belong to the same film. Shane Black brings his signature black comedy to the Iron Man universe and while making this world a lot more interesting than Iron Man 2 it does remove that familiar Stark feel. In fact it feels more like Harry Lockhart (also played by Downey in Shane Blacks's Kiss Kiss Bang Bang) has replaced the troubled hero with his own overly narcissistic, sarcastic and all around vulgar self. The only character who seems to maintain their identity in this film is Rhodie who is just as fun loving as he was in Iron Man 2. In fact the replacement of Terrence Howard for Don Cheadle has proven pretty successful as he is much more accessible a character now. The main detractor from Iron Man 3 is that it doesn't really feel like the Iron Man from The Avengers or Iron Man, he seems to be just as likable but this film doesn't really live up to the character that has been built over the span of 4 films. Another problem is that the film relies heavily on the relationship between Stark and Potts and Gwyneth Paltrow just seems bored this time around. Her scenes drag, her delivery is flat and she doesn't put any effort in. The middle section which coincidentally is almost Paltrow free allows Downey to shine with the whip smart dialog and the introduction of a small boy named Harley (Ty Simpkins) is ingenious because he is almost a mini Stark but with a little more compassion. They interact in an almost brotherly way and you really understand why these two interact so well, they are both really well fleshed out and both deliver some killer lines (Simpkins has one line that is so completely unexpected and hilarious it almost makes up for the slow open). Iron Man 3 while chock full of action is ultimately a comedy film with a very lighthearted tone. The film flounders when the jokes aren't flying so even the action, which looks fantastic, is lacking something. The finale shows that Black can direct a big budget actioner but it just seems like a little too much for a film that feels like a stand alone but is trying to be a conclusion of a trilogy. Finally despite the great Downey performance the best comes from Kingsley who is not only the perfect villain but has a chameleon quality that allows him to be anyone, if anything you should go to see it for him and him alone.",

The villain was thankfully not a robot and had some depth as well, which was one of the biggest things Iron Man 2 lacked. There was also plenty of humor, actually, there was more humor than the first two combined and almost all of it felt well timed and fit into the flow of the film. There were a few jokes or quips that felt forced but for the most part there were a lot of laughs to go around. The only real area of weakness for the movie were the overpowered villains. *SPOILER* The villains were so OP it made watching certain battle sequences a little ridiculous. It shouldn't take several Mark suits to take out one of the villains henchmen. And like in the second film, their powers have a limited range (whip in part 2, the need to touch you in this one) so them being capable of going toe-to-toe, let alone overtake a Mark suit was kind of a joke.

Niente da dire, invece, sugli effetti speciali, che per una volta non sono curati dalla Industrial Light & Magic: notevoli anche se tirate un po\u2019 per le lunghe (il prezzo da pagare alle copie in 3D?) sono sia la distruzione della villa di Stark, sia il gran finale nel porto, in cui, seppure a fatica, infine defunge il cattivone di turno  Guy Pearce comincia ad essere abbonato ai ruoli di villain.

Packing all the quick wit and explosive action that's become trademark of this series, this third and highly-anticipated outing sees Tony Stark at his most vulnerable as he fights stoically and sometimes desperately against the will of a mysterious terrorist known as the Mandarin after his home is destroyed. Featuring some great new side characters and welcome old ones, this film definitely ups the scope of Iron Man while retaining the same charm of the others, and is a great piece of entertainment. The only big flaw it has is in its mid-movie twist, which reveals the Mandarin as nothing more than an actor and facade for the true villain, who is both much less intimidating and far more standardized (especially when being played by Guy Pearce). This move might not be quite so deflating if it weren't also for the fact that this character quickly becomes not only a shattered echo of the awesome Mandarin we've been expecting to see, but simply a drugged-up comic relief. It didn't completely ruin the movie for me, but I would have much rather seen a showdown between Stark and Mandarin than Stark and Guy Pearce, particularly since you fully believe beforehand that it was this Mandarin who blew up his house and almost killed Pepper Potts. But despite this, it's definitely worth seeing and definitely worth the title of \"Iron Man\". Another solid entry from Marvel.",

Most of the movie is spent with back story for iron man and figuring out what the main villain is doing. I loved the main villain he was very clever and you never knew what the was going to do next, if only iron man could fight him back or at least try seriously it's a little pathetic when your girlfriend defeats the main villain for you. During the whole course of the movie Iron man kills maybe 1 of the actual bad guys, just because your trying to make the story more serious doesn't mean you have to make him a freaking pansy. You had all this build up leading to the end and then he doesn't even kill the main villain. The movie is also filled with lots of humor which is appreciated these movies need more humor but I wish the movie was more focused on the villain than back story and humor because that's what made these movies in the first place!",

IronMan 3 is a much more mature film for the most part, with a story that feels relevant and a focus on Tony Stark rather than IronMan. I particularly liked the fact that Tony was suffering PTSD after the events of the Avengers. In the end this pays off somewhat leading to a great story for Tony and pretty much no one else. The special and practical effects in this film were awesome particularly the getting in and out of the suits and the plane sequence stunt is great to watch.

My reason for this is Ben Kingsley's performance in the transmission interruptions were frighteningly impressive and an actor of that stature should not have been so sorely misused. On the contrary, Stark's interactions with Harley were a high point of the film as were the special effects, and the post-credit scene with Dr. Banner was a nice touch.

Though this movie didn't really have a climax it still had a good Suits vs Monster scene. Would have been better if they concentrated on that fight than the Tony fight but its still good. They showed some tidbits of it. Overall a good movie.",

      "text": "This movie IS NOT a direct adaption of either the Extremis or Mandarin story lines. And that is by no means a bad thing. I feel that anybody giving this movie a poor score does not understand the point of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It is it's own universe, and doesn't completely follow the comics. Get over it. Yes, the comics are fantastic, but expecting these movies to have those exact same characters, story lines, and style is simply setting yourself up for disappointment. I will admit that the movie's biggest plot twist was a momentary let down for me. But then I began thinking, and realized how clever, risky, and bold it was of Marvel to do what they did. It froze the plot for a scene or two, but the rest of the movie easily regained that momentum. These movies are meant to be witty, action-packed entertainment. They've always been among the best as far as action movies go, and I for one was not disappointed by this movie. It was sweet to see Tony Stark in action outside of his suit, Guy Pierce and Ben Kingsley were great (while not spectacular) villains, and the plot twist may have been strange, but it certainly is not the movie breaking tragedy that fans are making it out to be. This movie has layers of greatness to it, and it's a shame to see people walk away disappointed from this film because they forget that it was exactly that; a film, and not an adapted motion comic. The Mandarin from the comics would not have fit to the Marvel Cinematic Universe at this point in its cycle, and the way they handled him was shocking and daring, but never felt disappointing. Accept this movie as its own creation, and if you've enjoyed the rest of these films, you will undoubtedly love it.",

The tonal shifts, absurd plotting and the sheer level of disrespect for the source material (for all the geeks who care) made this summer blockbuster a piping hot mess, indeed. Our new director on board is Shane Black and I must admit he did pretty good job in the way of characterizations in the first half of this flick. Tony's post traumatic stress disorder, from the events of 'The Avengers', was developing well. But, as the second half rolled in, things drastically change from being a character-centric event to a bloated non-stop action fest, which, mind you, wasn't even creatively staged. There seems to be a belief that more plot equals better story, but that bombardment of ineffective plot twists only regressed the story at hand. Being so focused on surprising the audience, I don\u2019t think the writers were ever fully capable of telling a solid story and polishing the muddy motives of our paper thin villain. And I can\u2019t leave here without mentioning those perennial bursts of \u201chumor\u201d which only functioned to pull the audience out of key dramatic moments. Overall the movie relied so heavily on build up but ultimately undid itself in several ways. This really showed how hollow this shiny hunk of metal really was.",

Having seen it, I was frankly struck with unpredictability and originality of the movie and the game of actors. As I liked dynamism of actions, there were no boring monologues and the memoirs of the past which have bothered with everything of reasonings on life and threats from enemies of the main character. Each shot of work opened to me something new. As an example  new scenes of relationship between the main and minor characters. Remember, at least, Harley's fascinating company and \"mechanic\". Where you still similar saw? Interaction of two of these children was simple a masterpiece. Thaw I was as if Tony's reflection in the childhood, it appeared its copy.

Plus I know they acknowledged the Avengers several times, but with all Tony went through (even being presumed dead) your telling me not one of the Avengers would show up to help.  I can understand no Hulk with all the destruction and unpredictability he brings and I can understand no Thor as he's hanging out on another planet, but we couldn't see Captain America or Hawkeye or finally Black Widow she was in the entire second one.

Tony Stark's journey from Iron Man 1 is somewhat complete, and I do like how they try to depict a man with PTSD post-Avengers, and how he tries to plan ahead and cope with it. However halfway through, it seems that this arc somehow dropped off the radar, and reached a conclusion without ever seeing any sort of resolution. It is less Iron Man, more Stark (kinda like TDKR), but unlike Rises I do feel that there was a sort of smooth story-telling going on. However, it also feels like there was less exposition on how stuff works in-universe (it sounds anal until you walk out and ask yourself 'How did X did that?'), and it feels like the pacing was meant to distract us from that.",

Downside though, there's too many one liners by Tony, the story is completely predictable, Tony's anxiety attack makes him look stupid instead of sympathetic, and that twist in the middle, although it doesn't really bother me, it bothers a lot of people. Still can't judge the whole movie based on that one scene only. Overall, pretty enjoyable. Confuses the hell out of me though since there's definitely Avengers here but they're not in the movie or helping anyone even though in the movie the crisis is pretty serious, although there's Bruce Banner but that's at the end of the movie after the credits.",

I mean, just watching the trailers, it's definitely a new Iron Man we've never noticed before but want to see. Before going to see this, I read some of the user reviews. I was really surprised to hear some bad reviews from this movie. I honestly thought that those people who said the movie was bad we're just completely stupid. Yet after watching this, I realize now that they are only 75% crazy. As far as the 25%, it's filled with some unnecessary humor that lacks with the storyline. As far as the other 75%, it's filled with great action and a great storyline. Plus, we see a whole new side of Tony (Robert Downey Jr.). It is questionable whether or not you like this new turn that this character has taken. He's not his usual narcissistic self. Yet, it somewhat manages to work with the story. Not well, but it works. Also, there's a big questionable scene near the middle of the movie. I'm not going to give any spoilers, but it will effect your opinion on the rest of the movie. You'll either be o.k. with it, or you'll just want to hate the rest of the movie. Overall, it may not be what most people expected it to be, but it's still an enjoyable Iron Man movie.",

Are you trying to ground your movies with some air of \"realism\" because let's face it....you really can't ground these stories.  But...let me start by making a point I read...so Aldrich Killian was really the Mandarin.  So the Ten Rings that was mentioned in both previous movies were all his doing???  The plot hole is big enough for the Hulk to walk through.  Let me summarize the point....Tony Stark created Aldrich Killian  Mandarin by dissing him at a party and in turn, Aldrich Killian  Mandarin creates Iron Man in the first movie by capturing Stark.  Really doesn't make sense to me either.  So, that being said, let us look at the action.  Some of the action sequences were fun and the humor was nice.  But, the point to an Iron Man movie is for Iron Man to be fighting right???  Since when did Tony Stark get all bad ass and could fight that well without the suit.  It was a nice attempt but really did not work on the level that it needed to.  Now, the finale...Tony Stark had the shrapnel removed.

Unfortunately, I felt that the big twist in the movie was to set up a cheap laugh.  While it was a funny scene, it detracted from the rest of the story.  Iron Man 3 consistently prioritized humor at the expense of the story.  I did laugh a few times, but overall I found myself wondering \"what the hell is the point of this movie.\"  The villains felt shallow, the heroes (i.e. Iron Man and War Machine) seemed absent, and a lot of it just kinda felt like a Tony Stark pity party.  As a Marvel fan I have to give this film a 4, but honestly, if I was watching any other movie I don't see myself giving it higher than a 6.  The people that I saw the movie with weren't as generous as me.  It just missed the mark on so many levels.",

Most of the other plot points that were brought up during the course of the movie were either fairly dull and didn't live up to expectations or were kinda pointless. The Villain was a huge joke here. I wasn't an Iron Man fan before these movies but I heard plenty of them feel insulted with the way the Mandarin was treated and especially with the role that Sir Ben Kingsley ended up playing. But there were good parts too. It was nice to see all the armors he had made and the last fight scene was pretty neat. Nothing spectacular but it did it's job real well.

In many franchises, this would be a bit boring, but seeing how Iron Man's franchise has plenty of money, smart dialogue, and Robert Downey Jr. always spot-on as Tony Stark.  This film seemed to pick up more steam as it progressed, but there were too many points where I felt like the movie just didn't seem as interesting.  The parallels drawn to the Avengers movie and the effects being felt by Tony Stark is just as interesting, if not more, than even Guy Pearce playing a great villain.  Totally worth the money to see it in theaters, but I am going out on a limb to say this is the weakest of the three films for Iron Man.  It's still good, but it just seems to lack a little of the magic the first two movies brought.  Whether they continue Iron Man or not doesn't seem to matter right now as Avengers 2 is in the works, which will likely bring plenty of Iron Man/Tony Stark, so I'm okay with this being it for a while for a dedicated Iron Man film since it's not the end of Iron Man on the big screen.",

Fun, perfect word to summarize the film \"Iron Man 3\". The somber tone and tense past by trailers not passed print, the film follows the same tone of other films, providing just more drama and personal problems to Tony Stark. On the positive side the film has the great action scenes, much improved compared to predecessors, and has a villain in an armor of Iron Man, but since it is something positive, we have seen this before, and jokes and Tony company, which even forced and coming at a bad time collaborating pro film look good \"popcorn\" (sit and have fun). Negative, first, the story seems to force more situations like the scene in which it appears in the trailer (not really a spoiler, but for the most conservative that they would not watch the trailer not to spoil surprises mark it as spoiler) Spoiler: Stark calls Mandarin to fight personally handing her his address before reporters, without thinking of the consequences and that just having your house destroyed by helicopters. Besides containing poorly explored characters like character who is the former relationship Stark and the boy that helps. The story does not have much content there and inexplicable things and many, many loose ends. I think choosing Shane Black as director was a mistake, he learned to drive the action scenes but did not know how to fit the jokes in some of his movies that were in perfect time. Something very negative, not for the film but for the Marvel universe in film, is the way the film ended, leaving a large cucumber to solve Joss Whedon (director of Avengers who will direct Avengers 2). MANY SPOILERS below: Spoiler: Dude! What was this close? Not the end of the movie, but what became Iron Man simply resets the franchise, making Stark without armor and without direction, one of the biggest  was that Tony removed in a surgery any energy to their chest inexplicably, from what I understand it should have used this technology to remove extremis, from what I understand, because in no time as he relates in a simple surgery he was able to take, just stating why you did it so enigmatic, and what will be Pepper now has the extremis in your body? How this will influence the next stories. The film closes as if it were no more having movie Iron Man, but everyone knows that will be  The Avengers 2. And boy! what they did with \"Mandarin\"?! Okay it's time to know that he was just an actor stoned and see how it really is, it was hilarious, but the image of him that built trailers, the anxiousness of seeing outside the Mandarin tv screens where it appears in the film, was all printing, felt betrayed by the dozens of trailers as well as I hoped this \"villain\" would be the highlight of the film, the film was all but has space for funny dialogues, which does not always make us laugh and could not be in the film along with the story to put more of the best, the action, especially if it is equal to the end. Gone is the time that movies meant everyone had to have only excuses for wild action, but if it is to have a story that only serves as the background, this would be the best way, and that tinkering with the universe of Man Iron in the cinema was very radical.",

From the beginning it was good in the sense of setting up a movie. Setting the tone and even introducing new characters, building them and old to the point of keeping my interest. I was soaked into the movie until the twist. And yes it is the Mandarin twist. Now I've never read the comics but I have heard from many that this villain is that of magic base and is the arch nemesis to Tony Stark. I though wow that would make a very interesting plot point, Science versus Magic and judging from the beginning it seemed that this villain would have been an excellent counterpart to Tony Stark, But no, sadly it was treated as a joke and for that it hurts me for when it disrespects the source material. And I'm sure many would argue that this movie was meant for people who don't follow the comics and that this was supposed to be a realistic approach in Iron Man. For that I argue if this was the reason, than why do that to a certain iconic character that has been well established in the franchise. Why not use a different villain or make up a new villain? Why hype up and advertise years before and publicly showcasing The Mandarin? Now enough with the Mandarin let's talk about other points of the movie.  It was ok. But that's it. I didn't like how a lot of things were treated as a joke. Such as when Tony Stark was having panic attacks and well although it is suppose to be a serious matter, these attacks were shown in comic reliefs. These attacks could have made some interesting dilemmas during action scenes but it was cured and shrugged off before the climax. Not only that but the cure to it was lame in that it was something he was already doing in the first place. I didn't like the newest armor in that it was also treated as a joke. Yes, the armor was treated as a joke. It kept falling apart every time is hit something. Now for the overall plot. The plot was fine but very flimsy. It revolved around this virus? (not really a virus) called Estremis, which basically fixes and enhances everything in the body. So if you're missing a leg, you'll grow it back but also you have like super-human strength and stuff. Now I actually like this new thing, it was cool and interesting, and really the movie alone could have worked off this without having anything to do with the Mandarin. Woops sorry went back to The Mandarin. Other-wise I like the action, its still a good action flick, there are many other gripes about this movie but none that are as big as these points, and really it did not live up to the hype. The hype being a lie that is since the plot had nothing to do with what was advertise. Not the best Iron Man, better than 2, but the first is still better. I was really hoping this movie could have surpassed the first but it was an utter disappointment. Still though it's action right.......",

The comedy and banter between the characters is what makes this movie really fun. The action bits are sporadic, but the cliff side destruction of his home, an airplane scene, and the finale are all spectacles to watch. There are definitely some odd and unnecessary bits that awkwardly fly by, and this is by no means a retelling of the Extremis story line, but rather a take on it.

Also I think the trailers for this movie are the most misleading that I have ever seen for a movie. They advertise Mandarin out to be the main bad guy, or at least a bad guy at all. It turns out the only reason that \"The Mandarin\" was in the movie was to be a joke. For those of you that don't know, The Mandarin is to Iron Man what the Joker is to Batman. So why they chose to do this to Iron Man's archnemesis is beyond me. I think this is the weakest entry in the series, but regardless go see this movie!

Having the goofy \"actor\" Mandarin was a poke at the purists with Guy Pierce revealed as the \"real\" Mandarin.

Its a bit of a reboot making Guy Pierce the new version of the Mandarin. The movie is a solid 7 and I wouldn't mind watching it again.

To quote Stark/Rhodes on The Mandarin, as a way to paraphrase the movie  \"It's embarrassing.\"  The Mandarin has been effectively turned into a joke.  The big \"reveal\" with \"The Mandarin\" has to be my least favorite Marvel film moment ever.  The Mandarin is supposed to be to Iron Man what The Joker is to Batman, what Lex Luthor is to Superman. He's THE arch-villain... What happened, Marvel?  You just had to go and make Iron Man 3 into a big budget spy spoof buddy film with as much slapstick and sophomoric humor you could squeeze in.

Just an example of the numerous holes here is one: When Tony Stark was fighting the main Villain at the end who is powerful because he injects some fluid into his body that was made to regenerate and just so happens to also give you super strength and 3000 degrees body temp.and the ability to blow up, Tony goes through about 3 sets of armor and then fights hand to hand.  Ok no biggie. But almost dies. Only to find out that he had about 60 more suits of armor he could of wore that he decides to blowup for no real reason.  Also, apparently Stark Towers no longer exists in this world or other superheros.  because no one else could rescue the president or save air-force 1.

The treatment of the characters was not only non-entertaining, but fell very flat. Jon Farveau handled the terrorist angle brilliantly in the first film with Obadiah Stane, here The Mandarin character while decently acted by Ben Kingsley, might have worked as a \u2018bait and switch\u2019 if he had been replaced with a more interesting and menacing character other than what turned out to be the failed scientist Aldrich Killian. The plot is thin and muddled with Tony Stark suffering from anxiety attacks (he only NOW gets to that point?) again, this might work, if the movie actually showed him caring about the supposed love of this life Pepper. Instead,  it  trots along, not giving any real human connection between any of the characters. I end up going where I never thought I would with Tony Stark  not really caring what happens to him. Which makes me sad the more I think about it. Even the coined humor of the armored avenger seemed forced and often times mean and ill-spirited. If The Avengers taught us anything, it was that you can take a plot about unbelievable things and make a well thought out, believable movie out of it. Iron Man 3 suffers not just from choosing to go a less entertaining, less thought provoking route, but also because it took a step back with tired, worn, overdone concepts. Such a shame really with the wealth of material the comic world has to offer in the way of Iron Man, material Iron Man 1 & 2 took full advantage of.",

The true test of time is when these films materialize on FX cable years later, I can never get tired of watching IM1, but this last installment was blah, overdone, and hokey, Kingsley role as the villain was left to being a laughable Buffon of a joke. When will Hollywood treat the legacy of these series with more respect, sure IM3 is going to make a ton of money, it's was budgeted in at about 200 mil, but who really cares, when they slapped together, a half baked, shoddy finale to a very interesting super hero.....",

He keeps driving his armor remotely and after an amazing hero moment wrecks it once more (for like the 8th time.. which got real old) The whole movie was just an ongoing comedy. It was funny, but because I was let down by the twist the comedy lost it's effect on me and I just sat there stewing. The one liners got old and the snarkiness got irritating. The movie felt rushed too with no rise and falls of drama to build anticipation and the ending just felt like \"and then this happened and then this happened and everything's ok now, ok bye\" I wanted the real Mandarin and I want the chaos I foresaw in my mind this entire last year. And I didn't want Pepper Pots being a mutant and then suddenly not. I felt like Tony didn't use his suits to their full potential.

Firstly.....Robert Downey Jr is a number 1 badass as Iron Man!!! I like how he acts and how he is when it comes to being witty. He is almost the merc with the mouth (DEADPOOL MOVIE NOW PLEASE!!!!!). I also liked the action scenes which were packed full of explosions and smart gestures that made up a pleasant scene. However, there were a few negatives about this film that I have to mention. The second half of the film was just meh to me....I mean sure there was 'action' but it was all a bit slow moving and just made me shrug my shoulders. The ending frustrated me the most.....it to me just felt like he just gave up in the end and quit abruptly as being Iron Man. So to sum it up, Iron Man 3 is a pretty good film was some highs and lows.",

Really dumb. The storyline was just OK. Couple laughs here and there, but all-in-all it was a waste of time and money. I guess I'm glad they are done with the I.M. movies.

I ended up seeing it during memorial day weekend, and it was a full house. I just finished it and I have a bit to say. First of all, horrible way of hiding the villain, the minute you see him you can tell he's the villain, they did the same thing in Batman forever. The bad guys Tony has to fight are unclear, in how to kill. They get shot in the head and even get caught in explosions, but they still don't die. Only when they get hit through the chest do they finally die, also the effect they use for them doesn't look that great. The fact that nobody could figure out how the Manderin Attacks occur; even though we see how in the first 15-20 minutes, until a little too late in the film is a bit infuriating. The fact that Tony can now remotely control the suits almost makes him unimportant because now he doesn't have to put himself in danger anymore. Finally the most biggest complaint I have is the fact that Robert Downey Jr doesn't do his normal likeable performances, but feels more like he's on auto-pilot. This is pretty important to like the main character, especially when it's talking about his life story. I guess I should say some positive things about this flick. I like some of the effects like always, but doesn't have that same charm that the first one does. Some of the action scenes are pretty good, the airplane scene in particular is well done. The ending fight with the suits vs the Extremis soldiers is okay, but is bit messy to. At last I think Ben Kingsly performance as an actor is funny; him being a terrorist not so much, I'm glad that they didn't try too make him so serious and decided not make anything possibly offensive. In the end this film is really different from what I expected, what I got wasn't all too bad, but I wanted something else.",

I haven't read many comic books and out of the ones I have, none of them have ever been an Iron Man comic, but at the end of the day it feels like that if there were a film that was able to get as close to the spirit of its source material (or even the artistic medium originally used for that matter) that it might be this one. Granted, I have nothing to base that on, but it is simply a gut instinct in that the tone of this film is very light in its banter, very quick in its wit, and also more personal at the same time than I ever expected it to be, especially considering the obvious point that it's a massive summer blockbuster. While Iron Man 3 doesn't exactly live up to the expectations I was holding for it, it instead reroutes them and delivers a story that was more on the opposite side of the standard super hero flick spectrum while still containing enough explosions and fight scenes to appease those that go to these kinds of movies expecting nothing more than that. Director Shane Black (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang) takes over for Jon Favreau (who still shows up to play Happy Hogan) and took on writing duties as well and has delivered a very Shane Black-esque script with plenty of self-referential dialogue and a large scale action set piece every twenty minutes or so. I enjoyed the film immensely and found Robert Downey Jr. as good as ever as Tony Stark, but despite all the flash and bang it still felt like there was something missing, or maybe that's just because Captain America, Thor, and The Hulk didn't bother to show up.",

To summarize the overall plot of the new Iron Man, it is basically about the champ down on his luck who needs a comeback. Tony Stark's new nemesis is a mysterious terrorist known as the Mandarin, played in an out-of-character role by Ben Kingsley.

There are some big set-pieces that holds true to the capabilities of Marvel universe in putting you in awe but the remainders of the movie leans much more closer to a spy-thriller than the usual superhero cliches.

The story here is more personal than any of the other film in the series as it focuses more on Tony Stark than his suit of armor. We get a sense of depth to the character and the psychological problems he has since putting on the suit. Iron Man becomes more like a cocoon rather than something that actually enhances the man.

The destruction has always been a big part of Iron Man and in Iron Man 3 they still bring that back, I just felt the movie was so cheesy and there were really no characters to care about other than Tony Stark himself. Like I said before there are some good parts of the movie that I enjoyed, Tony Stark's humor is back and is still solid, the jokes were usually hit or miss but when they hit they were good. I recommend Iron Man 1 over and of the 2, as the second was mostly corny as well. I give this movie 6 only because of the humor, SFX, destruction and the opening 10-15 minutes were great. Otherwise I would stay away from this movie, and if you haven't seen the first one watch that! All the \"reviewers\" on this movie giving it a one have either a) based there opinion on just the one movie, not the trilogy b) based there review on how it did not follow the comic books which isn't a big deal c) have only wrote one review (spam).

To me, the twist turned the movie into a light-hearted action-comedy, and I was kind of hoping Iron Man would go out with a bang, with a darker plot (I'm assuming this was his last solo movie). But it wasn't enough to make me upset after seeing it. If I liked Iron Man more, I probably would have been really disappointed by this movie.",

      "text": "When I first heard the announcement of Iron Man 3 I though \"to top off a movie with 7 superheroes they're making a movie with only 1 or 2 heroes, what happened to the ideology of crossovers?\" Watching the trailers and this movie had rid me of this stupidity for the most part. Compared to the first two, Iron Man 3 takes a darker yet more suspense filled approach. Tony Stark is no longer the charming hero as he was in the Avengers, but a man trapped in dreaded post-recurring nightmares and anxiety attacks that had haunted him from the Avengers initiative. This does dramatically improve the importance of characters such as Rody and Pepper, but looking back at the previous two Iron Man movies it feels like the dark and to some extent humourless Timothy Dalton phase of the James Bond series which began right after the comedy styled and light hearted Roger Moore phase which makes you question whether this is really a reboot of the series. The Mandarin has charm and class, yet hides a cruel and un-redeeming character and similar to previous Iron Man villains he a recognizable character who can be easily feared and identified. Though the plot seems basic and hold it's moments, I'm rather disappointed with minor plot holes that could have been avoid through simple logic and instinct. If Tony Stark is threatening a terrorist group while providing the address of his home, shouldn't Stark at least get Pepper somewhere safe and possibly call Shield to provide support or maybe ask Bruce Banner or Steve Rogers to help? Hell, why isn't Stark wearing his Iron Man suit when he knows that he'll be attacked by a group of terrorists. Overall it's a great entry of the Iron Man series though with some flaws. I find the Mandarin's motive to be a little farfetched and the post-credit scene was not worth the wait.",

But after looking through the plot and recalling certain scenes, I realized that this movie was a solid film, not amazing, not horrible, but solid. My one major complaint about it was that Director Shane Black tried to make it too funny. its an action movie with comedy, not an action comedy movie. half of the good comedy was some of Starks clever remarks towards the young boy and Mandarin, and the other half was the great satire dealing with how America views terrorism. The action sequences were great! Especially his house being destroyed. I enjoyed the major plot twist of this movie. It was certainly something no one expected to happen, and whether you were excited or pissed about it, you were indeed shocked by it. Despite Robert Downey's great performance as Iron Man again, I must say that Guy Pearce delivered the best performance in this movie. He was sinister, seductive, hate able yet believable. I truly think this summer will be the summer of great super villains. With actors like Pearce, Michael Shannon, and Benedict Cumberbatch playing villains who can easily steal the praise of the movie from the hero themselves. Overall I liked this movie, everyone should see it at least once, Ill see it again just not in theaters. I appreciate how it brought closure to Iron Man, but I wonder how he will be used in the next Avengers movies. Plus he will probably have more of those weird anxiety attacks. And Mandarin's army reminded me too much of the robot villain from Terminator 2, I guess they were supposed to be that way.",

The person (not saying who) who killed the actual villain made me laugh, seriously Tony Stark and his somewhat 43 suits couldn't defeat the villain!?? Wow..

The man in the iron suit is back for the third installment of this franchise, but is his return a victorious one or was it  disappointing? For me, it wasn't victorious as I thought it would be, because this movie has a lot of problems. The poor use of the Extremis storyline was downfall for this film, their was no need for this storyline, they couldv'e just focused on the conflict between on Iron Man and Mandarin. Mandarin is my favorite villain from the Iron man comics and I was really excited on how were they going to present him, in this movie they had a twist about the mandarin's true identity, that twist was my biggest gripe for this movie, they revealed that mandarin was just an actor and guy pierce's character was the real one. I thought that they were just joking, I did not expect them to go on that direction, they shouldv'e just avoided that twist and just stayed true to the comics. The acting in this movie was fantastic, all of them did a good job, especially Robert Downey Jr. and the effexts looked great. This movie was not epic and dramatic as I thought it would be, because if you watched the trailers, then you know what I am talking about. Iron Man 3 was still a fun and good movie, the movie was nice start for Marvel's phase 2 and I am excited for their other movies, also hope that this will not be the last time that we'll see about Iron Man 3.

The mixture between seriousness and comedy isn't well blended. In fact, the way a scene can try to inspire a sense of gravitas, and then cut quickly to a joke is quite jarring.

It's well-acted (once again, especially by Downey, Jr.), it's visually brilliant, pretty well-written, exciting, action-packed and all-around fun. It's not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, and hardcore comic fans might not be as happy with this one as they were with the previous \"Iron Man\" films, but all things considered, I found \"Iron Man 3\" to be a thoroughly entertaining film that is absolutely worth watching.",

The rest of you, you're in for a damn good film! Something that the Iron Man films do brilliantly is great acting and casting. Well I'm happy to report that this film does both with excellence and flair. Surprisingly no one actor feels better than the other, creating a strong realism, especially in dramatic scenes. Like most Marvel movies the action is amazing and varied. One scene you'll see Tony without his suit, fighting super powered beings using only his intellect, and the next you'll see a pulse pounding air born rescue. However, the biggest thing I like about the action is how much there is. There's not to little ( like in Superman Returns ) and there's not to much ( like in Revenge of the Sith ). This leaves room for a fantastic story... That is until it hits the half way mark. The film brings in a twist, that it thinks is so clever, but just end up being stupid, and a slap in the face to all comic fans! This poor choice gets rid of an awesome, dark villain, The Mandarin, and replaces him with a poorly written villain that's generic as hell! Then when the story gets back on track, it introduces an awful ending that feels so rushed. In addition to this, this film has so many mistakes it's almost laughable! And its a shame because Shane Black's directing talent really shows. The camera feels organic and never out of place. If the fanboy inside of me was reviewing this, I would give it a 0. But because it's such a good film in its own right, I can't do that.",

      "text": "Iron Man is the grand return of Tony Stark in the suit with a story that tests his limits. It has its moments but it also has some major problems that hold it back. The film has Stark suffer some panic attacks after his near death experience in the events of The Avengers. The panic attacks had some potential to give him more depth considering the fact that he was surrounded by superhuman and even gods but it is really not that fleshed out enough. There is also a controversial conspiracy involving former U.S war veterans who regain their limbs based on an experiment that went wrong. This presents an interesting dilemma for Stark to come fully face to face with the horrors of his previous arms race campaign. How the war veterans were portrayed though are pretty questionable to say the least. Ben Kinsley is one of the best highlights of the film both for his propaganda videos as the ultimate reveal of him being a mere puppet for the real villain. It is understandable why fans will be very dissapointed but the Mandarin would not have flown well   in today's PC culture since the Mandarin from the original comic is really nothing more than a racial stereotype of the Chinese. Although the plot twist was hilarious the true villain was a bland antagonist to Stark. Speaking of which, Robert Downey Jr is once again the best thing about this film especially with the interaction between him and the child actor. The child actor did an outstanding job developing a relationship with Stark. This is also a film where Stark has to rely on his wits for the majority of the film outside of the one time he gave his address to the Mandarin (the single most stupid thing any Superhero has ever done). The action is also pretty strong with impressive set pieces which actually kept me at the edge of my seat. The climax is outstanding with all of the multiple suits and Stark changing in between the suits in mid flight which displays some impressive visuals. His relationship with Pepper has developed alot more as well and I found myself genially concerned about their relationship status. If you are wiling to accept some of the flaws or the controversial plot twist than this film will definitely keep you entertained for a long time.",

Plot holes everywhere, Tony Stark is no longer Tony Stark, bad character development, I just don't know how the MCU could go from the Avengers to this nonsense. Marvel is only in it for the money, the MCU has made great films (The Avengers, Iron Man, The Winter Soldier, Civil War) but movies like this one make me suffer from a case of franchise fatigue.",

Still these \"critics\" don't outright pan this piece of **** movies Kevin Feige vomits out?! What have we become as a specie of supposedly intelligence when this piece of **** grosses a billion dollars worldwide, I guess one line comedy, a charismatic actor and appeal to the lowest common denominator equals box office gold.

Seeing 'Pepper Potts' in the Iron Man suit is about as thrilling as it sounds. Awful, awful film.",

The film is a little darker and more serious than its predecessors but not by much. Entertaining adventure, some cool action sequences, with some surprises, let\u2019s get right to the surprises. 1 of the notable twist was Ben Kingsley\u2019s supposedly role of The Mandarin, wasn\u2019t really The Mandarin, he was just an actor with substance-abuse hired by the real villain to fake it. As a long time, comic book fan, I\u2019ve gotta say, that was truly a disappointing twist in the movie, disgusted by it. And that\u2019s that.",
