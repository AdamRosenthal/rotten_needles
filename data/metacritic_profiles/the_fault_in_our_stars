At the end of 2015 I prepared myself to just enjoy the movie and shut out the pain, suffering, etc.  Best movie I had seen in over a year!  I have seen it since that first viewing and I never grow tired of it.  It isn't depressing, it is life affirming.  The writers did a fantastic job getting in so much good, valuable material but never taking their focus off the main point.  It is so much more that a love story, a heartbreaking story, a life affirming story it is just glorious.  I am constantly surprised at my normal reactions to movies I see, I don't normally seem to get out of most movies what other people take away from them, but in this case I hope people watch the movie and pay attention to every part of it.  This isn't a movie you want to get side tracked while watching.  I think the last movie I rated a 10 was \"Sound of Music\", although maybe a couple others through the years.  The idea that this was a \"sappy\" movie or any other such adjective just means that either the person wasn't \"open\" to the movie, didn't feel the depth of emotions of all kinds, didn't pay attention or possibly just hasn't lived enough life to begin to see what the movie offered.  I don't remember crying at all, I was a little too busy staying focused on everything else going on in the movie.  The movie \"Dying Young\" with all it's great acting, story and everything else just doesn't come close to this movie.",

This movie does not deserve a perfect 10 (it's no 12 Years a Slave or Pulp Fiction), but it does deserve some credibility where it earned it\u2014 the cinematography and the acting,  most notably. Both leads did a wonderful job selling their characters. Unfortunately, however (and this may just be a critique of the book rather than the movie), the plot was somewhat flawed. For one, the movie (unlike the book) didn't explain why the father wasn't more of a prominent figure, whereas the mother was heavily involved. That's a simple flaw, and not one worth giving a lower score for. What does alter my score, however, are the multiple plot cliches found throughout the movie, as well as film cliches. There was, of course!, the typical 'grab something at the same time and touch our hands \"accidentally\" ' cliche. What I do commemorate is the slight plot twist: (DON'T READ THIS SENTENCE IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE OR READ THE BOOK) most people would probably assume that Hazel would die, rather than Gus. So that was a nice gut-buster. Overall, apart from the cliches and ultimate goal of causing the audience to flood the theater in their own tears, the movie was entertaining and inspiring (as well as the book, obviously). It reminds me of Perks of Being a Wallflower, but not quite as good. It was an interesting take on a 21st century coming-of-age film (which is how I understood it to be, but with a touch of cancer). As a film, this movie deserves between a 5.5-6.5; as modern entertainment, this movie deserves an 8-9. Recommended but not praised.",

Never maudlin, and delicately handled drama, \"Fault\" makes you appreciate life, love, and the simple moments that make up our life. Shailene Woodley is amazing in this film. She inhabits this character so fully that it is hard to not emotionally invest in her from the get go. She isn't afraid to expose her emotions and let the story unfold. Ansel Elgort is also a brilliant star shining in the \"Fault\" universe. He understands this beloved character and creates a nuanced, later raw performance that is not only impressive, but awe inspiring. A brave actor and truly talented man. The scene on the bench in Amsterdam between the two actors should be studied in master classes for actors. The rest of the cast also meld into their respective characters wonderfully and round out this phenomenal story. A gifted soundtrack that not only adds to the film, it draws the audience in. This kind of film is important to make. It truly affirms that love isn't perfect and neither is life, you do not get a say in your circumstances, but you can control your reaction and the effect they have on it. Life is messy and emotional and \"Fault\" never takes advantage of the audience. This isn't a tearjerker, this is an emotion evoker. Boone brings this beloved story to life and with our hearts and minds.",

Grazie a una sceneggiatura che schiaccia a lungo il pedale del freno sul lato della commozione prima di perdersi nei sentimentalismi conclusivi e a dei personaggi che trasmettono empatia anche grazie a quella che appare essere una sentita partecipazione da parte di tutto il cast, il film si mantiene su di un livello pi\u00f9 che dignitoso e riesce a non far troppo pesare il suo essere un dispensatore di ansie lungo due ore. E questo anche se a ben vedere le caratteristiche immancabili del genere (dei generi) ci sono tutte. Per il filone adolescenziale, ecco la coppia centrale tanto carina e sfortunata, l'eroismo per amore (Gus santo subito), l\u2019amico spalla comica, i sogni della giovinezza che si infrangono sulla realt\u00e0 per non parlare della colonna sonora che \u00e8 una compilation di ballate venate di opportuna malinconia per accompagnare ogni momento saliente (un po\u2019 invadente, ma nel complesso non male con la presenza di gente come Jake Bugg, Tom Odell, Sun Kil Moon oltre al buon Vivaldi che fa figo e non impegna). In riferimento all'ambiente ospedaliero, non mancano i ricoveri d'urgenza, i cigli inumiditi dalle lacrime e un paio di scene madri: insomma, va dato merito a Scott Neustadter e Michael Weber di essersi mantenuti in miracoloso equilibrio su molti aspetti insidiosi e al semiesordiente Josh Boone di aver diretto il tutto seguendo la stessa idea di fondo. Altrove stanno invece i problemi, il principale dei quali non \u00e8 la presenza di qualche colossale stupidaggine \u2013 l'applauso nella casa di Anna Frank? Ecco perch\u00e8 i curatori del museo hanno impedito le riprese in loco della scena\u2026 - bens\u00ec che la pellicola duri mezzora di troppo. Il motivo va cercato in un eccesso di didascalismo in moltissime parti, come se il fatto di non raccontare tutto potesse deludere gli spettatori, specie quelli che hanno amato il libro; una scelta in contrasto con la limitazione del contrappunto creato dalle situazioni di lieve commedia presenti invece sulla pagina scritta (o almeno cos\u00ec mi dice mia figlia adolescente). Il risultato sono una serie di rallentamenti \u2013 lo sviluppo della relazione contrassegnato da un sovrappi\u00f9 di chiacchiera a sproposito, l'interminabile racconto dei tre giorni ad Amsterdam, un finale al quale avrebbe fatto bene qualche ellissi in pi\u00f9 \u2013 che raffreddano un po\u2019 il coinvolgimento nella vicenda della giovane Hazel, diciassettenne malata senza molte speranze e perci\u00f2 incupita (malgrado gli affettuosissimi genitori) che vede brillare un raggio di sole grazie all'amore, ricambiato, dell'altrettanto sfortunato coetaneo Gus, capace per lei di andare oltre il dolore. Come gi\u00e0 accennato sopra, contribuisce invece a catturare lo spettatore una prova degli attori nel complesso molto buona, sia per quanto riguarda la coppia di ragazzi che, costituita da Shailene Woodley (forse un po\u2019 grandicella per dimostrare diciassette anni, ma davvero brava a dare spessore ai moltissimi primi piani) e Ansel Elgort, interagisce con estrema naturalezza, sia per gli adulti, fra i quali si segnalano Laura Dern che riesce a stare dentro le righe come madre di Hazel e, soprattutto, Willem Dafoe capace di regalare una sgradevolezza che significa pi\u00f9 di mille parole al misantropo Van Houten. Il risultato complessivo \u00e8, in fondo l'ennesima variazione su di un ulteriore clich\u00e9, quello che vede delle persone normali alle prese con una situazione tutto meno che ordinaria, ma \u2013 sempre se non spaventa l'argomento e tenendo comunque conto che titoli come \u2018Noi siamo infinito\u2019 militano in un'altra serie \u2013 i pregi finiscono per aver la meglio sui difetti e far la conoscenza con Hazel e Gus pu\u00f2 valer la pena anche da parte di chi non fa parte della categoria di spettatori di riferimento.",

It's not a weepy in the classic sense because I never felt that they were trying to make me cry. The direction and the two main performances really shy away from simply treacly excess. The film is way too long by about 25 minutes but the director and two stars deserve huge kudos for keeping it real. Shailne Woodley is adorable, wonderful and honest. Equally, Ansel Elgort is a really interesting choice for the male lead. He's not pretty by today's standards and a bit of an awkward lug. Not at all what you expect from an actor in this role.

Shailene Woodley continues to convince me in this one that she is the next huge film actress, while this one also served as a great way for Ansel Elgort to introduce himself to me, because his acting is also incredible here. Though about kids with cancer, the tearjerking moments never feel as though they are relying solely on that, because there is just so much more to this film. Truly just beautiful in every way imaginable, The Fault in Our Stars shattered my expectations. The script, written by two of my favorite writers Scott Neustadter and Michael H. Weber, is great. I cannot compare it to the book, but all the same, the script is perfect. It is amazing how this film can truly make you feel something for every character, as it really does not have any one dimensional characters. They are all multi-faceted in their own way and that is really what helps this one hit me in the way it has. I would also be remiss if I did not mention how good Nat Wolff, Laura Dern, and Willem Dafoe were in their supporting roles. Truly impressive stuff all-around. I love surprises like this.",

      "text": "\"The Fault in Our Stars\" resulted in deep thoughts my mind was able to create, rather than to feel numb about it. It tried so hard to make us have sympathy towards the characters, and it worked beautifully. The plot is developed to be cliched, but the director was able to create every scene like it was original, which was astonishing. It had me in tears and it's a film I definitely will never forget.",
