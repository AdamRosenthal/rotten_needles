Cinematically, the plot was cliched and offensive and the production aspects were boring, but the film had an excuse. This film was technically directed by David O. Russell (Silver Linings Playbook and American Hustle) in 2008, but he dropped his involvement in the film and much of it was reshot without him. This film made me laugh in many parts, however, and that is what this film is meant to be, a comedy. So do not watch this if you are looking for high-quality work like Russell's other films, but this is a lot of fun to watch.",
