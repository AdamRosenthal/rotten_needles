The worst parts of Burlesque:  the no-real-conflict storyline, the criminal under-use of Alan Cumming, and the missed opportunity at having Kristen Bell's character have a real rivalry with Christina Aguilera's (or any development, for that matter).  Bell and Cumming are both tremendous musical actors, and it seems such a waste to have them in a musical where they don't get to strut their stuff.  But, when it's good, it's a pleasure.

      "text": "As a reward for straight guys who were broad-minded enough to withstand same-sex kissing and buggery among cowboys, Anne Hathaway took off her top, in what was, and still is, the gayest movie ever, hands down. Terrified of glimpsing full frontal male nudity, Hathaway's 36C breasts put the heterosexual male at ease, remasculating them for the remainder of Ang Lee's \"Brokeback Mountain\", especially the stretch run when Jack Twist(Jake Gylenhaal) tells Enis(Heath Ledger), \"I wish I knew how to quit you.\" The same broad-minded straight guys expecting the same sort of compensation for patronizing \"Burlesque\"(a musical that features not just one, but two gay icons), will be sorely disappointed. Kristen Bell, never nude, flashes some skin, but her showgirl character, a high-maintenance diva, is not that kind of showgirl, because burlesque(not to be confused with exotic dancing) is striptease with art pretensions, in which dancers tantalize the audience with mystery, so Nikki wears pasties, and Christine Aguilera's breasts are strategically covered with stage props. To add insult to injury, the only nipples we see are a dude's nipples, Cam Gigadet's nipples, and the only bared ass, Cam Gigadet's ass. Aguilera's well-documented nipple rings are left to the imagination. Playing a designer hayseed from Iowa named Ally, the clothing optional girl who likes to get \"Dirty\", as she's done throughout the course of her career, shows off her skin and pipes in equal measures, a balancing act that sells the triple threat(singer, dancer...actress?) short, when Aguilera's sex kitten image can often overshadow her aptitude for peerless vocalization,Knowing in her heart that the club patrons will value live singing more than t*ts and a*s, Ally convinces Tess(Cher, in yet another comeback) to ditch the practice of having her girls lip synch over canned music during their routines. In doing so, the contract between the filmmaker and moviegoer is breached. Normally, the audience is complicitous to the habitude of musicals, in which actors mouth the words to the accompanying song that plays over the soundtrack, but \"Burlesque\" loses its artistic license, the leeway to misrepresent reality, the very moment Ally broaches Tess over the subject of pre-recorded music. In Peter Bogdanovich's \"At Long Last Love\", actors intoned lyrics under a live boom mic while the cameras rolled, as an experiment in adding realism to the musical genre. It didn't work, but that's because the filmmaker had non-singers like Cybil Shepard, Burt Reynolds, and John Hillerman at his disposal, all of whom possessed voices which needed a liberal dose of sweetening in post-production, and then some. (Ulu Grosbard's \"Georgia\" used the same methodology to better effect.) \"Burlesque\", on the other hand, has Aguilera, who possesses a voice big enough to pull off the live thing, and yet, in the crucial moment when Ally reveals her secret weapon(it's not a vagina, that's Elizabeth Berkley's secret weapon) to the burlesque world after Nikki cuts off the music in the middle of a performance, the voice we hear is clothed, not naked as it should be. Ally's disdain for fakery makes us hyper-aware of the fact that she's doing the same thing, albeit with her own voice. After all, once it becomes obvious that \"Burlesque\" isn't going to be a softcore porn flick like Paul Verhoeven's \"Showgirls\", as a consolation prize, people will want to hear Aguilera sing, for real. Straight or gay, people aren't coming to see her act, that's for sure.",

Before heading to watch thiz movie, I already had my own imagination about what the story would look like, I thought maybe it revolved around a countryside girl who was about to try her luck to chase her dream in a big city (eventually the city is Los Angeles and the girl is Ali, played by Christina Aguilera), maybe she would start from a cloistered but extraordinary nite club (apparently it is named: Burlesque), maybe she would have a tough beginning for her career and there would be such a mentor for her (I talk about Cher), maybe she was going to meet her love interest, a pretty boy with an attitude (I talk about Cam Gigandet), or maybe she would be forced to quarrel with her envious evil colleague as well (I talk about Kristen Bell). And for the ending I do not have to explain, I give it to you to figure it out yourself, I am pretty sure that you have already know the ending as well, and you are right! In the tradition of COYOTE UGLY (2000) and Rob Marshall movies, such as CHICGO (2002) and NINE (2009), here it comes a new breed of the genre. The movie is second Directing effort (after GLASS HOUSE: THE GOOD MOTHER (2006)) by Child Star Actor from THE GOONIES (1985), Steve Antin. Thiz Ali character is obviously made for Aguilera, it is like let a fish swimming freely into the sea. It flows naturally. Cher is an Iconic Legend who makes a one dimensional impression, there is no specific chemistry with other Casts, she seems to be talking to herself. Cam Gigandet, after seeing his macho performance in NEVER BACK DOWN (2008), thiz time he plays more easy-going and fun role. But the worst of the worst is Kristen Bell who delivers a horrible nightmare performance, it is not convincing at all as Ali competitor. Better performances come from Stanley Tucci, Eric Dane and Allan Cumming. Forget about the Casts, the film once again is an Aguilera playground. Her powerful voice covers up all of the flaws. The opening song SOMETHING GOT A HOLD ON ME is my favorite with gratifying 70s Rock n Roll Tune. With all those fabulous songs, it occurred to me, why there is not any duet song from these two World-Class Performers. Anyway, the dancing and cabaret performances are splendid. Aguilera performance is very hypnotic and spectacular. But it came to my mind, who does not want to pay small nite club cheap ticket in which there is Aguilera performance. Hello?? It is Christina Aguilera on the stage! The story is predictable and the conflict is clich\u00c3\u00a9. It doesn\u00e2",
