The viewer is enticed by a richly dark vision of the streets of London circa  late 1800's, when the townsfolk were undereducated, vulgar, and easily seduced by myths, superstitions, and local legends. There are well-defined class strata characterized by the aristocracy, who eat the finest cheese in the town of Cheesebridge and who wear white hats, and the working class shmegegges, who speak a thick brogue, are quick to initiate witch hunts, and wear the inferior red hats. At the center of their low-class hysteria is the knowledge that the town is infested with little monsterlike trolls who live in the sewers and who are said to snatch children and valuables; the trolls are purported to have once eaten an abducted baby. The little monsters  have no clothes, and they hide their nakedness by wearing boxes around the midriff, taking their Christian names from whatever product appears on the box labels\u2014hence, Fish, Oilcan, Wheels, and Shoe, among others. The boxes have a dual function because at any time they can hunker down and snap the lid closed in order to hide in plain sight, which they do whenever they feel threatened or scared. They speak a funny alien language understood by only one human, Eggs (Isaac Hampstead Wright), the baby they abducted but did not eat; in fact, they lovingly raised the child as their own, having abducted him only to rescue him from a malevolent force.",

O est\u00fadio Laika mais uma vez abusa da ideia de mostrar uma hist\u00f3ria com um plot simples, clich\u00ea, com uma li\u00e7\u00e3o de moral no final, para com tudo isso agradar as crian\u00e7as...
