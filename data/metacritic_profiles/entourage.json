      "text": "Entourage the movie is a bit of a celebration for the 8 amazing seasons that ran on HBO.  It won't stand as strong on its own given that audiences will have roughly 10-15 minutes to get to know these characters that we fans of the TV show had years to invest into.  Translation: it's better to see the series before you see the show.  There are numerous inside jokes and tons of celebs that are in this movie for a reason.  Like high school reunion, it's crazy and awesome to see all of these people throwing down in one viewing.  What is most unfortunate is that Entourage ran on incredible scripting and strong characters  that worked through intense Hollywood-life problems that spanned numerous episodes.  Throwing what usually took 4-8 episodes to discover and resolve is meant to be shoved into a movie that's well under 2 hours.  Jeremy Piven as Ari Gold remains one of my favorite characters EVER, and even he gets gated at times.  Piven's ability to rage all over the screen is one of the cornerstones of the show and only gets partially displayed in this movie.  There are a few side stories that begin in this movie that never really pan out either, making me wonder why its makers didn't spend a little more time hashing out the details.  Either way, I enjoyed the movie and finally watched it after going through the TV series for a second time.  It moderately taps into the events of the series finale and I enjoyed that about it.  But anyone coming in off the street is going to be at a disadvantage from minute one, so hopefully you can dig the humor and the fun being had on-screen enough to not care too much about how this crew wound up where they are.",

But I DID like the TV Show, but ended up enjoying a half baked, but still watchable movie. The fan base is huge, and by their standards Entourage is already a hit, but there are flaws that are clearly visible in this hype-a-thon, that make it watchable. Okay, there are a LOT of cameos, Liam Neeson shows up, Ronda Rousey, Mark Wahlberg and many more stars, but the highlight of this movie is Jeremy Piven's Ari. Man, does Piven's totally KILL it, his comedy is sub par, and is filled with classic references to the TV Show. Turtle, Drama and Vince are the usual show of guys, and didn't age or change much. Not that I have noticed. But even in this mediocre film, there is a lot of fun to be had. I will watch it again for Piven and the comedy, but it will erase from my mind after a while. Watch it, if you loved the TV Show. Otherwise, find something else this week.",

Sure it could have been better. The story was dumb, really just excuse to get the boys back together. 8 out of 10 as a fan for me. Loved seeing them all having fun and ARI back to his antics. Its never been about the story in a sense, its the world Doug Ellin created and Mark Walberg lived that most fans like to vacation to from their normal real lives. Vinnie Chase and the Chasers!",

It seemed to just be going through the motions the last couple years, but I still found it easy enough to watch. But this movie takes that indifference to a whole new level. I was perfectly ready to enjoy it with no great expectations, but I was blown away by how little effort they put into the script. Not only was the storyline dull and ridiculous, but it was like they had written it years earlier and couldn't be bothered to make the relevant changes based on things that happened in the series. They just kind of erased everything from the final season and started from scratch, including repeating the same tired old E and Sloane dilemma nearly word for word yet again. All in all, shocking bad, especially considering the actors were fine (with the major exception of Rhonda Rousey), as they obviously all know their characters inside and out.",

      "text": "\u201cEntourage\u201d written and directed by Doug Ellin is a continuation of the popular HBO show of the same name that came to an end in 2011. It is a wholly unnecessary film that in its opening minutes completely undoes much of what the show closed on in its final episodes. Truth be told it is best seen in its original format, television. This is because the movie felt like nothing more than a glorified episode of the show just with more cameos. And I mean a lot of cameos. After a while you start thinking of the people who do not show up instead of the ones that do and some of the cameos are brutally short and pointless except to say, \u201coh hey look who it is,\u201d before they are whisked off the screen. This is not to say the movie is horrible. Being a fan of the show I found many moments in the film to be just as entertaining and humorous as they were before with Vinnie, E, Drama, Turtle, and Ari going through the motions. For those wondering, the \u2018R\u2019 rating does get you plenty of shameless T&A; from the most gorgeous women they could cattle call for the film. You also get a healthy dose of \u2018Ari-isms\u2019 from Jeremy Piven. So if you are a die-hard fan of the show go see it. If you never watched the show you won't have a clue who anyone is or why they are important. In the end I think this world would have been best served leaving the boys alone in 2011 to ride off into the sunset. Instead we get a mildly entertaining film that you will likely enjoy in nine months on HBO from your couch.",
