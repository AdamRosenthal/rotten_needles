This film won't break any new ground (although it may launch Charlie Day's big screen stardom), but it's energy will certainly keep you amused.",

      "text": "With an extremely good cast, \"Horrible Bosses\" is a surprisingly good comedy! With a reasonably interesting and silly plot, it manages to keep the audience entertained, while not being overly diluted and stupid, like many comedies nowadays are. There are never really dull moments in the film, and the action is ever-present, which provides for good entertainment. What I really enjoyed are the supporting performances, actually. I thought they were amazing - much better than the leads. That being said, Charlie Day is the cutest thing around and I could watch him for hours. But Jennifer Aniston, Kevin Spacey and Colin Farrell all do amazing jobs. Aniston is perfect as the kinky, sexy, sex-crazed maniac boss, and should definitely experiment some more with characters like these. Farrell reminds me of Tom Cruise in \"Tropic Thunder\" - same look, same crazy, same good performance. Overall, the performances are the really fun, surprising factor here, making the film truly fun and entertaining! Definitely fun to watch!",

An ensemble cast that coukdnt have been cast better with all characters taking on their roles brilliantly. But two actors that stand out against the rest of the cast is Charlie Day and Jennifer Aniston, they have excellent chemistry together, and As soon as both appear on screen together you know sparks will fly. Jennifer Aniston is outstanding in a role no one would have expected, with her dirty talk and sexual ways, she is different and excellent at it. Her role could either be a one off or the start of a brilliant new acting route for her. But above all is Charlie Day, every scene he is in is hilarious, and you would seriously believe this is what Charlies real life persona is like. Its hard to describe how execellent and hilarious he is in the film without watching it for yourself. The only bad points of this film is it is not consistently funny, nor a plot that is by the end very intruging or memorable. But overall a truly fantastic comedy film that pretty much everyone could enjoy, just dont watch with your parents or grandparents!",

I love that she goes all the way and really commits to these roles.  I know she had a brief period in her career when some other celeb broke up with her?  Who was that, Brad Pitt?  Pffft!

But the movie had a lot of focus on this character (and stand out the most from all the horrible bosses). I would of liked to see a little bit more situations involving Dr. Julia Harris, D.D.S. (Jennifer Aniston) and Bobby Pellitt (Colin Farrell). Especially Jennifer Aniston, she was hot. In fact, I would like to had her has a boss. Anyway, the filmmakers did a great job creating theses characters. Has for our heroes, they were hilarious. It was fun to watch these normal people trying to kill there bosses, and failing at it.

There's a number of memorable quotes and fun situations to keep this movie going.

What made this film stand out from other raunchy comedies, was that there wasn't just one super funny guy that the other played off of. Every character had their moment and was funny in their own way. The story was fairly original too. Three miserable guys decide all their problems would end if they kill each other's boss and they go on a hilarious mission to get the job done. While I love the idea and thought the movie was genuinely funny, what it lacks is character development. Other than the abuses they face at work, you don't really know too much about these guys and where they are coming from. I feel like that weakened the film, but what more than makes up for it is a ton of hilarious cameos. I love cameos and there are some great ones from Jennifer Aniston, Jamie Foxx, Donald Sutherland, Bob Newhart, and Collin  Farrell. Horrible Bosses while lacking substance is defiantly good for a few laughs, which is pretty much all that I expect from these types of movies.",

But two actors that stand out against the rest of the cast is Charlie Day and Jennifer Aniston, they have excellent chemistry together, and As soon as both appear on screen together you know sparks will fly. Jennifer Aniston is outstanding in a role no one would have expected, with her dirty talk and sexual ways, she is different and excellent at it. Her role could either be a one off or the start of a brilliant new acting route for her. But above all is Charlie Day, every scene he is in is hilarious, and you would seriously believe this is what Charlies real life persona is like. Its hard to describe how exeellent and hilarious he is in the film without watching it for yourself. The only bad points of this film is it is not consistently funny, nor a plot that is by the end very intruiging or memorable.

Jason Sudeikis brings nothing to the table despite his extensive comedy work on Saturday Night Live, Jason Bateman just plays the same old regular everyman character that he does in just about everything (Where is State of Play Jason, I liked that guy). Finally Charlie Day, as funny as he is on Its Always Sunny In Philadelphia seems  to shout his lines in hope that loud noises will be interpreted by the audience as amusing instead of just plain annoying.

There is lots of twists and turns in this surprising comedy. At first you'll think you know what's going to happen -- but wait, and watch the movie to the very end, including the credits. Several in this extraordinary cast (perhaps especially Jennifer Aniston) step outside their \"comfort zone\" and display aspects of their personalities and acting skills that may surprise you. The acting of the lead stars especially the bosses was so damned good that it actually carry the movie by itself. Horrible Bosses never takes itself seriously, but you'll be too deep into laughter to notice the difference. The movie is dark as the movie earned its R rating easily, but if you can handle it you are in for a uproarious ride. Keep an eye on this one, as it is one of the best summer surprises in recent years.",

I laughed twice, and looked at my watch at least 4 times wondering when it would end.  I admit, however, that other people in the audience were laughing a lot more than I was, so others liked it more than I did.  I also have to say that all the guest stars seemed to be having fun.  Kevin Spacey in particular seemed to revel in his bad guy persona.  Colin Farrell wasn't used enough, and Jennifer Anniston looked like she was having fun.  Too bad the writing just wasn't up to par for me.  Example - how many times have we seen someone find a container of cocaine and either drop it or sneeze on it?  The whole movie was unoriginal and predictable like that.  And VERY sitcomy.  People don't act like this in real life.",

While the movie was much more humorous and enjoyable when the protagonists and their jokes were underplayed and cleverly placed.

Sure, I laughed here and there but in all honesty this just wasn't as funny as it should have been, its very much a wasted oppertunity. The idea is so so ridiculous it gave them a chance to ring it out for all its worth but unfortunately they fall miserably short. The comedy threesome (Bateman, Day and Sudeikis) are probably like most people and hate their bosses but  these three are having an exceptionally difficult time. Bateman's psychotic boss is portrayed by Kevin Spacey and  robs him of a job he believes should be his, Day has the maneater Jennifer Aniston as his hot boss and makes his job a \"nightmare\" on a daily basis, yes I know get molested by Jennifer Aniston seems so bad? and Sudeikis is under employment of coke-head Colin Farrell. Actually, Farrell is a revelation and quite funny. But they deicde they've had enough and hatch a plan from \"m****r-f****r\" Jones (Jamiee Foxx) to kill their bosses. A problem I had was with the similarities between the three leads of this and a film some may of heard of in the Hangover, you have the crazy, mental one, the sensible grown up and mr cool. Sadly they don't have the same charisma or coolness of the Wolfpack but thats not to say they are bad by any strech of the imagination.

      "text": "In retrospect, we concur with Buddy Ackerman(Kevin Spacey), the movie mogul in \"Swimming with Sharks\", when he tells his disgruntled personal assistant to \"grow up\", because, culturally speaking, being a horrible boss is just par for the course in the movie biz. Bad behavior is just part of the culture. The flunky should know this. Upon its initial release, and the intervening years leading up to \"The Devil Wears Prada\", in essence, the female version of this \"Player(The)\" rethink, the moviegoer, for the most part, sided with Guy, the beleaguered assistant driven to desperate measures, when during a home invasion, Buddy gets his comeuppance for treating the hard-working underling like dirt, with rope and a chair, and a gun that just might go off. But now, courtesy of Andy Sachs, Guy is seen in a different light; a whiner, just one big baby, since the assistant for Runway editor Miranda Priestly, who in the 2006 film, bends but never breaks, even when faced with the seemingly impossible task of securing an unpublished manuscript for the next \"Harry Potter\" book. Compared to that, Guy's assignment is a relative piece of cake. He lacks Andy's resourcefulness. She would know to hire a helicopter pilot in order to hunt down a  whitewater rafting client, somewhere in the Rockies. Guy just isn't cut out for the movie business. \"I want my life back,\" goes the sniveling ingrate, while he holds Buddy hostage in exactly the same housebound manner as the secretaries' handling of their immediate supervisor, Mr. Hart, in \"9 to 5\". Although he lacks the intestinal fortitude to be a movie executive, Guy climbs the corporate ladder, nevertheless, as a reward for sparing his boss' life(he shoots the girl instead), therefore taking the buddy system to surreal heights. Feeling like a woman in a steno pool, he kills Dawn as a way of overcompensating for his emasculated feelings. Conversely, Andy, despite going toe-to-toe with the reconstituted woman(read: masculine), parlays her success for naught. Even though Andy may be the heir apparent of Miranda's empire, she goes to work for a dying industry, but the journalist doesn't worship haute couture, whereas Guy loves the movies, and is dumbstruck by the film illiteracy of his colleagues, who know Shelly Winters only from \"The Poseidon Adventure\". Insidiously, the filmmaker assigns a director with the name of Foster Kane, as a way to implicate the moviegoer as complicit philistines. He knows that the reference to \"Citizen Kane\" will go undetected. Similarly, in \"Horrible Bosses\", Nick draws a complete blank when Kurt compares their murder plot to \"Strangers on a Train\", while Dale confuses the Hitchc*ck film with  \"Throw Momma from the Train\". To say the least, Kurt's analogizing of art and life is deeply flawed, but will anybody notice? In the 1951 thriller, it's not the bosses that Bruno and, arguably, Guy conspire to kill, but a domineering father and a promiscuous wife who won't give the tennis star a divorce. If these best of friends were to actually sit down and watch the movie, they would realize the fallacy in their thinking, since, as the title clearly articulates, the passengers are \"strangers\", not familiars, therefore, the proposed murder swap could easily be linked back to them. Does the filmmaker know this, or is the film as smart as its characters, and the baby sharks working under Guy who don't have the slightest apprehension of classic Hollywood? This misappropriated homage, to its credit, tweaks the plot points with some deftness, especially when Nick's boss(Spacey, again) discovers a lighter in his abode belonging to Kurt's boss, unwittingly planted by the unreliable film buff(as if fulfilling Bruno's plan to drop Guy's lighter at the crime scene), which propels the jealous husband(thinking that his wife is cheating) to gun down the idiot son of Kurt's mentor. Unfortunately, it lets the passed over VP candidate off the hook. Since the murder(regardless of its unexpected third party participation) is going to incriminate them anyway, it would have been a lot more interesting had Nick gotten out of the car. This raunchy, but ultimately tame comedy practically desecrates Hitch's good name by it the film's unwillingness to follow through with its lurid premise: What would drive an ordinary man to murder his boss? In \"Strangers on a Train\", Bruno feels double-crossed when Guy doesn't hold up his end of the deal. Arguably, he owes Bruno, since the film hints that the tennis star would have eventually done in the wife himself. \"Horrible Bosses\" isn't calibrated right. Unlike the other targets, Harken is truly horrible, making the game comic performances by Farrell and Aniston seem out of place. Given the chance, Nick would have slipped the rat poison in Pellitt's cocaine. He has a real axe to grind. Never mind the promotion. Things turn personal when the boss makes light of his grandmother's death.",

However, as I said, the acting is good and the writing is pretty solid as the film is actually pretty funny. I just wish it was a bit more grounded and played less like an alright network sitcom.
