Jodie Foster goes for the extreme the most, and comes away with the best of the 4 main performances. Instead of going for a War of the Roses level of domestic extremes, it's really a Virginia Woolf/Breakfast Club type movie where we aren't left with any major revelations, other than these are MISERABLE PEOPLE.

      "text": "Who's Afraid of the God of Carnage? would be an apt title for this film since it is reminiscent of  the Virginia Woolf play/film. Any film that takes place almost entirely in one room has to be be based on a play, and Carnage is no  exception. The four characters occasionally tread into the hallway and there's a trip to the bathroom, and that's it. The stage lends itself well to prolonged dialogues and dramatic monologues, but film demands some action.  The opening credits show the incident between the boys in the park; otherwise, the most action you'll see here is when Kate Winslet's character throws up all over uptight Jodie Foster's art books. Both actresses got nominated for a Golden Globe for best actress in a comedy, but there is not one line in this film that is even remotely humorous. The ancient Greek definition of comedy is any play that has a happy ending--Carnage still does not qualify. It has no ending at all. It seems to stop in the middle. We'll need a sequel to find out if the two boys ever reconciled like grown-ups or even to find out if the two marriages survived that disastrous encounter. At least Polanski remembered to tie up the loose end about the hamster--that was an enormous relief. In between the opening credits and the hamster, two civilized couples get together to talk about the fact that the son of Nancy and Alan Cowen (Kate Winslet and Christoph Waltz) bashed in the teeth of the son of Penelope and Michael Longstreet (John Reilly and Jodie Foster). The injuries are serious but will heal and perhaps will need some cosmetic surgery, but the boy will not be marked for life. The parents have the best of intentions--to reconcile with each other and set an example so that the boys will reconcile. The visiting parents of the offending boy are about to leave, twice, and the second time they make it to the elevator. By the end of the movie, you wish they had left, and there was no reason for them to be enticed back for a cup of coffee. It was an uncomfortable, unpleasant visit, and everyone wanted it to end, including the viewers. Instead it dragged on for eighty minutes, short for  most films but interminable in this film. The conversation starts out being politically correct but quickly deteriorates as both couples lose it, lash out at the other couple, and then spouses lash out at each other, and all the chinks in the armor of the holy institution of marriage get blown away so that there is no armor left, just the carnage.

Actually the response is par for the course, the film hinges on a more stringent time schedule (literally the exact time audience spends in front of the big screen), which is too featherweight to be considered seriously for the Oscar race (referring to other play-adapted Oscar dearest CLOSER 2004 or DOUBT 2008, both at least possess a decent time span), but which doesn't thwart all the fun one could obtain from a feature film. The disintegration of these two pairs of parents is intrigued bit by bit with derision, insult and disdain, the initial wrangle of two flatly unfamiliar couples are reflecting everyone's customary procedure of dealing with strangers, the approach of eclipsing others in a restrained manner in order not to break a fragile bottom line \u00e2",

However the general idea of the film as alluded to in the title is that even in the most civil of all surroundings, things can fall apart into absolute chaos and Polanski shows this thanks to some brilliant performances by all four actors (Jodie Foster, John C Reilly, Kate Winslet, Christophe Waltz) and some resourceful direction. The film works as a drama but at its heart it is a very dark comedy that is outrageously funny in the way it slowly destroys these four people. Waltz's antagonistic lawyer is married to Kate Winslets uptight investment banker and they are avoiding the fact that deep down they hate each other. Jodie Foster and John C Reilly are the more liberal couple but they too are burdened by problems which are only exacerbated by Waltz and Winslets presence. The whole film seems completely realistic aside from the eloquent play like dialogue with a decent amount of twists and turns to keep things trundling along. The film blends physical and spoken comedy really well with both Winslet and Waltz showing great skill at the physical gags. There are some pretty interesting themes during the film with the key one being everyone is unhappy about something, you just need to know how to exploit it. Fortunately Polanski and his skilled cast know exactly how leading to some unbearably funny moments. Even if they don't want to admit it, each character is a deeply horrible person and watching them attempt to avoid their baser instincts and put up a facade is absolutely delightful. In essence, Polanski has discovered a way to make watching couples fight through their issues in a very public and embarrassing way both entertaining and painfully funny, which is wonderful in comparison to reality where it is extremely uncomfortable",

Before long both couples devolve into bickering monsters who are arguably worse than the kids. Jodie Foster and John C. Reilly star as Penelope and Michael Longstreet, and Kate Winslet and Christopher Waltz fill the roles of Nancy and Alan Cowan. In short the Cowan child hit the Longstreet child with a stick and broke two of his teeth, though the general consensus is that either couple could be in the other's position. Penelope is introduced as a do-gooder type, while Michael seems ill-fit for the formality of the occasion; Nancy wants to end the matters quickly, and Alan is content to condescend when not being interrupted by his cell. The film proceeds as a comedy of manners and lack thereof, and its success is dependent on the performances. Both Foster and Reilly are adequate, but Winslet and Waltz steal the show. There is nothing in Carnage to suggest that it has been altered or improved for cinematic treatment; indeed it could be a filmed play, which may turn off many a viewer. That said it was rather enjoyable for its documentation of seemingly decent people indulging in indecency. It provides its capable cast with some great scenes. Its humor is brittle and caustic, and its characters are recognizably human. Chances are experienced moviegoers will know whether or not they want to see Carnage; those who want to see it will likely enjoy it.",

      "text": "This is definitely not a film for everyone. But it happens to be my type of movie. And I loved it. The level of pasive-agressiveness is crazy. I laughed way too much. All four actors are horribly magnificent (if you do watch the film, you'll understand why I use \"horribly\"). But Winslet and Waltz - I mean - what else can I say?. Roman Polanski did something incredible here. Same set, same four actors, the entire film. Just recently I found out this was based on a play. Now it makes sense. The dialogue really plays out like a play and it works out very well here. At 88 minutes, it manages to not tire. What's more, I didn't wanted it to end.",

      "text": "Adapted from a play, Carnage is set in a single room and is a dramatic and uproariously comical black comedy-drama from director Roman Polanski. Bringing together two couples who have to discuss an incident between their respective sons, the civilized encounter quickly turns nasty and shows the carnage of the situation between their sons. Opening wounds regarding their marriages, lives, and characters, the encounter soon descends into chaos with in-fighting and larger revelations about the world around us with the carnage extending far beyond expectations. Set in just the living room of one of the couple's homes with some scenes in the bathroom and hallway, the film is easily identified as a play, but is one hell of a play translated to film. One of the greatest accomplishments of the film, however, is how it characterizes each person. While the acting is exemplary, the characters are feasts for the eyes and have a lot of meat on their bones. This is largely examined when each is put on the hot seat and attacked by the other three people in the room, with the person on the hot seat constantly changing. What is crucial, however, is how fake each person is, which becomes apparent quite quickly.",
