The film does take some time to get rolling but I felt invested in most of the characters that were on the screen. This is because First Class and Days of Future past did such a wonderful job of setting certain characters up. McAvoy and Fassbender reprise their roles as Professor X and Magneto. Their chemistry is still strong and a great source of emotional investment. Jennifer Lawrence returns as Raven (Mystique) along with other familiar faces like Beast, Havoc, and Quicksilver. Quicksilver once again has a wonderful scene and I would go so far as to say it may even be better than the one in DoFP.",

Not much to say other than that, but for people that don't see how obviously stupid this film is let me explain to you why. Actors were bored out of their minds and it showed in every single scene. The script is full of hyperbole and couldn't amuse a child. The cinematography and over all visual style lacked detail and originality and all too often it came off looking like a cartoon. The CGI that permeated almost every single scent made the film look cheap, despite the film costing an insane amount of money. They could have saved a lot of money and gone with stop motion animation and miniatures and it would have looked way better. The characters are all one dimensional and very boring. The film over and over attempted to force you to feel something with visuals and music, instead of having a story and a script that would actually make you feel something. The emotional manipulation was extremely obvious and cheesy beyond belief. I think the real issue is that they are trying to get new viewers, they are catering to the young adult crowed, instead of making a film for the original fans, who are all in their 30s and 40s, who would demand something more sophisticated and emotionally real. This young adult genre of films is a huge cash cow, but ultimately produces nothing worth anyone's time. Don't waste your brain cells on this producer driven shell of a film.",

This film has been called the worst X-Men film ever, nothing is worse than Last Stand, and as far as violence towards woman goes, there has always been fight scenes and there have always been male and female characters involved, in fact, X-Men has always received high praise for included female characters as equals, since the very beginning, so what is it, they aren't allowed to lose a fight? As far as the film goes, the story was terrific, the action sequences and special effects just continue to get better, and the introduction of Cyclopes (Tye Sheridan) and Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit-Mcfee) into the prequel cast just made everything that much better. Without giving anything away, I will say that my one knock on the film would be in the ending. There was so much build-up around the character of Apocalypse and so much talk about how powerful he was. Half the film follows him as he gains power and puts his plan together, but the final battle, that determines the outcome of the film, didn't take very long at all. There was all this hype and build up to this ultimate battle, that could determine the fate of the world, and when it happened, the fans were left scratching their heads by how quickly it ended. Hopefully it was all done with a purpose, and we'll find out why in whatever comes next, but as it stands now, the ending of the film was extremely anti-climatic, besides that, I loved it! Apocalypse might not have been as good as First Class or Days of Future Past, but it certainly wasn't a stinker on the level of Last Stand, the way that most critics portrayed it to be.",

      "text": "There's a whole bunch of reasons why X-Men:Apocalypse is such a terrible horrible mess of a movie. It could be because all of the characters are severely under-developed to the point that no one cares what happens to them. Quicksilver, Psylocke, Angel, NightCrawler, Havok, Cyclops, Jean Grey, Storm. These are all characters that we met in the film but were not explained at all or nearly enough for anyone to care about them. Psylocke (Olivia Munn) looked great. Ok, she looked like Olivia Munn cosplaying as Psylocke which if you know Olivia Munn isn't actually that amazing, since it's sorta her thing. However, I can't recall her having more than a couple of lines in the film and most of the time she was just standing around as a background lackey. Not much different from Storm and Angel, the other so-called \"four horsemen\" of Apocalypse (the 4th being Magneto).  At some point in the film Quicksilver randomly shows up and does something super cool....the best sequence of the film actually.....but unfortunately as a result of what happened, someone who is supposed to be a major character but didn't get any film time died. I'm shedding a tear as we speak. Of course, this film is called \"X-men: Apocalypse\" and so if I didn't talk about the blue guy himself, it just wouldn't be right. Ah, Apocalypse. What the hell happened to you? People who don't read X-Men comics, read the following words carefully: Apocalypse is one of the scariest mofos in the Marvel Universe. He is a villain that causes superheroes to crap their pants when he shows up looking to cause trouble. This is a guy who is so evil, so powerful, so insane...that he has tortured and massacred some of the most well known X-Men in the past and literally changed the entire timeline of the Marvel Universe for awhile (see Age of Apocalypse). Now, with that in mind, WTF was Singer thinking when he gave us....this....this....ugly blue guy in horrible looking samurai armor? This film's Apocalypse is nothing compared to the Apocalypse of the Marvel Universe. This film's Apocalypse looks like a mutant Smurf that's been drinking one too many potions in Gargamel's laboratory. He's small, he's puny, he's ridiculous. I did not feel like the X-Men were in danger when I saw him on screen. Everytime I saw him, I couldn't help but laugh. He didn't strike fear or terror or make me anxious to see what happens next. All I could think about was how stupid he looked and acted. Ooooh, I'm going to destroy the world and rebuild it the way I like. Great plan, buddy. Because 20,000 villains before you haven't had the same plan and pulled it off successfully, right? That's not Apocalypse's M.O. And the way that they defeated him. Really? This isn't a spoiler by the way. I mean it's an \"X-Men\" movie. Obviously the X-Men are going to win, right? But the way he was defeated was so ridiculous and so easy compared to what other things the X-Men have gone up against that it was a total waste of time for them and completely negated any idea that Apocalypse was powerful and menacing in the first place. C'mon, Singer if you're going to churn out crap like this then man up and give the property back to Marvel so they can atleast do something respectable with it.",

After the promising return to form that was delivered with Days of Future Past, this one gets too many things wrong. An uneven plot, overabundance of characters, and a weak and uninspired villain are just a few things that held the film back. In addition, this film must have been looking to Batman v. Superman for examples on what to do, because much like that film, this film delivered a nonstop amount of action, especially in the third act to the point of being just plain underwhelming! Honestly, it feels like Captain America: Civil War has been the only superhero film so far this year to get everything right! Overall, while it was nice to see many of the characters again, it's not enough to make up for the mess of a film that this was, as it's simply too long, too drawn-out, and too underwhelming as a result.",

Furthermore, the fact that the movie had explain who and what he was took away from the story. I liked the Ancient Egypt, beginning sequence and the transference of the consciousness of the ancient being to the new body was interesting. Throwing in the Logan/Wolverine cameo was great. The rest of the movies and character developments were lukewarm and that  might have been, because they had to develop so many of them.

      "text": "\"X-Men Apocalypse\" is one of the most polarizing films I had seen in a long time. The things it does well is very inspired but everything it does wrong really drag it down to a mixed bag instead of a satisfying entry in  the series. For instance the titular villain Apocalypse was not that interesting. He is really nothing more than an obstacle for the X-Men to overcome instead of a compelling antagonist in his own right. Granted the character in the comics was also a generic villain but the film would have benefited from a needed update to give him more depth. Oscar Issac does deserve credit by capturing a presence on screen but it is a real shame that the way his character was written was not that engaging. Aside from Magneto the rest of the horsemen were barely developed. Storm in particular was very underutilized as her powers were only used to produce lightning instead of using the full power that she is known for. The reason for her inclusion to the Horsemen was rushed at best since her reasoning for joining the Horsemen was no where near developed as it could have been. Angle has it worse since the original character tried to live up to his namesake but is guilty for committing human errors. The Angle in this film is a generic bad boy who is only there to be a rival for Nightcrawler. Magneto's character arc was revolved way to quickly as he just helps the X-Men for the sake of convenience. There is also a subplot involving Wolverine which could have been cut from the film and it would not have made a difference. It is obvious that he wasn't meant to be in this film but was thrown in at the last minute to satisfy the producers. Characters move back and forth like Jean Grey and Cyclops just fell for each other. Nightcrawler is utilized well but he is barely given enough screen time and the death of Havoc felt like a cheap ploy instead of a carefully crafted tragedy. Despite these glaring issues there are some things it does really well. The scenes with Magneto trying to reform was really well done. They were compelling to watch as he tries to fit into society and start anew as a family man in Poland. The death of his Wife and Daughter was heart-breaking and the tragedy was reinforced when the police officer showed genuine remorse for his action. The scene with Quicksilver was the rare instance with lightning striking twice. The super speed is more impressive than in the previous film. James McAvoy is once again a great young Xavier and Jennifer Lawrence once again captures the essence of Mystique and even becomes a new leader for the X-Men. I am not sure those elements are enough to save this film from mediocrity though since it is clear that this was not made with a singular vision. I would recommend this film to those who just want to see an action movie for the weekend but if you are a die-hard X-Men fan like I am than you are more likely to be dissapointed.",

But besides that every performance is amazing, the reintroduction to characters like Jean, Scout, Night-crawler are awesome and it's great to see them back *even with different actors* Its just a really entertaining film. Personally my biggest complaint is just Apocalypse, hes just not a very menacing or interesting villain, he's just a really kinda goofy big macho big baddy that feels strangely out of place in this film franchise, especially at how emotionally gripping it can be at times thanks to magnetos character it kinda feels really awkward having this big blue mutant thing walking around who can turn people into sand. I enjoyed the film for what it was, but I really wish the film had more focus. Also i really wish Apocalypse was a better fleshed out character and had more reasoning and depth behind his motives.

It\u2019s ok but I wouldn\u2019t mind if this is the final movie cause this franchise is kinda running dry now and there\u2019s only so much more of the source material to work with. Though I would be willing to return for another sequel which is planned at this time.",

The story still focuses on the three main characters - Xavier (Professor X), Erik (Magneto) and Raven (Mystique), all deliver promisingly just as previous installments that leads to a very engaging chemistry together with powerful scores by John Ottman, visually stunning effects and a number of fun moments delivered by both Professor X and Quicksilver (although the latter seems to steal the attention much better in two major scenes).

However, as a casual moviegoer, there lies quite a few problems, rendering it to mixed reviews and being the second lowest rated film (on Rotten Tomatoes) in the entire series. There weren't enough fights between the X-Men and Apocalypse, who again, sounded repetitive and boring most of the time. A lot of key X-Men themes were touched on and never explored again in the film. There was an obvious focus on the future of the X-Men series, rather than the Apocalypse they're facing now. It just didn't seem like the end of the world was near, and that is where my main problem lies with this movie. The inevitable comparisons to Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and Captain America: Civil War places this movie right in the middle. Apocalypse definitely accomplished more than Batman v Superman but it didn't deliver as well as Civil War did. All in all, X-Men: Apocalypse is a must see movie.

Man is 2016 rocking it with those superhero movies. The only thing I could say slightly negative about this film was the film length as it was a bit too long, just like any Marvel movie. If you loved X-Men:Days of Future Past (I didn't particularly love that film, but it was okay), then you should like this movie. Go see it and support it as my theater had less people watching this than Captain America: Civil Warm, yet still being nearly full. I really hope this film does well and I look forward to watching it again in DVD. (98/100)",

It felt nice having a villain other than Magneto as the central protagonist but with that said, I expected more from Apocalypse. Also, a few more minutes of his backstory would not have hurt the movie time wise at all. It was also a relief not having Wolverine as the focal point and rather reduced to a cameo/action scene. The acting from the cast is surely not Oscar worthy but they get the job done. All in all, if you're looking for an enjoyable movie with a decent story then check this out. But like I said, do not expect this to be the greatest comic book movie ever.",

The story was cool, new characters were pretty evenly introduced, the sights and sounds were phenomenal, and there is a lot of room for the next installment in the series! The only problems I really felt were timing and pacing issues. There were times when the movie felt like it was throwing a lot at you in a small amount of time, but as it went on I felt everything was explained pretty well. Also, it was pretty nice knowing about the X-Men before seeing this movie, but I feel people that don't know too much about X-Men can enjoy this movie just as much as I did. If you like X-Men or comic book movies in general I highly recommend X-Men Apocalypse!",

To which Apocalypse arose from his slumber with no thanks to Moira, began to find himself in the new world, planning world domination and unleashing chaos & mass destruction with assistance of newly recruited 4 Horsemen,including Psylocke & Angel (sadly downplayed), with wandering lost souls, Storm & Magneto, on the verge of giving up hope on humanity, facing conflict upon questioning their leader's true motives. Following the abduction of Charles Xavier, Mystique & Beast are left with no choice but to take over leading the new X-students on a rescue mission. From this point, the flow becomes sloppy which seems rushing right into final battle, witnessing the start of chaos destruction overloading with too much CGI. Oscar Issac is an amazing character however not as menacing as fearful as we thought to portray according to the comics. Wasn't much into Wolverine's cameo sequence, probably ruined due to major spoiler revealed on the final trailer... Funny how at one point in the film, where the X-students exit from the mall, with Jean making a comment on how the 3rd movie is the worst which totally suck, ref to Star Wars: Return of the Jedi, while in reality, takes a jab towards the dismal 3rd X-movie 'The Last Stand' (2006). Makes one wonder as the irony being the 3rd film of the reboot trilogy since First Class (2011) is following suit. 3.5/5 Rating! It's just a good movie, but not great enough, measuring up the expectations of predecessor's success & box office smash 'Days of Future Past' (2014). Recommended!",

The movie had some redeeming qualities although, I found Apocalypse to be well done, Hugh Jackmen as Wolverine was a welcomed sight and the performaces of Michael Fassbender, James McAvoy and Even Peters really redeemed the film in alot of ways. While it does have some moments, the film is obviously the product of a poor script, editing and direction, which is disappointing, because it could have and really should have been a better follow up to Days of Future Past and Deadpool",

It stars James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence, Oscar Isaac, Nicholas Hoult, Rose Byrne, Tye Sheridan, Sophie Turner, Olivia Munn and Lucas Till. In Apocalypse, the ancient mutant En Sabah Nur awakens in 1983 and plans to wipe out modern civilization and take over the world, leading the X-Men to try to stop him and defeat his team of renegade mutants. I personally loved this movie from beginning to the end. I started to get emotionally invested from the Magneto scene in the woods, and from then on it was just a thrill ride. The acting is absolutely great from everyone, starting with the always amazing Michael Fassbender, who is exceptional on the role as always. The newcomers all do a really good job with the stand out, Sophie Turner who definitely does not disappoint in the iconic role. Apocalypse, played by Oscar Isaac who is taking over the world by storm (in this movie quiet literally), looks really good on screen, and the acting by Oscar is fine and serviceable. What irritated me the most were the special effects, which certainly could and should have been better. Even First Class had better effects than Apocalypse, I mean it's not all bad, there are scene that are great to look at but sometimes it just lost me on all the obvious green screen. The music is undeniably good though, the main theme is great and memorable. It does also feel a bit too long, especially with all the leading up scenes, but overall this is a really well made and absolutely fun entry in the X-Men franchise. The new trilogy, First Class, Days of Future Past and Apocalypse, is most certainly one of the best superhero trilogies there are.",

Now, yes, he was a bit, but thanks to Oscar Isaac's menacing performance, he still serves his purpose. I did find it a tad overstuffed -Rose Byrne's character didn't really need to be in it- but all flaws aside, it was still very enjoyable. The new characters such as Nightcrawler were great, and it brings the \"First Class\" trilogy to a satisfying close.

Leaving the world's first mutant asleep for eras. After the introduction of Apocalypse concludes, the film piggybacks right where they left off after the events of 'Days of Future Past'. We get glimpses of where Erik/Magneto (Michael Fassbender) is now hiding out, away from society. Glimpses of the bustling School for Gifted Youngsters, which is housing plenty of familiar mutants including Charles Xavier (James McAvoy), Hank McCoy (Nicholas Hoult), Jean Grey (Sophie Turner), and many more of which we are introduced/re-introduced to throughout the movie. We also get our first \"new\" glimpse of Scott Summers (Tye Sheridan) as he has his first run-in with his gift. Which results in him being taken to Xavier's school, accompanied by his older brother Alex Summers (Lucas Till). Lastly, we get a glimpse of the whereabouts of Raven/Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) as she is out saving mutants who have been exposed to the brutal world.",

In fact, the first act is a chore to watch oftentimes because it has nothing of much interest to show the audience. Also, some of the conflicts it wants to portray have been done in a previous X-Men movie.

In Apocalypse, the world's first and most powerful mutant, aptly named Apocalypse, has woken up from a slumber after thousands of years to find that society is not revering him as a god as they used to. Apocalypse throws a tantrum and assembles a team of four mutants to destroy modern civilization and create a new world order. As the fate of the world hangs in the balance, Mystique and Professor X assemble a new team of young mutants to save mankind. It seemed like having God and the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse be the villains would make the movie at least somewhat interesting, but, really they don't do anything for a majority of the 144 minute running time. For most of Apocalypse's story, he's just assembling his team while the Horsemen he's already recruited just sit around while he convinces another mutant to join the group. That's not only an issue with the Horsemen, unfortunately. Almost all of the other mutants, Mystique, Professor X, Nightcrawler, Jean Grey, etc, wait around until something bad happens. There's a ton of interesting characters in this film that aren't given anything interesting to do. Almost all of the mutants spend the entire movie feeling sorry for themselves, and there's really no good action until the very end. Even the final fight scene gets underwhelming at certain points. At times, I felt like I was watching a bad Roland Emmerich disaster flick. One positive is that Evan Peters steals every scene as Quicksilver, giving a great personality to the character. He was the one thing I wholeheartedly enjoyed about the movie. X-Men: Apocalypse has a couple moments of visual flair, some decent action and clear ambition, but its muddled plot and bland characterizations make it a disappointing misstep.",

It is by no means the worst instalment in the franchise, but after First Class and Days of Future Past I expected much more than Sailor-Moon-like finale and some Polish actors butchering what shoud be the most engrossing scene in the film (hey, I'm Polish, I can tell). It's all pretty and flashy, but nothing more than that.",

There are moments in this movie that are absolutely wonderful and others that were just there.   And, really, that's the biggest problem with this movie:  there's just too much going on.  During the first third of the movie I felt like I was watching a collection of scenes, not a coherent story.  It also means that parts that should have been focused on are sometimes glossed over. I get what they were trying to do with the film, but they don't quite pull it off.  In the end, it's a decent but very flawed movie.",
