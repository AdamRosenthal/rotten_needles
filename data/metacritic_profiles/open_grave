The first part of the movie is moody and creepy and the second part is suspenseful. I'm not sure I understand the critics' criticisms.  There isn't tremendous depth to the characters but who cares? That's not what this sort of movie is at all about. The plot twist was perfectly acceptable IMO.",

I\u2019m a big fan of Sharlto Copley so I went into this movie knowing nothing more than he was in it and that it was a thriller.  However, I was pleasantly surprised with the film thanks to great performances, an engaging story and a nice twist ending that takes a way too familiar genre of this day and makes it unique and new.",
