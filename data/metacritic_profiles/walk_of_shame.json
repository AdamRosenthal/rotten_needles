Well in this film she didn't have to because the supporting cast around her was absolutely amazing and the hilarity of each moment in the film's plot progression was just great. James Marsden, Gillian Jacobs, and Sarah Wright were all fantastic and then factor in the comedic genius of Bill Burr and Alphonso McAuley and the cast was just fantastic from top to bottom. Is this raunchy comedy going to be for everyone? No, it's not. It's more of a guy's style comedy film with a female lead, which is probably why it didn't kill it in the box office or why the closed minded critics didn't understand it. That being said, if you have enjoyed previous Elizabeth Banks films, you'll certainly get some quality laughs here.",
