Think \"Eraserhead\", for example. The acting, for the most part, is top-notch. Brenton Thwaites, hot off the set of \"Oculus\", gives a very compelling performance, and Laurence Fishburne puts on his best Morpheus impression to unsettling results. The film starts out as a road-trip movie until it's turned upside-down into a sort of jail-break type movie. The first half of the film is very mysterious and intriguing while the second half is more intense. The special effects and cinematography look amazing; you wouldn't tell that its budget is a meager 4 million dollars. Some ideas become as lost as our main characters at points, however, and the ending isn't as mind-blowing as the film let on. If you're used to big-budget action-packed sci-fi films, stay far away from this film. However, if you enjoy slow-burners with interesting ideas, don't miss this one.",

      "text": "What do I say about this movie that will make any sense at all?  I've read a review that it is easy to correctly guess the ending before actually coming to it, but I did not find that to be the case.  Perhaps it's because I didn't want to look to closely for fear that it would ruin my enjoyment of the film.  Despite myself, I was entertained watching it.  It's pace is a bit methodical, deliberate...I'm trying not to use the word \"slow.\"  I can respond to a slow movies if there is enough to keep me interested, and there was enough to seduce me.  I feel like, upon retrospection, the director was toying with how far he could take this movie out of the realm of reality or possibility and still hold the audience.  He held me to the end.  Hallelujah.   But he didn't hold my attention on the strength of the \"plot\" or narrative.  He took me there on the shoulders of good acting, (spotty) suspense. and beautiful cinematography.  I'd have to be selective to whom I would recommend this movie.  To those who don't need things blowing up or women and children in jeopardy every 5 minutes, or those who feel that Keanu Reeves, Arnold Schwarzenegger  or Robert Pattinson are not actually ACTING, I would recommend it.  Postscript:  I actually have liked quite a few of the movies that 2 out of the aforementioned \"actors\" have starred in.",

On the other hand, I was sometimes arrested by some of the wonderful images in the film. What this director needs to do is sit down and suffer like the rest of us (but multiple times) and figure out with brutal honesty what he did right and what he did wrong. There is obvious talent here, but sometimes this film is so dull that you never want to see another movie (at least by this person and with these actors) for the rest of your life.
