      "text": "Is vehicular manslaughter murder, like a stabbing, or pulling the trigger aimed at somebody's chest? Filmically, the answer varies. If you asked the defense attorney in \"A Time to Kill\", the question as to whether drunk driving is a punishable crime or not, the equivalent or subordinate of first-degree murder, he would state that it largely depends on the person behind the wheel. After all, \"the eyes of the law are human eyes,\" argues Jack Tyler Brigance, whose observance is made in a racial context from a southern courtroom where he calls attention to the region's biases that often perverts the system of the law. The victory he scores for the client, plaintiff Carl Lee Haley, a paper mill worker, who, from the town's perspective, has the nerve to bring charges against some \"good 'ol boys\" for the vicious rape and attempted hanging of his daughter, seems to hail from another Mississippi, another earth, because in real life, a stirring closing argument wouldn't change people's fundamental principles overnight. Rhoda Williams lives on our earth, not the diegetical blue planet where the case particulars of  \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" unfolds in a way at all favorable to Tom Robinson chances for an acquittal. In both \"A Time to Kill\" and the classic film(adapted from the Harper Lee novel), the courtroom is presented as a legal utopia, which for the ethnically disadvantaged facing charges of some sort, misrepresents their reality to a great degree. The filmmaker rigs the protagonist's outcome, reflecting, day in and day out, our legal mores. To celebrate her MIT acceptance, the aspiring astrophysicist, after a hard night of partying, gets into her car and doesn't see the idling sedan at the stoplight, killing the family inside, save for the driver, who for all intents and purposes, died along with his wife, pregnant with their second child, and young son, on that fated road. Instead of college, Rhoda spends her matriculating years locked up in a state penitentiary. Upon her release, having served a four-year(!) sentence, the ex-felon staves off our contempt by looking appropriately sad and withdrawn. To boot, she has the decency to overextend her prison sentence(a mental one) by doing penance in a high school, where she works as an angst-ridden janitor. The filmmaker wants us to see a remorseful young woman, not a murderer. She did her time, so now it's a time to heal, but shouldn't we hold off on absolving Rhoda of her terrible mistake until the widower, John Burroughs, the man who lost everything, absolves her first? From his perspective, he's like the parents from \"Last House on the Left\", in the sense that the accomplished composer and music professor unwittingly invites the murderer into his house. Posing as a door-to-door representative for a maid service company, little does the Yale-ite know that her specialty is crime scene cleanup(ala Amy Adams and Emily Blunt in \"Sunshine Cleaning), so while the impostor can't make the blood disappear, she can hide the bodies, metaphorically speaking, when the killer washes away the smell from his client's wife's sweater, causing the husband to mourn a smaller yet equally devastating death in its own right.  Although Rhoda isn't consciously trying to replace Maya(arguably), this incident of spousal erasure serves as a turning point to just such an unseemly perception, exacerbated by their age difference, which corresponds to that of a professor and his comely grad student. In another earth, they'd be carrying on some torrid off-campus affair. Now here's the argument. Just prior to her laundry faux pas, Rhoda shares with John the story of a Russian cosmonaut who's confronted by a tapping sound in space that nearly drives him mad. For his own sanity, she explains, the spaceman learns to love the constant ticking. As Rhoda taps the kitchen table with a tuning fork, the noise may remind some of a heartbeat, like in the Poe short story \"The Tell-Tale Heart\", but in Rhoda's version(subtextually compartmentalized), the dead person lying underneath the floorboards is a wife. Does Rhoda identify with the cosmonaut, who no longer hears the ticking, but only music, \"and spends the rest of his time in total bliss and peace,\" which would suggest that she has forgiven herself, whereas the narrator(in Poe's tale), wracked with guilt, confesses to the crime. In \"Last House on the Left\", the dead girl's father avenges his daughter's systematic slaying by driving a chainsaw  through her killer's chest. \"Another Earth\", on the other hand, doesn't perceive Rhoda in those terms, a murderer, as evidenced by the saw that John performs with(not kills with), when he executes an avant-garde piece for Rhoda in an empty concert hall. To the actors' credit, they portray their damaged characters so persuasively, you forget that they can't be together. \"Another Earth\" makes us love Rhoda. \"Now imagine if she's...,\" to paraphrase the lawyer.",

Now after four-year sentence, Rhoda with her guilt tries to approach the frustrated John to ask for forgiveness. I will not tell you where the rest will lead us. The story centers on two main characters, Rhoda (Brit Marling) and john (William Mapother). Brit Marling made her acting debut through thiz movie. She can show her vulnerable emotion convincingly. William Mapother also made a good balance on their interaction. Even though first-time feature Director Mike Cahill has very limited resources, he seems so successful to raise a debate among the audience with his unique story. I realize that thiz movie has an ambiguous ending. It means the ending could mean anything depends on how the content is interpreted by the viewers. Thiz kind of art house movie reminds me of Spike Jonze and Charlie Kaufman strange smart movies like in BEING JOHN MALKOVICH (1999), ADAPTATION (2002), ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND (2004), SYNECDOCHE, NEW YORK (2008) or WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE (2009). I think thiz movie is a large-scale metaphor of life. It is straightly about how to redeem a guilty feeling. Certainly, we cannot change the past. So the movie reminds us of the importance of forgiveness. To put it simply, if you want to make people around you to feel happiness then you have to make yourself happy first. Otherwise, if you want to make yourself to be happy, then you have to make other people happy. We are all in the same boat. It is a good contemplation.",

Mostly spellbinding, once you let yourself get drawn in and stop trying to rationalize the \"other world\" element.  Oh, and it's not a space adventure.  Very much enjoyed the experience.",

Then it happened and I actually had to get up and do something. I fast forwarded to the end to see the last bit, a borderline criminal thing to do, but I was disappointed enough to do it. I had wasted an hour already and I'll be damned if I'm denied the ending. I'm glad I skipped to the end though, so I could be all snarky at the \"cliffhanger\" ending letting out a glorious scoff of superiority. I've never made a film.",

      "text": "This is brilliant, the colour, feel, thoughtfulness. So much obviously went into the first second to the last, the late night discussions creating ideas then bringing it into a narrative world that was real, to locations, gestures, expressions. The concept is genius and I wish someone see's the passion of my review and is inspired to watch this and then even if you don't like it, you'll have experienced something, just don't watch and then give a negative review if you know full well it's an independent fiction film,.. I suspect the same score trolling doesn't take place on Transformers. To do all that work then to pitch this concept to someone to distribute when the world wasn't looking for this oeuvre yet... although Netflix is now driving the one a month requests we're getting more but nothing of this level of excellence.",
