I mean, this is truly one of the best movies that I have ever seen, and one that I will tell all my friends to watch. The tension and the unique atmosphere it builds is truly remarkable, the lead actor who I never even heard of before gave an astonishing performance. And don't even get me started on the soundtrack. Great movie, don't miss it!",

Great lead acting, amazing score, and such a playful, fun tone to it that you don't get bogged down in the extreme violence. Highly recommended at the end of a tough summer for mainstream flicks.",

Dan Stevens is fantastic in the lead role, while Maika Monroe turns in a supporting performance that provides further proof of her brilliance.

It's like watching a classic action film which that's what I liked. The movie goes downhill for me like in the middle of the film. For example when he was going to buy the guns and turns out that he kills the two guys. That scene dropped for me. But one good thing that saved this film before I almost hated it is the suspense and the surprises that I got.",

The final act of the movie feels quite different to the opening act and is justifiably divisive, but I didn't mind that much. I loved Drive and the original Terminator so I'm glad I heard about The Guest. Shame it didn't come out in my local cinema.",
