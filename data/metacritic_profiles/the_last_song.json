      "text": "Typical Sparks story. Girl meets boy, they fall in love unrealistically fast, then tragedy strikes, yanking cheap sobs out of you. My first complaint about this movie is Miley Cyrus. Sparks says he wrote the screen play and the novel for her, which makes me question his sanity. With Cyrus doing the best she can to deliver the completely over the top typical-teen lines, it's just painful to watch. Then, when she meets Will (played by Liam Hemsworth) she is first cold to him, but then after going on one date with him she is all of a sudden in love with him - it didn't really make sense. This movie moves way too fast, I didn't even feel like I got to know the characters by the time the film was over(Although by the expression Cyrus's character wore on her face the entire time, I'm not sure I would want to) and it moves from scene to scene in an extremely choppy manner. Not even Greg Kinnear could save this tragedy of a film.",
