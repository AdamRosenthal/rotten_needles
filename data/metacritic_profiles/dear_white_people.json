The rest takes a satirical, but serious look at racial dynamics, college politics and personal relationships. It's set at a fictional college where residential hall rivalries cause conflict. Surprisingly, in all the cultural discussion, there's a positive subplot about gay issues. The performances are genuine, but writer/director Justin Simien holds too tightly to his messages, which gives the dialogue too much didactic weight. Young people might enjoy the MTV-tinged drama, but don't go expecting lots of laffs.",

      "text": "I was really excited to watch \u201cDear White People\u201d because there would finally was be a film that would spark a discussion on race.  I love how the film focuses on issues of not only race but sexual orientation, and general stereotyping as well.  Throughout the movie, a lot of great topics were touched, but I feel that the delivery was very poor and the story-line was a little confusing. At the end of watching the movie, I\u2019m sad to say that, I questioned what the ultimate message was. Yes, the movie did touch on many issues on race but I wish that they would have focused more on why these issues exist and how we can solve the problem. I appreciate the humor throughout the movie but I feel that this movie seemed to be making fun of black issues rather than coming from a more serious approach. At the end of the movie, even as a black woman, I felt racism wasn't a serious reality for most and instead it\u2019s something \u201cfunny\u201d.  Many may disagree that the movie should have gone deeper and focused more on the struggles of racism, from a more serious approach, so that viewers could leave the theaters more willing for a change. It\u2019s up to you to watch the film and see if you agree with this statement or not.",

Not surprisingly, I did in fact enjoy the movie. Personally, I think it was clever, motivational, funny and educational all at the same time.

I felt that the early scenes of the movie was where the movie was the strongest.  As a viewer It was easy for me to understand the plights of each of the four main characters on which the movie was focused on.  All of the actors performances were full of emotion and feeling, everyone carried their own.  As someone who doesn't pay as much attention as he probably should to issues of discrimination and prejudice, this film portrayed, and introduced a variety of issues in a way that I was able to quickly grasp and understand.  Instead of blatantly stating what part of Black culture that a character was supposed to represent, the film used context and imagery to achieve the same message.  The bread and butter of the film was showing the interactions and experiences that people of certain groups and orientations go through and what they feel during these events.  The film was also very friendly in its presentation and did not at all during any moment, come off as preachy or oppressive.  However, I thought that it was perhaps a little too friendly.  Instead of taking the opportunity to enlighten the viewer on some issues the movie read more like a safe and formulaic story.  The plot line was also a bit hard to follow because the story felt so much like simple life events.  Thats not to say that it was bad, its just not the usual overstimulating action flick that I would usually go see.  In conclusion, the movie was great, the actors were on point, the cinematography was quirky, and the story was educational for me but I somehow expected to see a more provocative film.  It was a movie that I strongly recommend you go see in theaters but I don't recommend that you buy on DVD.",
