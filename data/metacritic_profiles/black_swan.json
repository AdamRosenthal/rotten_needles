Not only does Portman shine, but so does the supporting cast, especially Barbara Hershey and Mila Kunis. With many fantastical aspects to the film, it is somewhat confusing and keeps one on the edge of their seat, since we never know what is really happening with Nina (Portman) and her surrounding.

While you have Mila Kunis who is more bubbly and willing to do anything. Winona Ryder is in the film but seems like she was dying. Couldn't tell if it was her or the character. Vincent Cassel is also pretty good as he pushes Portman's character to be the best. The film really has a dark feel to it showing how the mind can warp reality and take control. If you are not a fan of the theater, when you here Swan Lake, you think boring.

What did, was that as a portrayal of anything faintly human, there was nothing but ridiculous pastiches of human beings. The premise of the film is the extreme suffering and destructive forces a person must endure to achieve their artistic goals. While there is truth in the idea that one must suffer for their art, or to excel in anything, this idea is explored in a crude and superficial way. Black Swan trades on a romanticized view of the 'high art' ballet world, and on the idea of the mysterious and mad artist perusing perfection at the expensive of their sanity. This is itself just another clich\u00c3\u00a9, and an approach that makes the most of the cultural myth of the tortured and illusory artist engrossed in an exotic and unhinged life. While this idea may be seductive to some judging from the many favourable reviews, if you are not sucked in by the shallow illusion, all that is left is affected banality. In time I think this film will come to be seen in a less favourable light.",

I love Vincent Cassel, but here he's wasted as one more catalyst for the flowering of Natalie Portman's neurosis into capital-A Art.  It's interesting to me that Winona Ryder showed up as the has-been dancer because Portman seemed to base her character on the timid mental patient Ryder played in \"Girl, Interrupted\" (watchable only for Angelina Jolie's much more dynamic sociopath).  The difference here is that we experience manifestations of Portman's disintigration and are clearly supposed to wonder whether she is, in fact, being sabotaged.  That would be the thriller part.  But it's evident from the first 10 minutes of the movie that this chick is way too screwed up for anyone to bother sabotaging; all an intelligent rival would have to do is stand around, smoke a cigarette or two, and wait for her to self-destruct.  So \"thrills,\" for me, along with surprises, were in pretty short supply.  I was mildly interested in how she'd finally sex up her Black Swan (hint: no sex involved) but rolled my eyes when it finally happened.  I'm happy for all the people who swooned with delight at this film, but I was definitely not one of them.  Plusses: some nice dancing.

I mean, the whole movie is about Nina and how she descends into madness. And that's it. Everything else are just fillers. The ballet dancing, sure, it was great and Natalie Portman did a splendid job. There were, what I would consider \"unnecessary\" scenes that contributed much to the film's age viewing classification. Hmm... I don't quite know how to put this but we don't really get to see much love towards the \"art of ballet\" instead we get a tortured soul that happens to be in ballet. We never get to see Nina loving ballet. We just see her desire to be perfect. This is not a bad film, not it is definitely not. But it is not as good as I thought. I don't believe this film will bag the Best Picture Oscar, but Natalie Portman, sure, she will for Best Actress in a Leading Role.",

      "text": "Coming from a successful award circuit with The Wrestler - which consequently restarted Mickey Rourke's acting career - director Darren Aronofsky returns with the ballet-based psychological thriller Black Swan. Following in the footsteps of Aronofsky's previous films (Pi, Requiem For A Dream), Black Swan is a dark psychological nightmare with disturbing cinematography that freely crawls underneath the skin of its audience.  In his newest venture,  it seems as if Aronofsky took stylistic notes from Jean-Luc Godard and at the same time attempted to make a vague statement.  Essentially, Black Swan is a film that has too much style rather than its implied substance. Like The Wrestler, Black Swan converges most of its attention onto a single character. Natalie Portman strays from her archetypal roles and impeccably plays the innocent character of Nina; an aspiring ballerina who receives the star role of the \"Swan Queen\" in an upcoming rendition of Swan Lake. The production of Swan Lake requires the queen to play the innocent White Swan and the provocative Black Swan.  Primarily, the film focuses on Portman's conservative character, who must under pressure, contrastingly channel her inner malevolence to \"perfectly\" perform her role.  Portman IS the highlight of this film. Like with Mickey Rourke in The Wrestler,  Portman defines herself as an actress in this film. Although it takes an excessive amount of time to buildup to Nina's breakdown, the final half of Portman's performance is flawless. The spectrum of emotion and insanity she displays is so real, she has truly locked the \"best actress\" category for the upcoming award season.",

      "text": "If 'Black Swan' was directed by David Fincher, it would be called 'Ballet Club,' and it would be a thematic sequel to 'Fight Club.' However, it wasn't directed by Fincher, but instead by Darren Aronofsky, which explains why it is probably the most well-directed movie of the year. I can't say that it is the best film of the year, which I believe is 'The Social Network' because it is both good and culturally relevant, but Aronofsky's skill is at its peak in 'Black Swan,' and it sure is something to marvel. I believe Aronofsky exquisitely directed the most perfectly structured and beautifully told story of any film I have seen this year. I still give major props to Fincher, as well as David O Russell ('The Fighter') and Christopher Nolan ('Inception'). Natalie Portman steals the screen for the majority of the film, brilliantly portraying the fragile ballerina Nina Sayers. After winging the role of the Swan Queen in the upcoming show of the popular Swan Lake dance, Nina struggles to move out of the shadow of her nutty, sheltering mother, while rejecting the sexual advances and dark nature of her extremely professional instructor, all the while preparing for a performance she wants to make perfect. Seeing 'Tron Legacy' and 'The Fighter' before this (I saw all three in one day) helped keep me up with this whole perfection fiasco, which is the entire theme of 'Black Swan.' The most brilliant thing about 'Black Swan' is that it actually adapts the story of 'Swan Lake' into Nina's story that we see in the film. Since I'm a guy, I know very little about 'Swan Lake,' but Aronofsky obviously wasn't targeting all females with this film, so he throws in a summary about halfway in. It is then that you should be able to pick up that everything Nina is going through is a literal translation of the 'Swan Lake' story. This is even easier to notice with the orchestra music that plays throughout the movie during scenes that would not normally have music playing in the background. Most guys won't find this information fascinating at all, but hey, we get to see two hot chicks making out. Or do we? Aronofsky does a lot more with this film than you'll probably be able to notice after seeing it once. This includes having Natalie Portman always wearing white while Mila Kunis always wears black, to represent Portman as the Swan and Kunis as the dark side, although this symbolism is all in Nina's head. Her reluctance to push everyone else out of her life shows as we continually see her trying to keep her mother out of her room, as well as her attempts to impress her instructor while failing to understand what he wants out of her. Her struggle to impress two perfectionists drives her to the point of insanity, and the balance of the two characters on Nina's shoulders represents the struggle of the \"swan\" with it's dark side, which we see leads to a surprisingly extravagant conclusion. I would say that Aronofsky was very Fincher-esque with the psychological mindf**k, Kubrickian with the perfectionist structure of the film (especially with the bombastically loud orchestral soundtrack), or even Tarantinoish with the way he incorporated symbolism every which way (as 'Inglourious Basterds' did), but if you have seen any of this director's past films, you will understand that this is all Aronofsky. While it is indeed perfect, and very symbolic, it is also very dark and never afraid to push the limits, just as his other films are. 'Black Swan' as a whole represents the beauty of Aronofsky's dark natured filmography, although some will not like it since the limits the film pursues to push are not the type fans of Disney's 'Ice Princess' would've expected. It actually thrilled me to see many of the young girls in the theater covering their eyes throughout the film, just so I could assure myself that I wasn't watching some Hannah Montana manure.",

      "text": "Black Swan makes Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 look like best picture of the year--I say this because I thought the Potter movie just might be the worst movie of 2010.  To my surprise, and dismay, that is not the case.  There's an even worse film:  Black Swan.  It takes itself so seriously--We're making Art here, people!--that I wished I was watching ballet and not this movie.  I hate ballet and this movie made me want to watch ballet.  That's how bad this movie is.  Watching ballet would have been more entertaining, more fun, and for more original than this insipid meat cleaver to the face--thirty seconds into the movie and it's clear that Natalie Portman's character is madder than a hatter and there the guesswork ends; the conspicuous meat cleaver has split your face in two, but does director Aronofsky stop there?  Nope.  His disgust for subtlety (of any kind) knows no bounds, or shame.  He wants us to be so sure that Portman is madder than a hatter that he meat cleavers us in the face over and over:  She's madder than a hatter!  It's all in her head!  Get it?  Yes, Darren Aronofsky, I got it thirty seconds into the movie when the first meat cleaver got me square between the eyes, thank you very much.  This movie is so bloody obvious that I began to wonder if Aronofsky simply doesn't want his audience to use their brains while watching one of his art house movies.  (We're making Art here, people, and curing cancer!)  Is he so threatened by someone else's interpretation that he leaves no possible room for interpretation?  Is that the reason for the meat cleavers to the face, Darren?  If true, I'd argue Aronofsky's got some issues that he might want to take up with his urologist.  There isn't an original moment in this predictable, so-called disturbing movie.  Disturbing?  It's disturbing that Black Swan was so bad it made me want to watch ballet!  To make matters worse, (if that's possible, and dear God in heaven, it is), there isn't a likeable character in the entire film.  Now, there's nothing in filmmaking 101 that says you have to have a likeable character in your movie, but basic storytelling will tell you that if you want your audience to connect in a way that matters, a likeable character might be a good idea.  In the very least, have an unlikable character find some kind of redemption at the end so that the audience will feel emotionally satisfied.  In Black Swan, every character is not only an obvious stereotype, they're repugnant.  (When Barbara Hershey came in as the evil ballet stage mother, I thought I was watching bad satire.)  I was like, well, geez, I can't stand these people, I have no hope for them, it's clear there is no hope for them because they're all crazy, so why do I care what happens to them at the end?  It isn't my fault that I felt this way.  It's Darren Aronofsky's fault.  When the end did finally come (thank God), was I surprised, shocked, horrified, confused, sad?  No!  I just wanted to get out of the theatre and see some ballet!  And this brings me to Natalie Portman's brave acting job:  Brave because she lets a hot chick go down on her and shows us her orgasm face.  Wow, that takes some talent.  (Porno stars do it all the time, but they're professionals so they make it look easy.)  Halle Berry did the same thing for Monster's Ball, and she did it better, longer and with Billy Bob Thorton--now that's what I call brave!--and at least Halle showed some boob.  All we get in Black Swan is Portman's worried orgasm face.  Of course, she'll be nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress (because she was so brave--We're making Art here, people, curing cancer and bringing peace to the world!)  The Academy did the same thing to Halle, but Hollywood has a tradition of rewarding actresses who show us their orgasm faces in movies.  Put a famous actress in a movie where a guy or girl goes down on her and she shows us her orgasm face and you can be sure she'll receive a nomination.  Most of the time, they don't do that for the men.  (Sean Penn got an Academy Award for MILK, but he didn't show us his orgasm face or go down on a guy in the movie, so it doesn't count.)  It's usually just the ladies.  Hollywood's orgasm face double-standard, like this typical Hollywood movie:  A steaming pile of hubristic crap.",

It took about five minutes to dissolve. The rest of the time watching this film was utterly painful and a complete waste of time. An idiotic plot without drama (in spite of the gory blood and explicit sex), stereotypical characters, wooden acting and ridiculous attempts at making Natalie Portman look like a dancer. She does, when standing still, having achieved the required amaciated look but nothing more. Her very beautiful face is in every scene - but after a while even the most gorgeous looks become tedious, especially if it only has the one static expression of a stunned rabbit cought in the spotlight.",

Such images play upon the morbid fascination that one feels when considering the loss of something that one considers to be essential to one's being, like a leg, or one's flesh, or one's face, or one's eyes.  Not even one of the characters is truly nurturing of either art or of the human beings who make it.  Even the mother of the lead character is revealed to be a falsely nurturing figure.  If that were true in real life, then there would be no art at all.  The movie left me with a feeling of dread that took several hours to overcome.",

Ill give credit where its due, Natalie Portman gives so much of herself that you wonder what depths she went too to portray this tortured soul...She is absolutely spellbinding. The Director 'Darren Aronofsky' however holds the reigns as best he can, but with such a bleak pallet and morbid tone, his raw technique, digs deeper than it needs and seems lost in its own pretensions. The Final 20 minutes however are breathtaking, with all the forgotten loose ends brought together in a truly operatic finale. To be fair maybe it needs another viewing to fully appreciate its complexities, but the thing is, \" I don't  want to watch it again\"!!",

It confirms what you'd already anticipated and resolves whatever mild curiosity you might have had.  The acting is good.  Mila Kunis is terrific.  The relationship between Natalie Portman's character and her domineering, self-loathing mother is completely credible, and Portman is effective in playing an obsessive, egocentric, immature artist.

But I do respect the athleticism and talent involved in the process.  The ballet in this movie is merely the context of the story, not the point.  This is also not about a rivalry between two ballerinas, which was written by another user.  That may be implied by the trailer but it is not what's going on; I bet that person did not see the movie.  This is about a woman who is losing her mind, imagining lots of things including a rivalry that is more about her limitations and flaws than anything else.  My only complaint about the movie is either about how Natalie Portman played Nina or how Nina was written or how Arronofsky wanted Nina  to come across.  I'm not quite sure which one.  The problem is that Nina is so sheltered and so scared and so naive and so timid and so repressed that her character doesn't ultimately make sense.  The time and effort that go into such a career are monumental, as is the amount of rejection and judgement to which these people are subject.  It simply is not realistic on any level that Nina could have gotten as far as she did in the world of ballet  while being on such a weak psychological precipice.  It makes the story easier to believe, Portman looks on the verge of tears many times in this movie.  But anyone who had gotten that far in such a difficult profession quite frankly would have more mettle.  But that person wouldn't psychologically crumble as easy as Nina.  Still it is interesting.  Is Nina's mom living vicariously through her daughter (because she had to give up her career) or is the mom so over-protective that she has kept her daughter in a state of perpetual childhood.  I suspect a little of both.  Is Lily a potential ally or is she the rival Nina perceives her to be?  Did Lily help Nina by giving her ecstasy or did that hasten Nina's downfall?  I had hoped that it would have been less clear what was real vs. imagined.  It sure seemed pretty obvious.",

With a thrilling and perplexed performance by Natalie Portman, and stylish directing from Darren Aronofsky, Black Swan can go far. The story is more complicated than you think it is. It is not just about a ballet dancer, it is about a ballet dancer with deep mental issues. Nina is professional ballet dancer who got promoted to play the key role in a ballet performance, the Swan Queen. With a lot of pressure on her, the story proposes that she is obviously hallucinating about her body being deform. At first, I thought all of this was real because Natalie Portman is so believable. But as the story developed, I know for a fact that this girl has some serious mental issues. A summary about the film really doesn't do it justice, go watch it and you'll see exactly what I'm talking about. Black Swan demonstrates how ballet is as exciting and thrilling as an action movie with Arnold Schwarzenegger in it. Natalie Portman might even win the Best Actress Oscar, that is if she beat Annette Bening (but she already locked herself an Oscar nod). Darren Aronofsky will probably snatch the Best Director nod, but Black Swan will definitely have a chance at the Best Picture run.",

The surrealism mixed with the psychological torment of competition gave this film a VERY realistic feel for any person once involved with competitive theatre or dancing. All the actors were terrific and Mila Kunis was not shadowed by Natalie Portman, she stood her ground as her black swan and was a terrific supporting actress. Do what you can to see this movie.

Both players pushed themselves physically and emotionally to lend gravitas to an art form that isn't widely respected or understood.  She brings such life to her roll.  She embodies anxiety, fear, excitement, frustration, and sexual confusion.  Every other character in the film represents some external source of emotion.  None of the supporting players gets three dimensions.  Each fills a role: \"the mother,\" \"the director,\" \"the rival,\" \"the former star.\"  To that end, each of those characters inspires a different sort of anxiety, curiosity, dread, or fury in the central character, and Natalie Portman brilliantly evokes the oftentimes subtle distinctions between those emotional responses.

Aronofsky has usually a deep insight and great, great imagery, but like in Requiem for a Dream the one-dimensional plot is a problem and it can be summarized in \"drugs are bad\". On the Wrestler, that's a perfect example of a good main character. In here, instead of creating two faces of a same character (depth!), he keeps playing with one dimension in two characters. Where's the moment that the actress mixes the two swans and get in control of that? Besides the 'actress-killing-rival-before-premier' is quite worn out already. I was expecting a true transformation, a true character, and all that was shown is a girl that cannot stop whining and an alter-ego that is a plain murderer. Everything else was stunning, and brought high art to the masses: the songs, the grace of the swans, the art environment, and a specifically good scene where the teacher, tryint to seduce her, shows her (and us) the true meaning of ballet. I just think it needed characters with more depth to add verisimilitude to it.",

      "text": "\"Black Swan\" is a terrifying and beautiful psych-thriller which completely blew me away. I almost felt genuinely sick while watching the movie, similar to the feeling I had while watching the downward spiral that was \"Requiem for a Dream;\" but I can't say that it wasn't amazing. \"Black Swan\" hits you at your emotional core, and Portman's performance in the film may very well be her best outing to date. The film follows Nina (Natalie Portman), the main character and recently selected lead in her studio's upcoming production of \"Swan Lake,\" through the weeks leading up to the debut of the play (which is re-instated in a more simple form to attempt to defibrillate the struggling company). As her instructor Thomas (Vincent Cassel) states, the role is very dynamic, and requires her to get \"loose\" to play the seductive and deceptive black swan. She struggles at first, but soon finds darkness in a life filled with innocence, and becomes ensnared in the role. The movie turns into a nightmarish and terrifying struggle between good and evil, as Nina battles amongst herself to try to come to grips with the ballet role that is consuming her life, and her soul. The film is edgy, raw, and at times, outright frightening. It has that visceral and striking presence which Aronofsky is so masterfully talented at projecting, although it is purposely flawed so that you are sick to your stomach with Nina's mental health. It makes heavy work of symbolism and irony, and repeating themes include duality, hatred, anger, control and insanity. Personally, I loved the film. It is almost impossible to not be hypnotized by the intense cinematography, the outstanding performances, and the bold imagery. The entrancing score by Clint Mansell, a long-time collaborator of Aronofsky's, is real and powerful, and perfectly captures the essence of the film's most intense moments. I guess the one thing which kept me from giving it a ten would be that the film almost does too much at times. It is complicated, and although brilliantly conceived, it draws away from an audience which may more greatly appreciate it for it's terrifying reality, and not its symbolism and depth. Regardless, the movie is greatness in a bottle. If you haven't seen it yet, treat yourself over the holidays; you won't regret it.",

      "text": "I really feel like Aronofsky has found a happy medium between Requiem for a Dream and The Wrestler with his latest masterpiece, Black Swan.  He definitely takes his interpretation of Swan Lake and All About Eve to some unique places with the film.  And he doesn't feel the need to have to make sense on a practical level, because he is using his chosen medium to express the torment Natalie Portman's character is going through as she prepares for the greatest role of her career.  And the film parallels both the stories of Swan Lake and All About Eve's storylines on a metaphorical level that is raw and provocative.  I have talked with many people who hated this film and our biggest degree of separation is the fact that I felt this film perfectly conveys what it is to put one's self out there on the stage, and what an actor (or dancer) must do to get to a certain place.  They felt that the film's unrealities derailed it from the point it was trying to make.  But I don't think a good filmmaker must be constricted by reality when trying to prove a point.  An artist must separate themselves from who they are and become what the character demands.  Portman's character didn't need to change to be the White Swan.  But to be the Black Swan, she had to abandon everything her mother wanted her to be.  Which brings me to the relationship between Portman and Barbara Hershey.  I personally know girls who have this EXACT relationship with their mothers.  I even know a girl who was named after Baryshnikov, who trained as a ballerina as a young girl, but ultimately gave up that dream and she has this exact relationship with HER mother.  So needless to say this relationship REALLY spoke to me.  The mother wants her daughter to remain innocent and perfect and be the ballerina in the box.  But she ultimately becomes the broken and chipped away figurine because that's what life does to us.  She has to rebel against her mother, her company, and even herself to find the darkness within that she needs to play this part.  And if people don't really believe this is what artists go through, they don't have to look as far back as Van Gogh severing his ear to remember the fates of Heath Ledger and River Phoenix.  Some artists who try and tap into the darkness wind up killing themselves in the same way Portman's character slips over the edge.  That's why I think this movie is so spectacular, and why Portman deserves the Oscar.  Her transformation was flawless.  And lovely to watch.  And Clint Mansell's hypnotic score ushered us along in perfect sync with Portman's descent.  For someone who has enjoyed ballets and operas and theatre in general, Aronfsky has given us a dour tour de force that should satisfy most pallets, whether they can handle the macabre elements or not.  I can't wait to see what he does with The Wolverine.  Haha.",

      "text": "The little girl in LEON: THE PROFESSIONAL (1994) had grown up now. Natalie Portman is at her peak performance so far. Team up with heavy-caliber Director Darren Aronofsky, they made a beautiful story but horrifying at the same time. Aronofsky is invincible, especially when he explored human desperation, like in his previous films REQUIEM OF A DREAM (2000), THE FOUNTAIN (2006) and THE WRESTLER (2008). For about 100 minutes of the movie, I felt like I was experiencing the theater performance, not just like a common movie. It filled with beautiful images and great orchestra. Nina (Portman) is a chosen ballerina to fulfil her dual roles all at once, to be irresistible innocence White Swan and also to become seductive evil Black Swan. Slowly but sure, the darker side of Black Swan absorbs her real life. I love the brilliant Cinematography. Aronofsky seemed to use two techniques of camera work. One was for The Long Shot, he used steady conventional method. And the second for The Close-up, he used Hand-held Camera. I had ever said that Hand-held Camera is modern technique in today cinematic world. Not only for Action, but recently for Drama as well, Hand-shake Camera is able to effectively drag you into the middle of ongoing situation, if you are not using Hand-held Camera, you are out of date now. The Cast is amazingly fit. Vincent Cassel is fit for provocative and ambitious Ballet Instructor. Mila Kunis is fit for seductive and ambitious Nina colleague. Barbara Hershey is fit for authoritarian and ambitious mother. And even a brief but impressive appearance by Winona Ryder as anxious and ambitious competitor. Yeah, it is all about ambition and you can see it in each character, all of them have their own ambition. However, the star of all stars above is Portman herself. She shows her darker side successfully, you could literally feel her pain, pressure and paranoia situation. The movie becomes more mysterious with some unusual sex scenes. For the last half hour of film duration, she drives us into beautiful but ironic condition, sometimes absurdity become the part of it. Those last scenes are extremely horrified, with broken fingernail, peeling skin and fractured bone for the elements. I almost could categorize thiz movie as a Horror movie. The movie emphasizes in every beautifulness of ballet, there is dark side that we never know before. Finally, I just want to say, It was perfect.",

      "text": "At the end of Rob Marshall's \"Chicago\", in an effort to clear up any lingering doubts from moviegoers about what they just saw, the titles proudly trumpet that the principal actors did all their own singing and dancing. So adept  were Richard Gere, Catherine Zeta-Jones, and Renee Zelwegger at both performing arts, some audience members may have presumed that professionals were called in to do all the heavy lifting, especially the dancing, where, as is the norm for any movie that requires multi-tasking(stunt work, stripping, etc...) of its actors, a double can be inserted whenever the camera catches the body without a head. Knowing this, the novelty aspect behind a Hollywood starlet, a veritable household name, casting vanity aside and trying to disappear into the role of a top-flight ballerina is dispelled, right off the bat, when the filmmaker establishes his subject's competence(or dare I say, mastery) in dramatic fashion. Dancing by herself, establishing shots of Natalie Portman in balletic repose, give way to a close-up of disembodied feet, whose legs, cut off somewhere above the knee, could belong to anybody, but are indeed Portman's, when a camera tilt, along with the dancer's contortions, reorientates the actress to her lowest extremities, right after those thought-to-be-anonymous feet go from horizontal to vertical(in other words, \"on point\"), and then in gilded motion, like a pro. It's a goosebump moment, believe me. It's really her, the stripper who wouldn't strip in Mike Nichols' \"Closer\"...doing THAT! With Portman's credibility issues out of the way, this neo-\"Repulsion\" story becomes the focal point, which wouldn't be the case if Nina Sayers, a woman-girl with mommy issues(and sexuality issues) who's losing it, was heavily subordinated by a Julliard-trained stand-in to do all the hard stuff. The camera doesn't lie, especially a hand-held one, a probing thing that gets in Nina's grille(on and off-the-job), and Portman's body, all sinewy muscle and bone, is the truth, and passes with flying colors. The unbridled passion and masochism and predilection for self-sacrifice that every hungry, up-and-coming dancer possesses is captured in unerring detail by Portman, who on a short-time basis, obviously, went through the same taxing process herself, because you can see, actually see, that she's thinking, as opposed to acting, like a dancer in the cut-throat world of New York City swan-making. When asked by her lecherous ballet director(Vincent Cassell) to embody the second swan with the same assuredness as its white doppleganger, the virginal Nina goes down a rabbit hole of repression and self-hatred when the unformed girl is forced to ruminate over sex, a subject she clearly deflects through overcompensation, in which ballet has proven to be a stunting mechanism for this grown woman(who still lives with her mom and has a room populated with a menagerie stuffed animals), thereby creating a vast disconnect between her emotional and chronological age. When you get right down to it, \"Black Swan\" is all about f*cking. In her room, Nina touches herself, and is made to feel guilty about having desire, all at once, upon discovery of her mother asleep in a bedside chair(or is she?), indicating a past history in which Erica(Barbara Hershey), a failed dancer who has mixed emotions about her daughter's success, impeded Nina's sexual development through calculated sheltering. Not wanting to draw comparisons with Michael Haneke's \"The Piano Teacher\", Nina and her mother sleep in separate rooms, but the disturbance created by Erica, her seeming entitlement to be in such close proximity to her adult daughter, suggests that the bedtime arrangements are still new. In a sense, the mother helped birth the black swan that haunts Nina. As a result of her psycho-sexuality, Nina stabs the dark bird, stabs Lily(Mila Kunis), for awakening her greatest fear, inflaming the fragile ballerina to stab herself, out of self-hatred for not being the white swan, mother's \"sweet girl\".",

Jung is referenced in the story of how a person must come to terms with his or her \"shadow\" which is often referred to as a doppleganger.  Even French Symbolist poetry with its fondness for the swan, which in French is the \"signe\"--the sign or symbol, comes into play.   If you are a person who really likes things intellectual like this, you will probably get a lot out of this film.    However, on an emotional level, the film never takes flight.  We really never connect to the character.  There is very little emotional variety in this film.  It's the same emotion throughout with just an increasing intensity.  It may be a \"tour de force\" but after a while it kind of gets monotonous.   When I saw the film, audience members laughed at a scene of a dead body being dragged.  (A ballerina dragging a dead body is funny!)  I have heard of other viewings with hoots and hollers at the sex scenes.  I think people just get bummed out at such \"very serious theater\" sort of business.  At the end of the film, the main character dies.  I have yet to hear of anyone shedding a tear for her.",

Mila Kunis, Vincent Cassel as the slimy Ballerina director and; surprise, Winona Ryder are also excellent.

This is why I have a feeling some critics didn't \"get it.\" Critics too often calculate and add up too much to recognize their own feelings about a movie, and frequently judge a movie based on its adherence to a particular formula, but this movie tosses away a formula and creates its own impressionistic view of a situation, much like Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream. There is an added bonus if you are an artist who has given themselves to a project and sacrificed something for it, because this movie shows you the extremes to which you can go for that feeling of having done your job to perfection. As an actor I sympathize mostly with Nina's desire to be perfect and to successfully fulfill her director's wishes, and I'm sure it would apply to so many other fields of creative art.",

We only hope there is some salvation at the end. Black Swan is created by one of the most passionate bright young filmmakers alive. The camera style is more regimented and thoughtfully composted compared to the cinema verite, looser, documentary style of The Wrestler. Every shot is perfectly thought out, and the use of mirrors in this film is simply magnificent. The monochromatic colour tone is stunning and at all times the colour palette of everything in shot is tempered to enhance the story. Especially in the wardrobe coloring. The Wrestler was based in the real world, the world we all live in, where a man is grappling with the failures in life, has a daughter, works part-time as a butcher, falls for a stripper and tries to resurrect his fledgling career. It deals with his ego and his determination. Its almost documentary in style. Black Swan is a film sprung from Darren Aronofsky's imagination, aided by a team of talented writers. It is a dark tale of ones inner struggle with perfection. In essence the film centers on the central character of Nina Sayers as she grapples with life as a star ballerina. She does all she can to find perfection within her self and with others. We go into the depths of her mind, and at times the film is as frightening as a Polanski film, at its best. Natalie Portman went on a rigorous training regime for this film and it shows, her performance is mature, dark and stunning. I can continue to write numerous pages on pledging my love for this film but I wont waste my time, or yours, as if you need further information on this, the web is abound with it.

Darren Aronofsky goes from making us sympathize with large sweaty men hitting each other with chairs to making pretty girls in tutus scary as hell, and he does it with style.  From the first frame to the final fade Swan is a breathless descent into madness which left me breathless at the end.  I went into the movie expecting it to be intense, but I was in no way prepared for what was in store and I will say I left the theatre very happy.  Very disturbed, but happy.  Portman is amazing as Nina pulling the audience down into madness with her, making a gradual transition which is captivating to watch (which is good because she gets the vast majority of the the screen time).  Mila Kunis is frightening as Lily, changing from breezy and friendly to dark and scary on a dime creating a terrifying antagonist for Nina while also serving to be a great foil as well.  However the one dark horse in the movie is Winona Ryder, who doesn't have very much screen time but makes every second count making the audience deathly afraid of her character while still feeling an overwhelming sense of pity as well.  Aronofsky's direction is certainly felt, but it never gets in the way, deftly moving from scene to scene and gradually increasing the tension like a master.  The visuals of the film are nothing short of beautiful, even with the purposefully dark and grainy filming.  In my opinion it is one of the best of the year,  the best thing both Portman, Kunis and Aronofsky have done as well.  However the dark tone and graphic nature of the film is definitely not for everyone.",

Darren Aronofsky paints a surprisingly chilling picture with a vibrant palette.

This movie takes the story of dual personalities to a whole new level of unknown, which is beautifully portrayed by Natalie Portman, taking her to a spot where the Oscar doesn't look like just a dream anymore. It's a touching story, based around a small group of characters, and that's a place where Aronofsky is at his best (i.e. Requiem for a dream). Also, it would be unfair to forget Vincent Cassel, who showed himself in a totally different manner creating a strong, patriarchal character.

But, you know, with reading and writing. Having said that, let me say this about Black Swan Here's my review... -------------- Black Swan. \"The gripping tale of a schizophrenic's quest for the ultimate orgasm.\" I just don't know how else to tagline this movie. Portman is transcendent in this deeply psychological role. I don't see her losing the Best Actress Oscar. And Mila Kunis holds her own -- and some of Portman's -- in a deftly turned supporting performance. The music is beautiful, as would be expected, and the film gives you a greater respect for ballerinas as expert craftswomen. At least, it did for me. The story itself seems more a lattice upon which the performances flourish like ivy, as opposed to the characters driving a strong, riveting story. This may be a disappointment to some who desire a more traditional three-act story with a clear resolution. And one last thought. Kudos to Winona Rider for her particularly dark, near-cameo turn as a past-her-prime prima ballerina. Quite riveting.

It is simply the best film I've ever seen. Number one Natalie Portman was phenominal in her role as Nina. It was a very hard role, and she had it doen to a T.  She totally desereved her Oscar. The real star though is Darren Aronofsky. His direction in this film was absolutley breathtaking. He is one of the best filmmakers left in Hollywood. His movies are always good, if not great. The way he directed this film was a spooky and creepy. The way the classical music was used in this film was absolutley genius. The cinematography in every scene was excellent. It created the tension for the film and never let you go until the last moment. The use of black and white as symbolism was also a very good mood and the love scene between Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis was beautiful. It wasn't gratuitous or exploitative. It was forced or thrown in. It went with the movie.  The film creeped me out, it had at the edge of my seat and at that final moment, it had me tearing up. Why didn't this movie win any more Oscars? It was absolutley perfect. This film stayed with me even after I watched it and I have a feeling that it will stay with me for a long time.",

All that being said, as a movie, it's just pretty good.  It simply wasn't entertaining enough, and there were too many scenes that didn't seem to have much of a point.  Worst of all, I didn't feel much of a connection with any of the characters (as good as Portman was).  I've heard some people compare this to the Wrestler (which seems pretty fair).  The difference between those two though is that Mickey Rourke's character seemed so much more human than Portman's character.  It's pretty hard to really like Portman's character in this, considering she's a borderline pyscho.  Decent movie, overhyped, probably won't see it again, but don't regret seeing it.  Certainly gets points for originality.",

It's multiple layers of reality, heady themes and dark, surreal imagery may put some viewers off. If you enjoy challenging, original filmmaking that works on multiple levels, then Black Swan could be the ideal film for you. There is no weak link in the casting. Natalie Portman quite rightly won the Academy Award for Best Actress, and her powerful and intricately complex performance as the massively paranoid ballet dancer Nina Sayers will remain with you long after the end credits roll. Mila Kunis, Vincent Cassel and Barbara Hershey all leave their own marks on the film as Nina's rebellious but talented rival Lily, her womanising director Thomas and her over-protective, domineering mother respectively. Also worth a mention is Winona Ryder playing Beth MacIntyre, a huge ballet star forced into early retirement and replaced by Nina - it's a relatively small but crucial role, and Ryder's best performance in years. The film looks fantastic, with Matthew Libatique's cinematography and Andrew Weisblum's editing evolving with the mood of the film - as story becomes more fractured and erratic, the camera movements become less smooth, the editing choppier and more jarring. The style of the whole film is designed to create a steadily increasing sense of unease, so as Nina steadily loses her grip on reality, so do we as viewers. We don't quite know what is as isn't real from about halfway through the film, so much of it is open to interpretation. My only gripe is in the final act where Nina appears to physically transform into a swan with the assistance of expensive-looking CGI. I almost wish Aronofsky saved his money here, as the simpler visuals he employs are far more effective (Portman's reflection moving of its own accord is a far creepier way to represent Nina's fractured identity as a result of her obsession with the black swan role than her physically sprouting feathers). Despite this minor annoyance, Black Swan remains an extremely powerful, intelligent and thought-provoking film that you'll be hard-pressed to forget.",

He is a true visionary. The second is the performance by the lead, Natalie Portman, which, needless to say, is a revelation.

After the former prime dancer Beth Macintyre(Winona Ryder) is forced to retire by Leroy,Nina successfully is cast as Odette,the swan queen.But a mysterious new dancer Lily(Mila Kunis)becomes her most dangerous rival.Darren Aronovsky is a master. One of the greatest director out there.His direction is visionary and everything but ordinary.The pace of the film is really engaging and the script has truly original aspects.The movie has really absorbing moments as the transformation of Nina in the Black swan and her desperation that it is difficult to not be drawn.The depiction of her obsession for the perfection and increasing mental disorder is quite fascinating.The soundtrack is outstanding although it's not original but it's taken from the musical.But it adds to the general beauty of the film and express the characters feeling and the roles they have in the story. Natalie Portman,in her first adult role,excels as the leading character.This is her most complex role and she is exceptional and her first great turn after Closer.Her Oscar Award was completely deserved. Mila Kunis is adequate to the role,but honestly I didn't catch all the praises she gained for her performance.Her role is the easiest and she is an average actress. Vincent Cassel plays \"extremely\" well the same character(that is inspired by his own personality)in every movie.That's all.And not too much I have to say. Barbara Hershey is truly a gem and she deserved more recognition for her complex role ,she is never over the top although her role could have been played with exaggeration.She is a really great actress.She should have been nominated for an Oscar. Winona Ryder,in her brief role as the fallen prime dancer,was a scene stealer.In only three scenes she is haunting,damned, desperate,intoxicated and angry and was truly mesmerizing.My vote is 10/10",

Throughout, we follow the clearly disturbed Nina, played by Natalie Portman, who absolutely kills it here.

Mila Kunis and Vincent Cassel also have good supporting roles here.

'black swan' talks about what to sacrifice a performer to embody a role. Leave out the downside because the script demands it can be a way to open a Pandora's box that was better than remain under lock and key. Using all the resources of traditional horror, such as sound scares, sudden apparitions or visions, confusions  Aronofsky creates numerous situations of fear, coupled with the interpretation and dramatic context of the rest of the film, may seem out of tune. The film is borderline, and with a tap to the side, lose balance and be grotesque or ridiculous. But the movie has its own elegance in its production design, but the music reminds me a little of the music of Harry Potter, not me, I just rang me. Of course not all the music, just a song, because as the same sound with Potter, it may not be true, but that I think. We are facing a psychological horror film, a genre that I like a lot but here sule used that concept very well, the large team of writers has done an excellent job of being able, not only to portray the madness and spreading despair, but also to exploit the full potential, but without going over, though, as I say, they were close to the line.",

It's a dark, thrilling, disturbing, and even terrifying movie that succeeds primarily because of Natalie Portman's fantastic performance in both acting and dancing. Black Swan begins as a simple drama about a ballet dancer that just wants to succeed and get the leading role in Swan Lake before taking a very dark turn into a disturbing horror film about how this ballerina completely loses touch with reality and delves into a living nightmare. Black Swan is grotesque, beautiful, and dramatic all at the same time.",

I am not a huge fan of animated movies, but this one is very intriguing! More interestingly, it resembled Black Swan quite a lot for me, but it was from the 1990s. Then I watched Black Swan again and, oh my god, it is such a close adaption (not to say a rip off with one mask or two).  However, the way the conflict wraps up in the animated movie is a thousand times more twisted and the main character is so much more profound, that I desired that Black Swan was just a self-aware live action adaption of Perfect Blue. I do like the ballet better than the background context used in Perfect Blue though.",
