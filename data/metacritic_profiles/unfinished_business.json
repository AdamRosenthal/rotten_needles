There are many funny moments though, but what I didn't like was that some of the characters were just quite bland in my opinion, and Vince Vaugh himself, maybe better than in other movies I have seen with him, still wasn't that funny.  You shouldn't expect much from it, but it is still a fun watch and if you are bored it's not your worst option to see",
