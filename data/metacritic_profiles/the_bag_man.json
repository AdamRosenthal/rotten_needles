During a secret meeting, a mob boss gives his hit man a seemingly easy job. Pick up a bag, go to a motel in the middle of nowhere, and wait there until the boss comes to pick it up. The hit man does as he's told and gets a room at this motel, which is not only in the middle of nowhere, but is also filled with a group of ridiculously strange people, who all want this mysterious bag. John Cusack stars and no matter the role or the film, he's always fun to watch. There is just something about him that always makes his films entertaining and it's a good thing, especially in a film like this. While Cusack is along for the ride, it is very hard to follow along and like what you're seeing, because the film is just so bizarre. The cast of characters coming for this secret bag, include a pimp, a Russian midget, a corrupt sheriff, and a very weird guy in a wheelchair just to name a few. As the night wears on it becomes harder and harder to protect this bag, and in the end, when the bag is finally opened, you'll realize, that you just wasted 90 minutes for that!? I admire anything John Cusack does, De Niro is always terrific as a gangster, and if nothing else, The Bag Man is unique, but not for it's story.

Despite, in some scenes it is dull, but it needs to be dull, it alerts you that something big will happen at the end, and when it does, it is satisfying. Although the movie is in some parts predictable, but for the most part, it works out as a mystery that isn't gonna solve it self, thus at some parts you have to connect the dots.

Loved seeing Jon Cusack as the \u201cBag Man\u201d, reminded me of when he did Gross Point Blank, but more of a serious take on the part. Why doesn\u2019t he play tough guys more often I wonder? He was really convincing in this part and it was a nice change from the kind of light comedy roles he always seems to play.",

Reminded me of the briefcase in Pulp Fiction and the whole movie had kind of a pseudo-Tarantino feel to it with all the oddball characters in the motel and De Niro as an intellectual gangster. John Cusack was pretty good, as usual. Bit of a strange part for him as I\u2019m used to seeing him in comedies but he was pretty convincing as a tough guy. Maybe not a masterpiece, but it was entertaining and I was never bored.",

      "text": "Not a bad first time effort from writer/director David Grovic, especially considering this was his first major motion picture. I really dug the neo-Film Noir vibe although the movie was so dark sometimes it was kind of hard to see what was going on in some scenes. De Niro was enjoyable as the crime boss, although it didn\u2019t really seem like he stretched himself too much. Interesting casting with John Cusack as \u201cThe Bag Man.\u201d I like seeing him step out of his usual light comic roles and playing it more straight. Perfect Crispin Glover role as the quirky desk clerk. He\u2019s such an interesting actor, it\u2019s too bad there aren\u2019t more good parts for him. Rebecca De Costa was stunning obviously but also a good actress. I definitely expect to see her in more big roles this year. All in all, The Bag Man was a good time and a fun ride!",

The plot surrounding the mysterious \u201cbag\u201d John Cusack has to look after was filled with tension. I liked the simple idea of him hiding out in a cheap motel filled with interesting characters. Also lots of great action and a smoking hot femme fatale! All in all, the Bag Man had everything I look for in a crime thriller, tension, action, strong characters, and a sexy chic. I\u2019d recommend this movie.",

DeNiro and Cusack should have been a sure thing, but wasted in this film IMO. Lackluster dialogue and the fact that the actresses face never moved were the final blow for me.  It was one of those movies where I wouldn't be surprised to find out that she was spoon fed lines because they were all delivered in the same flat tone, ugh...don't waste your time",
