      "text": "In a time of bloodshed and war, Brothers attempts to become an instrumental film conveying the psychological effects of individuals in battle.  In order to do so, director Jim Sheriden employs drama within the film, but unfortunately falls flat until the conclusion occurs. This remake of the critically acclaimed 2004 Danish film, Brodre, is a story of two opposite brothers, Tommy Cahill (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Sam Cahill (Tobey Maguire).  Sam is a marine that is about to embark to Afghanistan leaving his two daughters and his wife Grace (Natalie Portman); While Tommy is on parole adjusting to his former life. When Sam is pronounced dead after a plane crash, Tommy attempts to relieve his brother's grieving wife and care for his two children.  When Sam is rescued from Afghanistan, he comes home truly affected by the war mentally. Confused, he is under the assumption that his brother and wife had a sexual relationship.  This causes bitterness within the family and ultimately showing how this war hero loses his inner self.",

The performances are sensational, ALL, from the little girls that gave relief to the melancholy mood of the film, going by his father, stepmother, who took good care of their roles while supporting and especially the trio who gave a show of emotion Natalie Portman Jake Gyllenhaal and Tobey Maguire.",

From one angle it's a well acted family drama about a man coming home from war, but from another angle is a confused film with a story that's completely unfocused, it doesn't know which character it wants to highlight. This confusion makes the story lack the depth that the subject material required. I thought some elements of the story-line were forced without any cause or purpose.",

      "text": "Brothers is an emotionally stirring film that really packs a punch when it comes to its examination of PTSD and war. Certainly not pro-military, Brothers thankfully does not go rah rah when it comes to America, instead showcasing how everyone is not necessarily a hero, because you never know what they went through. Even if you think they are, they may vehemently disagree. It's all relative. As someone who is very skeptical when it comes to the military, I greatly appreciated this element. That said, I am not sure I am buying Tobey Maguire as a tough as nails major with his whiny voice. Fortunately, Jake Gyllenhaal and Natalie Portman are good enough to overcome that miscasting and really do fit their roles, but the writing is never quite satisfying. Though the story is well told, the film feels too short and the characters not nearly well fleshed out enough, with very little in the way of character development. Gyllenhaal's character completes a 180 without reason and very little explanation as to how, which is problematic. That said, the film's power and sharp acting performances from Gyllenhaal and Portman elevate Brothers into a more than satisfactory look at the darkside of war.",
