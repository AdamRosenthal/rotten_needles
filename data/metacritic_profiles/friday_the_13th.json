He has a disfigured head, wears a sack on his head till he gets a hockey mask, and he carries a machete. In the remake, he looks just like that. \"The other characters are stupid and are meant to die.\" Guys, did you even watch the other movies...in fact, have you seen any slasher movies? Every character in the Friday the 13th movies are all disposable for Jason to kill, except the main character. This takes place in Crystal Lake, just like the original movies. Jason takes his time killing people, just like the original movies. Most importantly, Jason didn't die. Do I have to mention about the original movies again?

All they have him do is just walk up behind the victims get their attention and kill them in some bloody way. It's far from tense or scary and that's what's so disappointing with this movie.

They did a solid enough job mixing the plots of the first 3 original films together into this one and the kills are certainly entertaining. Could have been acted better and would have been nice to see something different with the plot too. Not a terrible movie though.",

      "text": "First off, I love horror movies! I grew up watching old classics movies from the 70s-90s like Halloween, Child's Play, Friday the 13th, It, A Nightmare on Elm Street, etc. So when \"Friday the 13th\" remake came out, I think most people like me were excited, yet very skeptical. Basically, I pitied it with a score of 4, because it was nice to see Jason in action again, though, movie did turn out to be horrid. The kills were all so predictable, and not very creative. There was no character to really cheer on to survive or that you'd absolutely love. The acting was just somewhat off. There really wasn't much of a campy feel to it either. Plus, since it is a remake, this movie didn't really emphasize on Jason Voorhees and his mother's story. Like how it all began, or the new kids being skeptical staying in the cabin because of the stories being told about Crystal Lake and such. That used to be done in every Friday the 13th movie (and that scenes of when the characters would feel like they're being watched), and there's no reason why it shouldn't have been done it this one (especially for a new audience). They could have at least brought back an original actress/actor to appear in this remake. A big disappointment was the fact that Jason held that girl captive. He CHAINED HER UP instead of killing her. Okay yeah, she supposedly looked like his mother, but even the Jason in the original saw past that REAL quick. Also, this movie was not dark, scary, campy, nor suspenseful. And, the acting was a bit lacking. Honestly, it didn't even make me jump like the originals still do (no matter how many times I watch it lol). I agree with users JeffL about the absence of the memorable \"ch-ch-ch\" sound effects and MikeP about the movie being \"uninspired and pointless\". It is a damn shame that Directors and Writers are just making so many remakes and just ruining what we grew up with and that we have so many expectations of. And, the remake of Halloween was just the absolute worst! I could rant all day about that one lol.",

      "text": "The film opens with the death of Mrs. Voorhees and proceeds to the present day. It seems that the filmmakers re-wrote the film completely different. Whitney Miller (Amanda Righetti) is camping in the woods with her friends. After telling the legend of Jason Voorhees (Derek Mears) Jason actually kills Whitney's friends and takes her hostage underground. When we see Jason for most parts until the middle of the film he wears a sack over his head. It likes like the sack he wore in Friday The 13TH part: II. It's not until after killing someone in a barn does he get his Hockey Mask. This leaves me to believe that this is a film that combines the elements of the second and third films, totally re-written for a remake. While Whitney's brother Clay Miller (Jared Padalecki) searchers for her, Trent, (Travis Van Winkle) along with his friends and his girlfriend party it up at his mansion sized cottage. To me, this took away the Camp Crystal Lake setting. We're not even focused on it except for two scenes. One in the beginning and one in the middle. One includes Clay and Jenna hiding from Jason as he approaches with a body bag in Camp Crystal Lake. The first scene is when two of Whitney's friends  are go to visit Camp Crystal Lake in the beginning of the film. The battle between Clay and Trent really didn't help the storyline at all. The interesting part is that Jason won't kill Whitney because she has the locket his mom had in the opening sequence of the film. She reminds him of his mother. This film has a high gore content. An example is that in one water skiing scene involving Willa Ford and one of her cast members. After Willa falls into the wall her cast member is shot in the head by Jason with an axe. He falls down and is dead of course.  Another example is that Willa Ford is stabbed in the head by Jason with his Machete while hiding under a dock.",

I expected that the remake was awful and i was right. When the movie started  We have druggie  teenagers and the sluts as well, go camping at \" Camp Crystal lake.\" girls take off their shirts and then sex happens! did you think when watching this remake did you think there was going to be no sex? your wrong and there is sex a lot. (That's not the point), Then they wonder off  into oblivion then they  find Jason! the characters into the original were dumb in this \"remake\" they get Dumber. The story continues, a bunch of teens (what ever they are) are spending a week at a mansion.By the way these characters are much much worst as we saw earlier in the film, The guys get dumbest and so are the blonde whores as well. Thank god their was two good characters in this movie Jared Padalecki and his sister are kick ass one good thing about this movie. Positives:  Jason's  kills in this movie are totally epic.the action improves one-hundred percent;Jared Padalecki's performance as clay was epic and one of the best characters. This movie wants you to care about the characters, i didn't i just wanted them to be dead! thank god! the only character i cared was clay and his sister. Negatives: Nipsel directs other people's classic and turns into remakes, basically Nipsel just makes the directors of the original look bad. Cunningham gets a healthy way to kill the characters, Nipsel goes for the slick by pouring tomato crap as \"blood\". Nipsel  has no showing skill as a director. the script and the directing kills the franchise also Bay's presence. Producer Micheal Bay  ruins another successful franchise  also he has bad taste of directors instead of hiring a man who knows the genre/franchise, like James Wan or Hitchcock but no they choose the director who killed the chainsaw franchise  now kills the guy the mask franchise. You could hear mislead producers Andrew form and Brad Fuller screaming \"Come on Nipsel work that camera!\" and then cheap porn producer (Bay) saying \"hey speed it up let's shoot the sex scene i got my camera!\"  Bay just has to be involved in casting cute blondes to suck at acting in a movie then put them in a horror movie. It has \"Platinum Dunes\" written all over this movie. The writer Damian Shannon wrote ( Freddy vs Jason) he killed two franchises. Then we have  producer Sean S. Cunningham (the director of the original) the poor man! i can't believe that this guy is producing this garbage. Grade F+",
