The 1975 directed live action adaptation was nothing short of a disaster and now this over rated animated version also fails to sell the fables charms. In fact, it is the framing device about the little girl being introduced to the tale of \u2018The little Prince\u2019 that holds what interest there is to be had. The actual story of the title character, whilst aimed at children, is actually too adult orientated to be totally understood by its intended audience. On the plus side the animation is very good and Han Zimmer\u2019s music compliments the tone of the film perfectly. There are also a clutch of good songs on the soundtrack, some old and some new, including a couple of ballads which are really quite beautiful.",

However, with what little bits I saw in this film that I do remember from the book, it's all very imaginatively brought to life! Much of the animation was hand-drawn and it was certainly a visual and artistic treat to behold!

Lastly and most importantly, the film carried a heartwarming and universal message and theme that hit really close to home with me that touched my heart and had my eyes watering towards the end. Overall, this is an absolute must-see for everyone who has Netflix, as it's sadly only a Netflix original but truly deserves to be seen much wider!

The film has a memorable and all-star voice cast, and wonderful eye candy animation. A classic interpretation of a classic children's book. A must see and enjoyable film for both adults and children alike!",

Yet, how the story is told makes it so appropriate and respectful to discuss with all ages. This film being produced not only restores my faith in filmmaking, but in humanity itself. There are few films that so elegantly and subtly evoke emotions as this one does. Plus the animation is something truly to behold, backed by an incredible soundtrack to boot.",

It's also a little too literal and even a bit cringy at times. It still has nice animation and voice acting, though, as well as a good enough story. The ending is great, too.",
