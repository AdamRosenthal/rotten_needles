Many people were saying that Sex Tape could be the next Hangover, as it is an original idea with an all-star cast, but sadly it falls well short of expectations. Annie & Jay's marriage has become a little stale, so one night they decide to spice things up by making a Sex Tape. Jay is a music producers and inexplicably neglects the fact that his laptop is connected to many other devices, and the tape finds its way to the cloud. Once again, Jason Segel and Cameron Diaz have absolutely no chemistry. They are too different types of actors that just don't compliment each other and they are even less believable as a married couple. If that were the only issue with this film, maybe I could have gotten passed it, but the real problem, as with Bad Teacher, is that the writers don't know their audience. This is an R rated film about a sex tape and in no way meant for children, yet the jokes are on a sixth grade level. As an adult going to see a raunchy comedy, I'm not interested in jokes about erections and diarrhea, it's in very poor taste and isn't something many adults will respond to. This film is supposed to be a laugh out loud comedy, but there was barely even a snicker in the movie theater, which basically tells you all you need to know about this film. Sex Tape is trying to get people to see it under the guise of being raunchy and featuring some pretty attractive stars, that fans hope they will get to see naked. The truth is that it is very amateurish, you really don't see all that much, and the jokes could be out of PG movie. All in all, Sex Tape is a big disappointment and a huge waste of time.",

      "text": "Sex Tape is essentially a 90-minute Apple commercial. A promising premise is wasted on a slow-paced, unrealistic and disjointed storyline. The comedy bounces all over the place, unsure of how racy it should be, which in turn wastes the great cast. What ends up on the screen is a family farce film filled with corny, forced humour. This film is should only be watched if you're a fan of Cameron Diaz or Jason Segel, because if you're looking for any story or intelligent jokes you wont find it here.",

      "text": "All the other reviews I've read on this site about this movie I do think are very fair. As a 22 year old I honestly think Sex Tape did a pretty good job of being both entertaining and funny and if I'm honest i prefer it over Bad Teacher. The story isn't great but in my opinion that is not what you watch a comedy for. As a comedy Sex Tape does a great job of getting laughs out of what can be considered a very awkward and embarrassing situation. I love the crude humor and the gags on how aging people are loosing their touch with technology. All in all it is a great 'balls out' comedy which will keep most young entertained the whole way through.",

The characters are so stupid and the writing is the most lazy writing that I have seen in my life. I laughed once during this movie and that's it, sex tape is the most lazy comedy that I seen this year and I tried to find something good in this movie but I couldn't.",
