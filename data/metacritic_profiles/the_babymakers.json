This film had two main problems.  First, although a zany plot can sometimes work in a comedy, when it doesn't, it becomes annoying.  That was the case here.  The wanna-be plot twists weren't funny or interesting or in any way believable.  There were some missed opportunities.  Second, while comedies generally don't require Oscar-worthy performances, these actors, with few exceptions, seemed to completely mail it in.  They probably knew the movie was going nowhere, but that doesn't excuse what comes across as a lack of effort in what they have been paid to do .  Let me be a little more specific: there was no chemistry to be found in almost all the interactions between the film's characters.  For instance, the lead husband and wife, supposedly married for three years, acted as if they were on their second or third date or worse, like distant cousins re-connecting after years apart.  They never seemed like they would be married in real life.  The buddies-hanging-out-at-a-bar seemed like they had nothing in common and would not hang out or trust one one another.  The list goes on.",
