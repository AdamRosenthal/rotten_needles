Let me cut to the chase, Home is terrific. Home's plot is extremely simple, simple for a kids film, that's how simple it is, but Home is full of thrilling moments that always deliver. The film is hilarious, and I feel that absolutely everyone who goes to see it will be chuckling at some point, it uses many different styles of humour, all of which will have you laughing. The all-star cast make the voice acting fantastic and believable. But the best part of Home, is the terrific emotional weight it carries, it not just about laughs, it's about friendship, it's about morals, it's how you see the world, and how the world sees you, it's powerful. It delivers several different kinds of emotions and feelings throughout the film, it will give you warm feelings, sad feelings, happy feelings, thrilling feelings, you'll be laughing, you'll be enjoying the thrill, there's never a dull moment. It's for this powerful display of emotion that Home is the best film I've seen this year, it managed to shock me and thrill me in ways that no other animated film has before. For every reason I've said above, it'll be getting a perfect score, for the emotion, for the laughs, and for the absolutely perfect, flawless climax, which is better than some big budget films I've seen.

The movie had a rushed storyline where parts of the movie were not explained enough in full during the first half of the movie to understand how the concepts of the movie worked. Also, the fact that 80% of the film's soundtrack consisted of Rihanna songs both kills the belief that the sound crew had a taste for creativity during the film, and also makes me believe that the producers cut a deal with Rihanna to put several songs performed by her in the film to save money on production costs. (In other words, a \"2-for-1\" special.) And, to add more mention of \"Rihanna advertising\" to the film, the character she voices just happens to be from the same country as her; since no characters in the film have singing parts, this film, at a certain point, started to feel like an advertisement for a Rihanna album.",

It is also more palatable than many of the recent crop of animated films in that it doesn't get too mushy and soft centred at its conclusion. The story is sound and the score, including some impressive songs, is also an asset. Overall, surprisingly good!",
