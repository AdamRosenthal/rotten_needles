      "text": "Another best selling teen fantasy novel hits the big screen and thanks to Tim Burton, it's a big success albeit a little strange. The story centers around a boy named Jake (Asa Butterfield), whose grandfather always told him these strange stories. The whole family thought he was a little off and no one put much stock in them, until one day his grandfather is attacked, and Jake sees things that he can't explain. Jake decides the only way to get the answers he seeks is to find out if the stories of Miss Peregrine and her school are real, so with his father's assistance, he travels to Wales to find them, and begins the adventure of a lifetime. Even without Tim Burton's unique twist and strange characters this story is extremely original and more than carries it's weight, but the visual elements certainly help, especially when it comes to bringing in the young audiences. As for the stars, Eva Green is your typical Tim Burton casting job, while she doesn't jump off the pages to the screen as Miss Peregrine, she does fit the role in the way Johnny Deep did in the Chocolate Factory or Michael Keaton did in Beetlejuice. She was an important part of the story, but she wasn't the whole story. The real star of the show to me was Asa Butterfield as Jake. His character does jump off the page directly to screen, as Butterfield gives one hell of a performance. Butterfield has been acting since the rip old age of nine, and almost every role he's had has been a leading role. There's a reason for that, and as with Hugo, The Boy In The Stripped Pajamas, and Ender's Game, he proves why yet again in this film. Miss Peregrine is a terrific book, that honestly shouldn't work well as a film, but when you add Tim Burton and his eccentricities, the experience of Samuel L. Jackson, & the raw talent of Asa Buttefield to the mix, you get a unique and special film, that while not the same as the book, it's just as good in a different kind of way.",

The third act is what every action movie has for a third act nowadays (not gonna give spoilers, but I bet you can guess), but it`s not bad... it is okeyy.

      "text": "I know Tim Burton's name for the first time when I saw \"Batman\" (1989) (his work such as Beetlejuice never imported to Indonesia), and I saw several of his outstanding piece of work such as \"Edward Scissorhands\" \"Sleepy Hollow\" \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" \"Alice in Wonderland\" and \"Sweeny Todd\". From my experience Tim Burton's \"peculiar\" that he is very strong in visualization. It's kinda like a child's unstoppable wild imagination. So I expected so much from this movie This movie is about a community of human with special abilities that choose an awkward way to live their live, repeat one day life by creating magic loop These humans are children with special abilities that under protection of an adult protector. The film starts with Jake Portman (Asa Butterfield), a regular teenager living in suburban Florida with his awful parents and also a worker in supermarket. Since he was about 4 or 5 years old, he already been told a fantastic adventure story by his grandfather Abe (Terence Stamp), that Abe admit is his real life adventure. As years goes by, Jake's torn apart between his believe in Abe's story and the science that he learn at school that there are no such things as multi tentacle tongue monsters or children with special abilities. But these stories about monsters and \"special children\" suddenly seem like they might hold some dark truth to them after one night he found out his grandfather Abe killed with both his eyes taken. Before Abe take his last breath, still manage to ask Jake (he always call his grandson Tygritus \u2013 Tiger in Polland) to go to Wales and find Miss Peregrine. And the story goes, that finally Jake found the house only to find out that the house already burnt down on Germany bombing in Sep 3rd 1943, driven by his curiosity he entered that house and meet these peculiar children accidentally. These children then brought him to a place and magically he swan his own eyes the same house his grandfather told him about, in the same place that he know that already blown away by Germany bomber plane. Then Jake meet Miss Peregrine (Eva Green) who is capable of transforming herself into a falcon and the ability to manipulated time \u2013 which she is not the only one that can do this.Miss Peregrine has been able so far to preserve in an endless cycle (like one of Tom Cruise sci-fi movie \"Edge of Tomworrow\") the day prior to the fatal bombing by creating secret magic \"loops\" in exact time. Then Emma (Ella Purnell), the sweet blonde who has to wear lead heavy boot so she doesn't fly away. There's Olive (Lauren McCrostie), the redhead who has to wear gloves cause There's the girl with a ravenous mouth hidden on the back of her head. The invisible boy \"Wilard\"who likes to play tricks. The 8 years old girl who can make things grow super fast. The 12 years old boy who can use his eyeball to project image and finally the weird masked twins (and wear a weird costume). Frankly I got a very big hope for this movie, that I wish this movie is more then just some human with special abilities torn in good and bad side (oups...does this sound like X Men?), but turn out to be \"X-Kids\". In my personal opinion this movies shouldn't take 2 hours, because almost one hour the visionary Tim Burton failed to develop mystery chemistry into the mind of audience, even though Tim already succeeded snap my mind through the tragedy of Abe death and the creepy glance of Baroon (Samuel L.Jackson) in the first 15 minutes, but then my curiosity is just like vaporized into the air.",

What I did not like was the childish moments that peculiar children did, for example\u2026\u00a1\u00a1\u00a1SPOILER ALERT!!! take the final part when Jacob Portman tells Emma Bloom the travel that he did, and suddenly they kissed, I mean, why didn\u2019t you guys skip that part?
