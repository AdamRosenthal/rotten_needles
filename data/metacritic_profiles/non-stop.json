Since then, there are only two things certain about early action film releases; there will always be one featuring kick-ass icon Jason Statham playing the younger, balder super human hero, and one featuring Neeson, usually playing a wrinkled, more seasoned action star who could very well be your father (or grandfather)\u2013which was badass three films ago. Deep down I am secretly waiting for Hollywood to come to their senses and announce a showdown between the two action superstars. Now talk about a kick-ass early year action release that we kinda saw coming. With something as expected as a Neeson release, also comes the expectation for a cliched, unoriginal, and purely entertaining action story line. Unexpectedly collaborating again with his Unknown director Jaume Collet-Serra, Neeson buckles up for an actioner set in the sky. Unlike the highly entertaining nineties guilty pleasure Air Force One, Non-Stop seems to steer more in the direction of the wholly disastrous Flightplan. After all is said and done, the film becomes a constant re-hashing of previous wind-cutting skyline action films without much original altitude.",

Rather, the blame for Non-Stop\u2019s shortcomings goes to its inexperienced and blundering writers. By barely stringing together what may be the most convoluted action plot in recent years, the greater tension in Non-Stop comes from whether or not the writers can express an idea in its entirety or send it crashing to the ground in a ball of fire and smoke.",

I guess some people say the scenarios that take place in the film are unrealistic but honestly its nothing out of the ordinary for this genre. It seems like some people don't care if a movie is unrealistic mainly superhero movies but then with movies like this they expect realism. This is my second viewing of the movie first time was at the theaters and honestly it really did't catch my attention so that's why my first rating for it was average and i left a lazy review here but after just watching it i have to say i really enjoyed it more this time around.",

      "text": "While Non-Stop doesn't break any boundaries when concerning originality, it does make up for it by taking its namesake as literally as possible. The film (which sees air marshall Bill Marks attempting to stop a killer on board a trans Atlantic flight) manages to dabble in a lot of different areas, ranging from action and suspense to comedic one liners, and does so mainly successfully. While i wasn't gripping the arms of my seat as much as last year's Captain Phillips, most of the film's success comes from the tension created when Marks (Neeson) desperately tries to uncover the murderer whilst simultaneously attempts to keep the crowd in check. The acting is grounded throughout, with Neeson taking the fore as a unkempt man simply trying to stop what appears to be an impossible scenario from unfolding along with some impressive dramatic moments between the marshall and his increasingly worried passengers. While I won't name characters, I personally feel that the inclusion of a love interest (which felt luke warm and unnecessary) was jarring and superficial and this was one of the aspects of the film that resonated with me the least. However, there were more than a few moments that made the film stand out, particularly a climactic gun fight which sees Neeson fly down a plane aisle in zero g firing a hand gun. Overall Non-Stop is highly entertaining thriller that will certainly keep audience members guessing and one that I highly recommend and while it may not be nominated for any Oscars, it certainly has proven to be one of the more enjoyable films of this year so far.",

If there was anything that made this movie any different from the many others like it\u2019s kind it was the unique airplane setting. One thing that the setting failed to do was make you feel claustrophobic, which should have been a huge priority for the makers. Something this movie had on its side was it\u2019s cool templets used throughout to show viewers a unique perspective of the threatening texts received that lead the movie\u2019s plot. There were also some cool transitions but that's about it. In terms of script critique it was a mess from the start. Poor dialogue and bad characters rained on the pity party which started around the ten minute mark. One thing that really surprised me was how bad the acting really was. Liam Neeson does a decent job in this movie, he was just dealt a terrible storyline that no actor can carry, especially with such a lame supporting cast and a weak script (humor was interjected at the most unrealistic times, throughout the whole movie). He has played great rolls before; I loved his work in Taken and The Gray, and he was the only saving grace of this film. I often found myself yelling at the TV in frustration, out of how unrealistic the movie was. Any sort of entertainment was blocked by stupidity. Toward the end of the movie it became so overly clich\u00e9 I wanted to turn it off knowing I wouldn't miss anything; I should have done that in the beginning.

If you can overlook the conveniance of how the plot unfolds, then I guarantee an entertaining time.",

It is a high-intensity and clever mystery thriller that benefits from its isolated and close-quartered setting. Liam Neeson is fantastic as a federal air marshal fighting against the clock in a film that makes everyone suspicious. However the story is shaky at times and the supporting cast is merely used as objects, a waste of their talent. Nonetheless this film is worth a watch for its action, interesting premise, direction and of course Liam Neeson.",

My only problem with this film was it's script. Sometimes, it felt like it was trying too hard to outsmart us and it was just silly sometimes. The actors all played their part well and were all enjoyable too watch. In conclusion, it's a good thriller film that's well directed but it's mediocre script might pull you off of the film.",
