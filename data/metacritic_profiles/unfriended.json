On this front, it failed miserably.  This is total fiction.  Unless you believe that ghosts are computer-savvy, or that people using social media could be talented enough to form a collective group of 6 individuals networking to coincidentally knock off 6 people that had something to do with the death of a teenager on the date of her anniversary, this is a waste of time.

It was fun for a bit watching the teen drama unfold as they dish out each others dirty laundry but the cattiness gets annoying quick enough.

This movie has its flaws, therefore it's not a 9 or a 10 but for what it is, it does well. It's obviously an anti-bulling message. The whole movie is basically sharing the screen with the protagonist. You see her messages, ims, skypes, etc. That was a very neat concept and I praise that aspect infinitely. However, the cliches are also very obvious and the killer talks in the way that a mother would text, which kinda took away from the zing. However, the story was neat and the acting was awesome! There is also a lot of comedy thrown into the mix. It's a little bit of everything. You'll laugh your butt off and you'll also feel the dread building. Personally I'll say this is a very innovative horror movie and could've totally been a 10 but fell into too many cliches. See it if you're interested; I'm sure you'll enjoy. But it kinda sucks to know how great of a movie this could've been had it not done some of the things it did. The ending is absolutely incredible; it is one of the greatest endings to a horror movie I've seen in a while.",

(Though I'm not looking forward to much of the rest of the samey, occulty crap the industry has in the pipeline.  Vatican Papers?  Ugh.)  It fallows is more classic, retro horror, but Unfriended is horror for the new tech-savvy generation. It's a bit of a fable, really. I love the use of technology and the rules that define the action. In the same way that Blair Witch introduced the found footage element to horror, Unfriended does the Skype/YouTube thing perfectly.  Shelley Henning as Blair holds down the sympathetic lead role extremely effectively.  She's always been an underrated actress who has played the supporting role in such teen fare as Teen Wolf, Secret Circle, and Zach Stone is Gonna Be Famous, and I'm hoping that her exposure in this movie puts her into that category of actor who is considered for leads. Speaking of acting, all of the young actors in Unfriended bring a level of authenticity to the proceedings - they simply feel real. The film's only drawback - and this is something that bugs me about many horror flicks such as the Paranormals - is the excessive reliance on demons or spirits of the dead. It's almost a cop out - how does a spirit use Skype?  Oh well, don't worry about it, it's a leap!  I suppose I'm yearning for a bit more tangible reality in my horror such as the raw, depraved humanity of Rutger Hauer in The Hitcher.  But that's just nitpicking, I suppose.  If your'e looking for intensity and a horror flick with a moral message to it (\"don't bully!\"), this one will work for you.",

The film revolves around six friends who socialize in an online chat room together and mysterious things begin to occur when an account belonging to a dead girl joins their chat. This film debuted at the Fantasia Festival last year and got a wide release this spring. I like the premise of Unfriended, the internet can be a scary thing and many people really never think about how dangerous it can really be. The whole film takes part on the computer screen of Blaire Lilly (Sossaman) so if Blaire searches something on Google or checks her Facebook we get to see it all and that\u2019s an interesting way to shoot a film, but the film quickly starts to take on the characteristics of other horror movies with all these weird events occurring without any real reason. I thought the young cast did very well to start the film but I think you could begin to see cracks as the film went on. I like the way that tension builds up throughout the movie and it helped to keep me interested. The story got a little too crazy and when the tension builds up more and more the acting weakens. You will find out that everyone in this chat room is a terrible person and they are so awful that they are no longer believable. Unfriended is a film that is original enough that it can be enjoyed despite having a lack of scares. I\u2019d rather watch this than another found footage movie.",

      "text": "Literally not worth watching unless it's your first or second horror movie ever. The only thing worth noting about the movie is the way it is recorded; all through a screen. But really, as original as that may be, it just ends up making the whole experience worse. When a character dies, you don't get scared, you don't feel pity; it's just \"oh, haha, that guy died, what was his name again?\". Yes, they are that forgettable. This whole movie is incredibly forgettable. I came here expecting an average score of 35, because let's be real here, it doesn't deserve any more than that.",

In a way it's refreshing to see an original movie but in saying that, there are some ideas that are just too ridiculous/stupid etc. to even be considered. How this movie got funding I'll never understand. It's an hilariously terrible, so bad and not even close to scary, epic fail of a movie. Simply laugh out loud funny.",

      "text": "Firstly, Unfriended is one of the worst films I have ever experienced. It's worse than the Paranormal Activity Franchise. The actors in unfriended are terrible, it feels as if they are just reading their words off a script that is in front of them. People are saying that the video call format for the film is creative. No. It isn't creative, it is because the film is low budget. Also, half the film is a mouse moving around the screen and clicking on random crap. If I wanted to spend half an hour watching a mouse move around a screen I would give my grandma a computer and watch her try to work it for half the film. The story plot is OK until you realise that the thing killing all the friends is actually the ghost of Laura. She committed suicide because of a video of her passed out on the floor with poo on her leg. Another thing I want to complain about is the unoriginality of the film. 'Lets play a game', I wonder what film we have heard that quote in... People that are saying that it's tense and scary properly get scared of their own shadow. Overall, the film is a waste of time and I don't recommend it to anyone under the age of 10.",

It wouldn't be bad but you're literally watching 5 people talk on skype and type messages on facebook for however long this movie is. On top of that the story line is completely predictable at every turn. Skip this movie if you value your time.",
