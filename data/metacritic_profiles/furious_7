The end sequence that uses Wiz Khalifa's \"See You Again\" is perhaps one of the most tender moment in movies I've seen in a long time, which is so amped up because Paul Walker was not present in the completion of filming this movie due to his unfortunate death.  Seeing a character that was digitally entered into scenes at times was incredible because I never knew the difference.  Furious 7 will certainly please the fans of the series, and if you're an action movie connoisseur then this is an easy recommendation.

Easily the best movie in the franchise so far and seems like they merged all of the past movies together to create this behemoth. This awesome epic is filled with ACTION, CARS, WOMEN, FIGHTING and MUSCLES. It is constantly shouting at you and is the most spectacular action movie I have seen. In the past Fast and Furious movies there was one big job at the end of the movie but in Furious 7 there is a sequence of big events and the long run time is definitely worth it. Jason Statham brings what this franchise needed: a rememberable, badass villain and Tyrese Gibson brings back that comedy vibe with funny jokes and humour. I was a little disappointed not to see more of the Rock however but this mega cast has great chemistry and history. The movie is topped off with an emotional tribute to Paul Walker. The only real negative is that I am unsure how they will top this amazing movie for Furious 8 and be sure to catch it in the cinema for the best experience.",

The action is entertainingly over-the-top, the humor is actually pretty good and the homage they did to the late Paul Walker is well put together. One other problem I had with \"Furious 7\" -- aside from its silly story -- was Vin Diesel. I know a lot of people like him, but I found him to be particularly bland in this film.

But, 'Fast Five' and 'F&F; 6' things really begun to take flight. And, I never thought I'd say this, but \"Furious 7\" is a damn fine action film. It unashamedly defies logic, but the quality of the action sequences is stunning. And, there's no way you won't get the goosebumps in Paul Walker's first and final scene. \"F7\" is somewhat darker and grimmer, and there's something about James Wan's direction that makes the film breathe, unlike many of its peers. It's thrilling, exhausting and a heck of a lot of fun.",
