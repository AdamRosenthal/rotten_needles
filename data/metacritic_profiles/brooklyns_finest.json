This movie should be called Brooklyn's Crappiest because that's what it is. As a person that grew up in Brooklyn, NY in between  Sunset Park and Bay Ridge, believe me when I say this is not Brooklyn's Finest. The only thing this movie has right is the scenery and that's not saying much, but because it made me almost feel like I was back in BK it gets a 6 out of 10. I wanted to see these so called \"Finest\" at their finest hour(s) not their worst hour(s). This movie almost makes Brooklyn look bad in most peoples eyes when sadly it really is not. Brooklyn and Queens are by far the best and nicest places to live in New York City. If you want to watch a good movie checkout: The Departed, American Gangster, or even Serpico.",
