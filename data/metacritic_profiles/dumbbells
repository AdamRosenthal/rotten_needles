I expected plenty of gym humor and hot girls (which there are -- Taylor Cole is movie star beautiful) but there's also a ton of hilarious talented comedic performances from the whole cast. Brian Drolet and Hoyt Richards are a great comic duo. The loan manager (who is that guy?) is priceless and Mircea Monroe is perfect as the ex-girlfriend from Hell. I guess you couldn't have a gym comedy without Fabio and he actually reveals some real comic muscles. Who knew? I thought all the cameos were fun. Carl Reiner, Jaleel White and Jay Mohr all scored. Overall, it just a lighthearted romp with tons of classic one-liners. This is one gym I'll be happy to go back to.",

In a world full of hate and negative boring people with any values, the movie spreads a big dose of Humor without any doubt. Creative fun only can be understood by smart people.
