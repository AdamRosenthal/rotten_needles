Et franchement, ce n'est pas avec 12 Rounds (renomm\u00c3\u00a9 Shoot & Run) que le r\u00c3\u00a9alisateur va remonter la pente. Il en est m\u00c3\u00aame encore tr\u00c3\u00a8s loin, car ce film est d'une banalit\u00c3\u00a9, d'une invraisemblance et d'un manque de fond inimaginables. En somme, ce film n'est qu'une simple resuc\u00c3\u00a9e d'Une Journ\u00c3\u00a9e en Enfer (\u00c3\u00a0 croire que Harlin voulait faire son Die Hard 3) dont la mise en sc\u00c3\u00a8ne clipesque lorgne vers le cin\u00c3\u00a9ma de Tony Scott sans jamais l'\u00c3\u00a9galer (et sans compter la pauvret\u00c3\u00a9 du casting, du script et des dialogues). Bref, un v\u00c3\u00a9ritable \u00c3\u00a9chec. Alors pourquoi ne pas mettre une note plus basse? Juste par le fait que, finalement, on se laisse tout de m\u00c3\u00aame prendre au jeu pour passer le temps devant ce film \u00c3\u00a0 l'action non-stop abrutissant, qui ne vaut en rien les grands films d'action des 80's.",

It's a beat the clock thriller from the director of Die Hard and was a million times better than I thought it would be. John Cena defiantly shows a marked improvement from The Marine, no doubt thanks to Renny Harlin. Yes, it's a WWE film, staring a WWE wrestler, but it's one hell of an action thriller!",
