The narrative is simple and overly episodic, the message is simple, the central conceit is odd and possibly of little value (why is featuring dinosaurs in a western any better than just doing a western?), the film doesn't make use of it's own ticking clock device very well and the design choices probably won't work for everyone. However, the incredibly strong character work, especially the central relationship between Arlo and Spot, carry the film over these rough patches and make it all work on a visceral emotional level without ever tipping into manipulation. It doesn't hurt that this is the most visually stunning work that Pixar has ever done. So, it won't live along side Toy Story, Up and Inside Out, but it's better than Cars. Take that for what it's worth.",

The protagonists, Arlo and Spot were both very likeable and Sam Elliot gave a solid vocal performance as Butch the T-Rex. Speaking of T-Rexes, I think Pixar deserve some recognition for making him a good guy rather than a villain or an obstacle, like most dinosaur movies do. As well as visually stunning, the movie was quite emotional- which isn't surprising for a Pixar movie.

Not bad, it is not that great and not reach of the height of Inside Out, is just good. The Problems of The Good Dinosaur are 1- The script is clich\u00e9 (Arlo's father dies, \"that original\") 2 The villains, I thought it was a story that needed no villains like Inside Out, but surprise, they had villains. Thunderclap and his team of \"rescuers\" want to eat the caveman boy. That's pretty stupid, they have thousands of stray animals and just want to eat one. And 3- the designs of the characters they don't fit with the beautifusl and realistics backgrounds. Why they didn't do betters designs and look realistic as Dinosaur (2000)?. and I thought it would be the worst of Pixar, but it is not so bad. The backgrounds are beautiful, the voices are decent, the animation is good and the music is beautiful, but the problem of The Good Dinosaur is that don't feel like a Pixar film is more Disney. But at least no worse than Cars 2. I happy i having i saw and has not obtained the nomination to the academy. They didn't deserve it",

If you make a film too realistic looking, does it take away from the animation experience?

The movie felt like Roger Rabbit at times, which used animated characters in a live action film.

The Good Dinosaur has not been considered as one of the Pixar greats, which to me is baffling considering this is probably one of the best Pixar have ever made. The animation is fantastic as ever, and the Voice acting is on point as well. Much like Finding Nemo and Inside Out, you know what will happen at the end, but the journey to that end is a lot less predictable. The plot is another Pixar masterpiece and the ending of the film is my faviroute ending to a Pixar film ever (Not counting Inside Out). However there were some unnecessary elements in the film, that would have made the film much more simple if taken out. Also, the film felt different to most other Pixar films, possibly because of the lack of Comedy. The main character (Arlo) also felt slightly clich\u00e9d. However none of this took away my interest from the film, and that is why at the start of my review, I said that his the most underrated piece of cinema in 2015.",
