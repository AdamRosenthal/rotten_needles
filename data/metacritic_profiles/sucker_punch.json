The other mash up involved here that is interesting is how it jumps from the 40s style burlesque era to a strange, steampunk like world in the fantasies.  This is, in no way, a perfect movie, and I'm not about to try to convince anyone that it has the best acting, CG, stunts or anything.  What I did like was that the movie got me interested in the girls' dilemmas and even though there wasn't much background except on Baby Doll, Rocket and Sweet Pea, there was enough there to make me want to see them make it to the end.  The idea that this girl, Baby Doll transforms so drastically from a school girl to a heroine in her alternate reality is just... well... cool.   It's all silliness in the end but the fact is there is some great entertainment in this movie if you let go of the critic in you and just enjoy it for what it is.  An action thriller.

A mix of elements that I personally love it! Japan with its feudal warriors, orcs and dragons, robots, WWII ... I loved the references.  The music choice was perfect. I can not stop listening! And Emily Browning really can sing! I loved the version of Sweet Dreams at the beginning! However, the film also has several drawbacks... First, the performances, just say it were a little disappointing, the girls could have had more charisma. I didn't found so captivating. But surely, Carla Gugino and Oscar Isaac were great! The script is weak, could have been much better handled, but it seems that the focus of the film was in fact the action. It even tries to pass a moral interesting, but it seemed that only remembered it at the beginning and end of the movie. Everything is a bit exaggerated and even! And the fights seemed like real games! But I think it will its acceptance of the film. After all, it all goes through the mind of Babydoll, so anything can happen. Ultimately, I think it's worth seeing if you like the theme. There is not an excellent script, but an action is really nice to watch.",

However saying ANY MORE will reduce your enjoyment of this movie. Just don't go in expecting 300 with chicks. This has more in common with an episode off the Twilight Zone than 300 (aside's from Snyder's son) and because of this I thoroughly enjoyed it.

While I can see why people say the movie is misogynistic, I don't think it is at all, or rather it is only superficially so.  Yes, the girls in it are victimized, yes the costuming is straight from Victoria's Secret, but if you look behind that, at what the film says about the characters you see something very different.  Baby Doll (a supremely ironic name for someone as tough as she) is in a terrible situation.  She is locked away in an asylum with a timetable for lobotomy, most people would curl up into a mewling, whining ball n her place (I know I would;.  Baby Doll does, not, almost before the key turns in the lock behind her she is plotting escape.  From the opening seconds she is overmatched and outgunned. Yet, throughout, in her fantasy world and more importantly in real life she never gives up, ultimately engaging in an act of  self-sacrifice. She wears a skimpy skirt, that's the outside, inside she is consistently brave, loyal, resourceful and resilieant. At the beginning of the film she has an opportunity to kill her hated stepfather. She doesn't take it, an act that hints at the real strength of her character.  This is not a movie by a man who hates women, but by a man who loves and admires  women in a man's sort of way.",

The film's fight sequences don't hold up with the main story most times, and neither does the soundtrack a couple of times, but I didn't care one bit. I'm saw the Rotten Tomatoes score and set my standards low for watching this, and I enjoyed the film for what it was: hot chicks jumping around fighting in skimpy clothing, explosions, dragons, gunfights, sword fights, and blimps exploding. Some of the actors are good, like Emily Browning, Jamie Cheung, Abbie Cornish, and the guy who plays the stepfather, but some are pretty campy, like Vanessa Hudgens (as Blondie, a brunette whose name is Blondie), and Oscar Issacs. One stands out as the worst, which is Carla Gugino as Dr. Gorski, who's supposed to be playing a Polish doctor, but her accent waivers from Germany (Ja?) (or to gamers, probably Wakkan, ja?) to Russian (aCCcentuate the \"CCCCCC\" sound with plenty of phlegm) instead. And the dialogue is so stock and so lame that it makes Tommy Wisseau look like Charlie Kaufman. The action scenes, while extremely well done, come out of nowhere, even inside an already existing fantasy (she imagines sword fighting and gun fighting while on a stage at a brothel dancing while on a stage in the mental institution dancing [and no, that's not a typo]), and lack any logic to the point of total anachronism (helicopters in medieval times, samurais with huge guns in feudal Japan, and zombies in Nazi-Germany, girls in the 50s imagining using 21st century M-16s, MP-5s, and high tech mechas with a jet pack and an internal computer-powered aiming system during WWII, and trying to destroy high-tech bombs on a 20th century monorail), and most times have little to no attachment to the storyline (what the hell does fighting a dragon have to do with stealing a lighter, or dismantling a bomb have to do with stealing a knife, or even Japanese wise men have to do with go-go dancing?). The characters most times are irrational. For example, Babydoll clearly hears that Blue will forge Dr. Gorski's signature to get her lobotomized. She never takes into consideration telling Dr. Gorski, the only person who can allow lobotomies and is against the procedure, to cancel it and have Blue arrested, nor does Dr. Gorski call the police when Blue shoots two of the patients. Also, the message, suspense, and emotion are lost in translation, because Snyder refused to give anyone else any detailed exposition as much as Babydoll, instead of giving everyone ample exposition so that it can be anyone's story, and have its dramatic twist work. There is no way to soften up or sugar-coat the fact that this movie truly sucks, but it's just simply eye candy. Take it or leave it. Is it one of the greatest? PFFFT-HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA, NO!! Is it one of the best of the year? PFFFT-HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA, NO!! Is it an entertaining movie for those with the mindset of a guy who wants to see hot girls in glorious action sequences and nothing else? Completely.",

The message of the movie which was basically only you can control your fate, & you have the weapons, so fight for it, was simple yet the way it's presented was fantastic, each world was well designed. And whoever who thought the plot was 'overly simple', well your brain is the one that's simple, it was intruiging & kept me thinking, even after the movie, I was still mindf***ed! I'm watching it again this weekend, the movie was awesome, it keeps me wanting more. The music was great as well, fitted each scene perfectly, you can't compare it to any movie, its definitely way more complicated then Inception, I have to say. Everyone go see it, it was totally worth my $9. The only thing I didn't quite like was the length, which was too short, it could use some character development, so I could understand each character better, it could have been longer, but still it was fantastic, just a minor flaw, so definitely a 10/10! I LOVED IT, IT WAS AWESOME, it was good to finally see some originality in a movie, even though how everyone thought the concept was simple, no one could have done it better then Zack Snyder, this definitely goes into my list of favourite movies of all time! Most entertaining & intruiging movie this year!",

I see absolutely no flaw in this movie. I was never bored while watching this, which I can't say for the majority of movies I have seen in my life, including some of my favorites. The cutaway dream sequences were awesome to watch and made the movie better as a whole. The plot was solid and engaging. The only problem I have is not with the movie, but it's reviews. I suppose critics are just so jaded that when something good actually good comes out, but seems demeaning to women or something, it must be taken down. I've read the comment that this movie has good graphics but a bad story many times and all I can think is \"What do you think Avatar is?\". At least Sucker Punch is like nothing else that has ever been in theaters. Though I do have to admit to the fact that this movie does target a select audience, specifically young people. The movie basically revolves around the interests of 13-30 year olds. So I suppose people who don't fall in to that category might not see eye to eye with what this movie has to offer. To those people I say, don't watch it. If you didn't want to see a movie with scantily-clad  women killing things, don't watch that movie. All in all, this is an opinion, like any review, so I will finish by saying that it is a great movie, as long as it pertains to your interests. Otherwise, don't watch it.    P.S. I know I said that this review is my opinion, but I thought it should be known that it is a    fact that it is my opinion, so in a way, it is fact (this comment is also targeted to the same audience as Sucker Punch)",

      "text": "Before the movie I had those negative reviews from the critics in the back of my mind, and I found that they weren't accurate at all. Right from the start of the movie to the end, I didn't look around, didn't talk and really tried to engage myself into it, and I came out of the theatres amazed and inspired. I couldn't figure out how some reviews said it was terrible or even sexist. This was one of those movies where you obviously can't just watch it and say \"oh that was bad\" or \"oh that was good\", you literally had to put yourself into it or watch it with your heart, may sound stupid but you could feel these powerful mixed emotions of the characters like how babydoll's mother died and she was alone and even more depressed after her sister's death (not a spoiler but from the synopsis) if you payed attention you would probably feel the same way. If your parents died and you accidently killed your siblings in the midst of protecting them then placed in an unpleasant environment and forced to do unpleasant things to survive, how would you feel or what would you choose? To simply die, or to fight for your survival or what's left of it? Sure the actors were hot girls in hot outfits, and dancing around, playing with guns like what many have called \"a fantasy for 13 year old boys\" but that is an understatement.The girls were part of the main aspects but that shouldn't be the only thing you would to be watching for. They all had struggles and it showed how they chose to fight instead of just giving in and it wasn't just about how they dressed as well as how many people thought it was \"pretending to be a feminist fable of empowerment\". It showed on screen, and by using the dream to portray how they're able to gain courage from battling all these grotesque creatures and situations they can deal with what's in reality and it may seem even less difficult to do so, how anything is possible and this showed powerful emotions, not just boring,pointless,or even pure violence. Zack Snyder's actors were all female, and they all \"chose\" to audition for it, if it was sexist and overall a stupid, terrible, and unclear story then he wouldn't have a cast. Also his cast would not have put so much effort in their training for the movie as well as finding their deep inner emotions just so they can portray the pain for their characters.This movie can be confusing to understand at times, but it was a movie where you really had to let it sink in. It's not where if you looked away for a moment then came back to it, you would understand what was going on, you had to watch everything little bit of it. There was so much emotions along with the music, there was no need for too much dialogue, it showed that is if you payed attention and not forcing yourself to stay the whole 2 hours just to finish the movie. Sucker Punch deserves so much more credit, and I really think that these \"Critics\" should reconsider rewatching it, and this time \"actually watching\" it, meaning engaging yourself into everything whether it was the music, the dialogue, the expressions, the emotions, the story, the visuals, just everything, whereas you're just watching any average film where you can take washroom breaks, look around or somewhere, then leave. All I can say is this movie was brilliant, not a masterpiece but it was something, and it was not as bad as it \"seemed\" just because of how some people saw it as \"a fantasy world for little boys watching hot girls gunning down zombies and fighting samurais.\"",

I have enjoyed most of Snyder's previous films, especially Watchman, and I knew from the trailer, the potential that this movie had. Zack has always seemed, to me, like the perfect director for bringing all of the style and panache that we have come to love from our favorite Comic, Anime, and Video Game franchises, to the big screen. I was very excited about this movie, because it represented the next step forward in legitimizing this over the top style that has seemed uniquely present in the pages of our comics, and the CGI sequences of our favorite games.  As I watched this movie it was everything that I hoped that it would be and more. I was fairly content with the idea that the story would be secondary in my mind, to the face value of bringing the true spirit of neo-fantasy to a cinematic experience. Unlike many of you who watched this movie, I was pleasantly surprised by the story and the more I contemplated the various levels, and abstract concepts, the more impressed I was with this vehicle.  One of the great aspects to this movie is that Snyder essentially turns our imagination upside down by presenting to us the fantasy and all the while forcing us to imagine reality. The imaginative lengths that Baby goes to in order to conceive of and envision what it will take for her and her friends to survive, where inspiring. The central theme of empowerment through imagination seems to be lost to the very critics who fail to tap into their own imaginations. If this movie suffers, it is only because the normative standard of movie making require that Snyder\u00e2",

The story was passable, the action sequences were beautiful and it was all visually compelling, the only special effects that a Snyder movie can give. But what I really love about the movie is the rocking soundtrack, my favourite was Sweet Dreams in the opening sequence of the movie, sang by Emily Browning herself. Female empowerment and the fight for freedom are the main themes of the movie. It's about a woman taking control of her own destiny. To be honest, the hook for me to watch this was Emily, I really liked her in Lemony Snickets and have been waiting years for an exciting new movie from her, didn't really like The Uninvited. And now I understand why Christopher Nolan chose Zack Snyder for the reboot of Superman, he's another visionary filmmaker doing something rarely seen in Hollywood anymore, an original project.

There is no doubt that Zack is one of the best Directors out there right now, but his film's aren't for everyone, especially in the case of Sucker Punch. As I like to say, he creates action art, his film may not be outstanding when it comes to story telling, but the man knows how to Direct. Sucker Punch is an absolute fun time, and is probably one of the most enjoyable films of the year, unless you're an uptight snobby critic who only enjoys films like 'The Kings Speech'. It has it's moments where I would think to myself, \"I'm not sure if that worked\" but it didn't happen enough for me to have anything bad to say about this film. There is no reason I wont be seeing this film at least 3 more times in theaters. The acting is fantastic, the story is a bit off key, but the Directing is why I'm giving this a 10 out of 10.

I've read  professional \"critics\" write about how outlandish some of the scenes are, but I think that they kinda missed the whole point of the movie. Yes, it is outlandish; and no, the seemingly random fight scenes really don't tie into reality, but that's the beauty of it. The battle sequences take place in a fantasy within a fantasy and primarily serve as metaphors for missions or tasks that Baby Doll (the main character) et al. must accomplish. So, yes, these all take place in Baby Doll's imagination so they're allowed to be as unrealistic and outlandish as she wants it to be. My main gripe with this movie, however, is that Zack Synder (the director) was forced to maintain a PG13 movie, and the movie really seemed like he had been severely crippled and forced to work with one hand tied behind his back. Snyder is best known for his highly stylized and gory action sequences, but the ones in this movie just didn't seem on the same level as his other hits, \"300\" and \"Watchmen\". If only he'd been allowed to go all out and make his usual rated R or unrated movie, I think things would've turned out much better.",

Sucker Punch's box office in the US (in particular) has been destroyed by critics, in a colossal misreading of both its merits and intentions. The worst misreading, in fact, since most of them accused Paul Verhoeven of being a fascist after the release of Starship Troopers. Sucker Punch is, quite simply, an art film disguised as a typical action blockbuster. The film's title gives that away. Go into it with a mindset open to something different - this is a film whose genetic DNA is shared not with typical video game films or typical action blockbusters, but rather films like Brazil, The Fifth Element and Kill Bill, all of which were heavy in style and divided audiences based on audience preconceptions. See it and let the incredible art design and the crazy mash-ups of influences wash over you. Enjoy the powerful music-video structure of several key scenes. Enjoy the genuine, powerful feminist undercurrent. Question the ways in which you view women. And try to spot all the self-referential symbolism that permeates the \"layers\" of the film (check out the bunny!). A cult film for a new generation, in every possible way. Fascinating, uplifting and ultimately tragic from beginning to end. Were there really five girls, or just five personalities in the mind of one girl?

A few more words on the (SPOILER ALERT) imaginations--I wish they found a way to fit the fantasy action bits with the real world. For instance, when the plan is to hold everyone's attention while one girl sneaks into the backroom to copy a map, at least do a scene with 4 girls holding the front to cover for the last girl. As it stands now, we get similar gun fights for 10 minute stretches, totally irrelevant to where the plot is.

Oscar Isaac was so great as Blue, and the young female cast was good too, like Browning, and especially Abbie Cornish and Jena Malone as sisters.

I witnessed an older couple walk out of the film after the first action scene and realized they must have been offended by the imagery and seemingly stereotypical content. I usually don't read reviews,  but I had done so before with inception when I wasn't sure if the spinning top was about to topple or continuing.. I read a wonderful review that explained older actors were used in the end and it indeed wobbled for the first time. I was extremely disappointed to find there wasn't one decent review out there that didn't tear this film apart. Critics, I have come to conclude, don't have the balls to SEE what this film is really about, because A) They are feminist offended by the visuals and scenes, or B) they are afraid of other feminists coming after them.  The rendition of where is my mind in the beginning is pure genius. If you have seen Fight Club its a foreshadowing that this girl has truly lost her mind, which accounts for her wanting, the lobotomy at the end. From that point on, I knew to expect this girl would enter a subreality, as was the outcome of fight club, and similar to it, she fought where she was empowered in her sub-sub reality despite all outside oppression.  I was left to realize this girl must have been left so afraid and intrusting of men, after the horrors of her step-father, that she fantasized herself in a brothel,as this is shat she had come to expect of men, and possibly the way in which the men of this all girls ward, abused and exploited these \"sick\" girls whom nobody would believe. The only reason I I researched the film to begin with was because I was unsure if babydoll killed her sister or if her stepfather had. I don't know if the director left it open for interpretation becarhe felt it was irrelevant,  but there is a scene where baby doll admits she has done something she deeply regrets but I doubt she'd regret shooting a man that killed her sister. Another hing, some critic reviews bash the use of the names. First of all, the entire film is a fresh of breath air to a morbid reality  that could have been and has been in the real world, its a form of comic relief and mental escape to an other rise sinister reality.  Contrary to the critic's beliefs, babydoll is not her real name, they are their stage names of the sub reality.  Come on guys.",

The action was fresh, the set pieces were unique, and everything in the movie made my imagination go nuts. All in all, I was tremendously entertained and I am sad to see that something different from the norm is getting shot down without a fair shake. The story made sense but I could see if you're not paying attention how you can miss it. The plot: Girl gets framed by jealous step-father because he wasn't in the will of the girl's step mother. Step-father takes girl to asylum where he bribes an orderly to forge paperwork and have the girl lobotomized. The movie is about her trying to escape from the asylum. The movie has a very \"Wizard of Oz\" feel to it where items and characters that were in the asylum with the girl get transformed and become part of the girl's delusion.  Everything that happens that's NOT the asylum is part of the delusion.  The setting of the movie subtley changes from being at the asylum to being at a brothel where the crooked orderly changes from an orderly to the head cheese of the establishment.   From there, since its not reality, everything and anything can go (flying monkeys excluded). Really, my conclusion is if you like Zach Snyder action movies, you should watch this movie. Really if you love visual eye candy you should watch this movie. This movie, while not one I would watch 8 gazillion times in a theater is worth watching at least once (and I think the second time will be even better than the first), its a movie that when it comes out on Blu-ray, I'll pick it up and watch it every once in awhile.",

Unfortunately, they are simply very expensive fantasy/sci-fi set pieces, ways for Snyder to put everything swirling around in his head on the screen, story, characterization and thematic relevance be damned. Don't be fooled, this is not a \"empowered feminist\" type of film.

Sent to a mental institution, Baby Doll reimagines the hospital facilities as a bordello, run by an impresario known as Blue(Oskar Issac) and a Polish dance instructor named Vera(Carla Gugino), where she and the other femme inmates dance in provocative outfits for men. To escape the humiliation of being objectified, Baby Doll slips into a dream state, but the diversionary scenarios in which she and the other girls make like bad-ass action stars occur in masturbatory landscapes that are wholly male constructions, fanboy-imagined designs. It's **** not female empowerment, when the women discharge their firearms. They're sex objects, not heroes. Baby Doll knows what boys like: fire-breathing dragons, Japanese robots, and steampunk zombie Nazis. The Lennox Institute for the Mentally Insane could have been anything: a circus, a lawyer's firm, a newspaper company, but Baby Doll was molested(or worse) by her stepfather, so it's not surprising that she sees herself as a prostitute working in a whorehouse, since many women who make their living in the sex industry are reported to have been abused as children. \"Where is My Mind?\", featured prominently in Fincher's \"Fight Club\", solidifies the \"Janie's Got a Gun\" connection, since a cover version(sung by Browning herself, backed by Yoav) of the Pixies classic plays over the soundtrack in \"Sucker Punch\" while the doctor prepares Baby Doll for a lobotomy procedure. If the filmmaker was serious about feminism, he would have included a dreamy interlude where the abused young woman exacts some vigilante justice on her sleazy stepdad. It's infuriating how the father gets to keep all of Baby Doll's inheritance money. At the very least, she could have dispatched Sweet Pea(Abbie Cornish) to do her bidding. Quite appropriately, when Sweet Pea boards the bus during the film's final scene, the Wise Man(Scott Glenn), the man who was guiding our protagonist, is behind the wheel. In \"Sucker Punch\", the sisters aren't doing it for themselves. They're kicking ass for the sexual gratification of teenaged boys. It's a man who is driving this bus, a man who pays feminism mere lip service as an excuse to remake \"Showgirls\" without any gratuitous pelvic gyrations and moneymaker shaking(the film cuts away each time to a dream sequence, therefore preserving its PG-13 rating). Where's Steven Tyler, noted humanitarian, when you need him?",

      "text": "I'm not a professional movie reviewer or movie critic, I'm just an average joe who saw this movie today. Sucker Punch sets the premise of Babydoll (Emily Browning) who is sent to an insane asylum due to her wicked stepfather who wants her taken care of in any means necessary (a  lobotomy) to inherit the estate from the will of his deceased wife and other daughter.  Having set the dark and gritty atmosphere at start and throughout the film within the asylum remained consistent.  Having Babydoll enter the asylum she is quickly introduced to the owners and captors known as Blue (Oscar Isaac), Madam Gorski (Carla Gugino) and the High Roller (Jon Hamm).  She also meets various inmates such as Rocket (Jena Malone), Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens), Amber (Jamie Chung), and Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish).  Babydoll who is new to people and surroundings is left feeling scared and is shown to portray the keep to yourself characteristic.  That is until she bravely saves Rocket from the cook who angrily traps her in a corner by intercepting them and holding a knife to his throat, Rocket shows her trust and loyalty to Babydoll by recalling this particular incident to the other inmates profusely during the movie.  It is revealed early in the movie that Babydoll and the inmates are kept there to perform dance routines for the Blue and High Roller through a series or provocative dances.  At first, Babydoll is reluctant to do anything in the dance area with her friends and the instructor (Madam Gorski) but because she wants to escape the place, she fades reality with an imaginary fantasy world which contain samurais, nazi zombies, dragons, and robot-like guards on board a train with a bomb.  She eventually learns from The Wise Man (Scott Glenn) she needs five specific items in order to be set free from the place/captors and with the help of her friends she grew fond of, they aid her in the task.  My impression of this movie was it did held my interest from start to finish through plot, characters, and the action sequences.  These three key elements came together solidly well.  During the fantasy world sequences, the music played part in adding intensity between the girls fighting the monsters.  Acting sufficed, but what truly shined was the fantasy worlds and action sequences with its beauty and simplicity.  What was interesting to know of was that this film was directed by Zack Snyder, who also directed Watchmen and 300.  Felt the fighting scenes within the fantasy realms was directed in a way which captivated myself as an audience member.  To conclude, I felt this movie definitely was worth the money and I eagerly await the DVD.",

But almost half fun for those hottest girls with terrific costumes to fight in the confusion of the video game world that surrounds the atmosphere, it's really cool. Although, the story is out of place that there's no explanation about the story that it didn't tell anything about the movie from the beginning to the end, it's really downsize of the entire movie that falls down of the silly scenes that keeps going and wondering what the story is really about. But at the time, it's almost good to the bad film and that's okay that it brings the girls into action and Synder is trying hard for the movie, it really brings the intention to a clever movie.

I wonder if this is the result of the studio trying to draw in the younger generation so they had to pull some good stuff to get the PG-13 rating??  Or simply the story was never meant to be good and the CGI was the mass appeal. Not so much for me.  I could hardly make it through the movie.

      "text": "On principle, this is the worst film I have ever seen in my entire life. I felt like I'd been tricked into sitting through a funeral because my favorite band were playing. If you're unsure how that would feel, call it an apt description of sitting through this abomination. This film takes all of the draws of box office cinema such as visceral action and sex appeal and applies it in all of the wrong places. Not to prove a point, though the narrative certainly highlights the plot, but rather to leave a bad taste in your mouth. It is a manipulative, subversive film, it objectifies hot girls through over the top action intended to symbolize an escape from being pimped out and sexually abused in a mental asylum. The average male cinema goer will look at those women, just like the perverted criminals abusing them, simply because they are shown a stylized version of otherwise disgusting events. Perhaps this is the point, a sick joke at society, at how everything is over-sexualized for entertainment and how the truth is often implied rather then seen, but honestly, I felt like taking a shower afterwards, that is how dirty it made me feel. It is as tactless as telling a dead baby joke to someone whose child has just died. It is like watching One Flew Over The Cuckoos Nest and 300 simultaneously and in doing so it trivializes a dark, serious plot.  On the point of plot, I don't mind cinema with serious, graphic content, it wasn't the disturbing nature of the story, rather the narrative, the way it was told. Plenty of projected morals of freedom, plenty of inspiring narrated monologues, even an anti-stereotypical lead, a young girl portrayed as strong and bold, as opposed to vulnerable. Alice in Wonderland is an obvious comparison for the key ideas of the story, and while you can look into Alice, and interpret it as having darker undertones, it can also been seen and whimsical and fantastical, a child daydreaming, and many consider it a children's book. The point being that you can make a film about escaping from reality where the reality doesn't imply her sister and mother being killed by her step father in the first five minutes, before being thrown into a mental asylum to be medically turned into a vegetable while still sane. You cannot ask for a darker, more emotionally disturbing plot line, but the way it is delivered is subversive and purely disturbing through the layering of reality, fantasy and fantasy within a fantasy. Those who support the film could argue that is quite intentional to heighten the reality through the unbelievability of the fantasy and I'm sure it is, but the result is sickening, the way it objectifies mentally abused girls and trivializes serious events to the point the morals no longer carry weight. One could argue it was tongue in cheek, as exemplified through the scene where a character is 'acting' out the lobotomy on a stage being performed by hot nurses, refusing to do the scene on principal, but I didn't find myself laughing at the joke. It is clear the film is about the beneath the surface shock factor, what is unseen and implied rather then in your face gore. There is hardly a drop of blood in the whole film, and the film makes a direct point of not killing living humans during the fantasy action sequences. This eye candy, is sickeningly sweet, emphasis on the sickening, due to it's implications and while the old horror directors motto of being more scared of the shadow then the monster applies, the context is one to make you vomit in your mouth. I imagine the director would be proud of this response he has elicited, but I'd like to clarify that I'm not shocked, rather contemptuous of what I'd claim to be the worst story ever 'told'. In attempting to be surprising, confronting and daring, showing them something new, the only excitement the director provided me with was going home. Manipulative, subversive, off-putting, trivializing emotionally dak content through deception, this is the 'arty' box office cinema equivalent of a graphic horror film with flimsy moral justification for utter vulgarity.",

It's like a Tekken game or something, where you just get to oggle these ladies, but that's not such a bad thing. Where it falls flat on it's face is that the story is atrocious; I think that whoever wrote this is convinced it's good, especially because of the ending monologue which is one of the worst things I have ever heard. It makes no sense and thinks it's really clever, but it simply isn't. This is part of the reason the film is funny, because there are parts that are so ridiculous, try to take themselves seriously and just wind up being very funny. There is a part where someone dies, and you get the feeling it's supposed to be dramatic and stuff, but it's just hilarious.

      "text": "Thiz is my most anticipated movie for thiz year. And ended up exactly as I expected, it is a mega visual feast that I have ever seen since THE MATRIX (1999). In the hand of Zack Snyder (Director), everything has been set to a new level in height and adrenaline rush, I am talking about the visualisation aspect here. When 300 (2006) was booming, people keep questioning: whether Snyder was only able to assemble 300 muscly and brawny men to do those macho things? Well, now for the answer he brings us five sexy and deadly ladies to fight against Giant Samurai and Vicious Dragon in alternative World War II! Actually, the story centers on a girl named Baby Doll (Emily Browning) who is accused as a rebel and placed into mental institution. In that place, she meets Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish), Rocket (Jena Malone), Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens), Amber (Jamie Chung). Together, they are setting up an escape plan through some reality and fantasy experiences. To accomplish the mission, they have to collect five items which are: a map, fire, a knife, a key and one last mysterious element. Emily Browning is perfectly cast as Baby Doll, her character is so innocent and unpredictably lethal at the same time. Other Casts worth mentioning here are: Carla Gugino, Oscar Isaac, Jon Hamm and the most unforgettable appearance, Scott Glenn as the Wise Man. I love the opening scene so much when it tells how Baby Doll was slandered by her abusive stepfather, the sequence tells so amazingly dramatic, dark comical and elegant. The camera movement is dynamic, the transition from one point to another is effective, and the music was superbly fit. Love every minute of it. For the ending, you might feel a little bit disappointed if you expect something more, but for me it was perfect! The ending put us in a floating situation and makes you keep wondering around even when you were walking out of theater. I always enjoy the movie which can dive into a blurred reality and explain cleverly what is the connection between the reality world. Commonly, thiz kind of movie always utters some new hidden philosophy. Just remember, If you do not stand for something, you will fall for anything.",

I could not supplant the thought of just how a film like this could make its way upon the screen.  The plot was piss poor, the characterization was god awful, and the acting forced me into a decision of whether or not to hurl my giant soda at the screen (I have never had this compulsion so vividly before; it still angers me to consider the money that I spent that fateful evening).  It is exactly what everyone would be watching if the concept behind \"Idiocracy\" became a reality:  the mainstream media becomes the only artistic license in the world, all creative vision falls away, and special effects performs a total coup d' etat on substance.  In other words, to quote Hunter S. Thompson, it is \"what the whole hip world would be doing Saturday nights if the Nazis won the war (to paraphrase).\"  I am fully aware that this movie will nonetheless do quite well financially.  However,  Snyder should be ashamed of himself.  Although his cinematography and effects can be quite masterful, I would be ashamed to call this a screenplay.  Even in those intervals while witnessing some bullets whistling through the air in slow motion in the midst of some I Robot initiated fury, I could not answer why this was happening, how these scene selections were valid in any way, or what the $%*&@# point was (to be blunt).  I never lost sight of the fact that I was in a movie theater, and that the movie would never shift into anything meaningful or even interesting.

Nicely done, although a hiring qualification for modern visual directors should be to take them outside and make them stare up at that bright yellow orb in the sky. If they can properly name it as 'The Sun' then they're hired. I bet half or more flunk, including this film's director.   Acting - 5. Now, it's not to say they had much scripting, but their green screen talents are much in evidence, and I'd even give bonus points if they did any of their own stunts.   Costume - 4. Someone call Sailor Moon and tell her her costumes were stolen, just after you get done with the inventory of all the missing costumes for Showgirls.   Soundtrack - 3. Ok, unearthing the Airplane and White Rabbit is kitchy but ok. It was rock & roll, after all, and they do just amp it up (but their cover singer is no Grace Slick, I'll tell you that, right out). But, after we hear the panoply from The Eurythmics to The Beatles and back it seems more like a transparent attempt to craft the next hipster soundtrack CD a la Pulp Fiction.    Script - ... what script? Oh, you mean the video game storyboards that passed for a script? Really, it's eye candy, but I wondered at how the test marketing worked. Was this really aimed at the 14 year old GRRRL Power crowd? If so, it misses badly with a script that is more like a recycled version of the musical Chicago meets Pan's Labyrinth. To their credit, and maybe to keep their PG rating, there is little human bloodshed. But, man do the japaname space hun nazi robot zombies get it with both barrels (and a katana).

The trailer showed mostly the fantasy scenes which are not important or even relevant to the main story of the movie at all, talk about being on the very edge of the borderline of false advertising. >_> It baffles me to no end how anyone who designed and organized the scenes in the movie though it was a good idea, cut out all the pointless fantasy crap and unnecessary bloated special effects budget and promote the movie as the serious realistic drama it was intended to be in the main storyline and it could have been somewhat decent. What an absolute abomination of film making, 20 dollars form my wallet and 120 minutes of my life wasted, steer well away from this garbage. Minus 1 for false advertising in trailer, minus 1 for obnoxious and annoying special effects, minus 1 for pointless fantasy scenes as filler, minus 1 for too frequent transitions between story and fantasy, minus 1 for hard to follow story (due to fantasy scenes), minus 1 for lack of story depth, minus 1 for lack of character development in both main story and fantasy scenes, minus 1 for poor story and script writing overall. Final score: 2/10",

I dont understand how they start off in a mental institution and then suddenly BAM their in a type of 1950's whore house.  The ending is what really made me not like this movie. It made me feel depressed and confused when i left the theater. (SPOILERS) They kill Vanessa Hudgens character ( who is finally free from high school musical) Then they kill Jamie Chung's character.  Then the remaining girls try to escape but the main character cant. So the other girl leaves and then BAM were back in the mental institution. Overall Good acting and AWESOME action.

The action sequences are merely okay  with more lows than highs.  The director also can't make up his mind on what he wants the film to be.

Although the plot is simple, it questions the difference between main characters and character foil by the exposition of Sweet Pea as more than just a deuteragonist. The story is ultimately a reflection of Baby Doll's mentality, and thus creates the entire structure of the film based on what Zack Snyder wanted to portray about her character. Although a snapshot of a character's mentality may not be the most dynamic of storylines, it is by no means a lesser narrative.

Now surprisingly this is where people express what makes the movie fail....but how? She's living a total nightmare of a life where her mom died,her step dad is a lying sneaky bastard(which is why he's a priest in her fantasy) her sister's dead because of her mistake and she's in a mental hospital scheduled for vegetation in 5 days.....so yeah I think I'd make up a world of my own to.

      "text": "SuckerPunch. Given the lingerie inspired army suits and the cutesy names of the characters, I would say it was targeted more at a male audience than to be an inspiring female power movie. However, on a whole, the movie entities merged together perfectly. It was crazy, no doubt about that and the alternate reality to dream world thing can leave a lot of people going, 'what...?'. Believe me, if you didn't get The Matrix you'd have a hard time getting this show as well. However, the movie itself was VERY well put together. I like to think that the main parts of a movie, the acting, the script, the score, the costumes, the set, the sound mixing, needs to all blend together to create the mood of the film. Many times I've watched a movie and loved the script but the costumes were off and didn't fit the period they were in or were just not realistic looking, Eragon left me feeling like that. At other times the concept of the show was well thought out, but the score was lacking. I believe the soundtrack of a movie should make you relive the whole movie over in your mind when you listen to it. One excellent example of that is the soundtrack for the movie How To Train Your Dragon. From start to finish just by listening to the tracks and the sequencing that they were placed in made me feel like I was watching the movie all over again. SuckerPunch had that! Every aspect of the movie was in tune with the other to create the mood that the director wanted to bring out of the movie. And for that I give it a 10. I especially liked the scores, the remixed version of Queen's We Will rock You and Bjork's Army of Me. Classic. As for the story line, the motivational aspect didn't add up with the sexy army ladies for some reason with me. What the hell, they can't kick ass, and kick ass they did, in normal army clothes. I know it was a direct representation of how the girls saw themselves, reflecting their own personalities in the dream world or rather how Baby saw them but at the end of the day, we know it was all the directors decision, he could have very well put them in different army wear but he choose to have them not only kick ass but show some ass as well. That aside, I think the concept was good, the sound mixing and editing was excellent! Definitely have me for one of the best sound track's for the year! And it was NOT just entertainment. A person who's seriously paying attention can come away with the message but unfortunately it had enough fluff to obscure the films true intent for viewers who are just looking for entertainment. For the actors, Oscar Issac plays evil sooo well, I DIDN\"T KNOW HE COULD SING! My best performance went to Abbie Cornish who also happens to play my favourite character overall. No I'm not being biased, Baby Doll was also one of my favourites and Blondie gets best fighting costume from me. Hope I didn't spoil anything for anyone and despite my discrepancies, I still give the movie a 10 as I didn't see these discrepancies as being so off that it warranted a lower mark.   http://criticsmaylie.wordpress.com",

It is so easy to become entranced by the cute girls, stunning fantasy worlds, and huge explosions that minor things like plot and character hardly seem to matter.

Do the changes really matter?  Actually, yes they do.  The extended cut shows where Zack Snyder was really intending to go with the movie.  It also adds another layer of depth to the characters, adding more sense to Babydoll's lobotomy and other major plot points.  I'm not saying the original was a bat movie at all, it was incredibly enjoyable, but it lacked the \"sucker punch\" of emotion and revelation the audience was expecting.

However the middle of the film is such a disaster that the beginning and end cannot make up for the train-wreck that it amounts to.

It tries to be clever  it fails and just insults us with a nonsensical script. It tries to empower women into action figures  it fails and just makes them look like sex objects. Overall: I wouldn't be surprised if Zack Snyder secretly let his 14 year old crack-addled nephew direct this while he was off doing something else. The movie does have some good visuals that are jaw dropping and the girls are really hot, but the only way I think anyone could enjoy this is if they turn their brains off and let their genitals do all the thinking for the duration of the film.",

Like Inception and Pulp Fiction, you have to see it twice or even thrice in order to fully dominate your knowledge of it, but this is also the reason why it's getting so mauled by critics. They seem to not like a complicated film nowadays. But I personally found it very captivating. Third Factor, the acting is the weakest point here. It is not bad but it isn't a powerhouse it could be. Fourth Factor, the visual effects and action sequences are top notch and high class constructed. It is badass. I am very disappointed this movie did not grab and Oscar nom for Best Visual Effects, Best Costume Design, Best Sound Editing and Mixing. It truly deserved it. And the Fifth Factor: THE SOUNDTRACK WAS BEAUTIFUL. HANDS DOWN, the BEST album of 2011! The movie overall came to a seven. It's great but could do better in some small aspects.",

After accidentally killing her little sister Baby Doll (Emily Browning) her evil step-dad (Gerard Plunkett) puts her into a mental institution where they force their patients into prostitution. Taught by the dance instructor Madam Gorski (Carlo Gugino) to retreat into her fantasies, Baby Doll is encouraged to a pursue a gift for a hypnotic dance, whisking her away to a series of war zones searching for 5 items that she needs to escape the institution and get away from the villainous caretaker of the institution Blue (played by Academy-Award winner Oscar Issac). Envisioning herself as a whore, she teams up with broken women alongside, Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish), Rocket (Jena Malone), Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens), and Amber (Jamie Chung from \"Dragonball: Evolution\"), to escape before her time with the mysterious High Roller doctor (John Hamm) arrives.

The problem with these commercial films is that their whole purpose is to make money out of amateur movie goers rather than make something that should critically make sense.",

But personally, I thought the film had a great concept but it was complicated and that caused many viewers to not be able to fully grasp the idea. I understood the direction, but of course it could\u2019ve been executed better. Overall, I enjoyed this fantasy spectacle.",
