      "text": "Easily one of the best films of 2011. The opening 5 minutes of Drive are simply extraordinary: zero music and virtually no dialogue, just the Driver outrunning the cops after a burglary. If you aren't instantly drawn in by the opening chase sequence, your favorite movie is most likely Transformers and you do not deserve to see the greatness this film beholds. This raw and realistic film is falsely advertised by its trailers; they make it seem like a hardcore action flick, but it turns out to be an intensely character driven story with very minimal, but effective, dialogue that progresses the story at a continuously entertaining pace. The cinematography is some of the best I've seen in years: it seems effortlessly smooth and endlessly creative. The plot is simple, but Refn's execution is, in part, what makes the film ultimately stand out. Another crucial part to what makes this film so enticing is its ruthless depiction of violence. I KNOW that some (actually, a lot of) people are turned away, or dislike, Drive solely because of its graphic violence. These people are dumb; IT'S A MOVIE (not real). The violence is as realistic as it gets, without being over-exaggerated to the point of blood spraying 10 feet into the air in all directions when someone gets stabbed. There ARE some very graphic scenes, but I feel that it's a reflection of the characters (especially Albert Brook's and Ryan Gosling's characters). Most of the film is actually absent of action/violence, in which i was pleasantly surprised by. It's probably a 75/25 split. Overall, if you have any appreciation of good film, you definitely need to see this film. It's amazing and should win a handful of Oscars.",

      "text": "At its most basic level, Drive could be described as \"The Transporter with a brain\". If you yourself possess even half a brain, you'll realise that it is so much more. Drive is a beautiful, thematically rich and powerful film. The whole cast are superb, with Ryan Gosling imbuing The Driver with a deep, brooding emotion, and making him a very engaging protagonist despite him being a character of very few words. It's a true testament to Gosling's skill as an actor that he can communicate to the viewer so much about what his character is thinking through a single facial expression, or physical act. The Driver is also the epitome of cool, from his scorpion-emblazoned white jacket, sunglasses and Clint Eastwood-esque toothpick, to the leather driving gloves he dons and the unassuming analogue watch he fastens to his steering wheel when on a job. Carey Mulligan is also extremely believable as single mother Irene, and has great chemistry with Gosling. It is because this central relationship, this unlikely romance works that The Driver gains much of its emotional leverage, and with the addition of a surprisingly effective soundtrack of soppy electro-pop love songs, the few moments of intimacy that The Driver and Irene share, and the ultimate tragedy of their story, is all the more affecting. Bryan Cranston is brilliant as always as the crippled garage owner and low-level mob dealer Shannon, Ron Perlman is entertaining as Jewish mob heavy Nino and Albert Brooks is simply terrifying as Bernie Rose, the psychotic razor-wielding mob boss who serves as the film's primary antagonist. The film is about fractured identity, and about redemption through good deeds. This never more clear than through the characterisation of The Driver. He remains nameless throughout the film, only referred to in relation to his profession - he is a functional tool before he is a person. It is only through his steadily growing love for Irene and her young son Benicio, and through his quest for justice in punishing the Los Angeles criminal underworld that he finds his humanity, and symbolically saves his soul, proving himself to be a real person. Building on these philosophically heavy themes, Hossein Amini's script is deceptively simple, but effective - he gives his characters enough to say to communicate their feelings and map their growth over the course of the film, but pleasingly he doesn't fall into the trap of convoluted, inherently unrealistic dialogue purely designed to show audiences how clever the film is. These are real people, speaking (or not, in The Driver's case) as real people do, and the film's heady themes speak for themselves, and Amini knows this, and smartly doesn't resort to highlighting them in his dialogue, which would have made it heavy and laborious, rather than honest and minimalistic as it is. Drive is not just an achievement for clever writing, but also a visual triumph. Cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel uses his experience working frequently with Bryan Singer extremely effectively here - like in X-Men or Valkyrie, he is demanded in Drive to adapt his filming style to a number of visually and tonally different sequences - whether it's an expansive aerial shot of the glittering L.A. skyline, or a frantic car chase, or a more mellow and intimate moment in Irene's apartment, Sigel always rises to the challenge and creates something visually striking. The cinematography, married with Matthew Newman's masterful editing and the effectively moody film noir lighting used throughout the film, Driver becomes a real thing of beauty. Nicholas Winding Refn continues to prove his talent as an extremely creative, intelligent director that isn't afraid to challenge his audience. He's also extremely adept at handling action, without reducing himself to mainstream drudgery - the car chases and shootouts are all entertaining, but aren't dumb and obvious, and have more in common with the work of Martin Scorsese than Michael Bay. Refn clearly knows that less is more, and is prepared to make you wait, to really rack up the tension before giving you a blood-soaked or tyre-smoke clouded payoff, and the set-pieces are far more powerful as a result. Drive is many things - a religious allegory, an intense psychodrama, a tender love story, a gangster-thriller, a film noir, and it even has much of the iconography and themes of a classic Western. It looks great, sounds great, is well-scripted, clever without being pretentious, packs a real emotional punch and is extremely well-acted, particularly by the mesmerising Gosling. Simply put, Drive is stunning.",

He was totally outraged at how bizzarely boring the whole film had been and I was utterly blown away by the fact that it was obvious someone had found a short story at some point before the first script was written and had tried to adapt it to a screenplay without realizing it was a total DOA mess.  The characters are dull, lifeless.  Ryan Goslings performance is lukewarm at best.  The soundtrack wasn't even memorable outside of one decent credit roller song at the end.  Though the action scenes are shot well, the rest of the film outside of those scenes just falls flat in terms of emotional conveyance.  The romance between the two main characters is unbelievable and creepy.  All of their scenes together are terribly awkward as well.  The main antagonists end up just being some old italian mob guys who just happen to be involved.  The plot is as shallow as they come and no elements seem to exist in \"Drive\" that would or could ever place it beyond or above completely mediocre.

The movie grabbed a hold of me immediately; the opening sequence in this movie is one of the greatest beginnings to any movie I've ever seen.  It's extremetly suspenseful, and you can feel the tension through the entire 15 minute scene.  This is the way a \"driving\" movie should be, not that cornball Fast Five bulls***.  Once this scene ends, the real story gets underway.  Ryan Gosling plays the \"Driver\".  As his character puts it, (and I'm paraphrasing), \"You have me for 5 minutes.  If anything happens in that 5 minutes I'm yours.  After that, I'm gone.  I don't carry a gun, I drive.\"  He's a VERY quiet character, and I have no doubt that the biggest reason people may not like this movie is because of this.  There are some long scenes with no action and very little dialogue.  It sounds odd on paper, but it works beautifully.  The director (Nicolas Winding Refn) does a terrific job of creating an atmosphere, or a mood to convey the emotion of the characters.  The actors do a great job of backing up his vision as well, as they can covery their emotions very well despite having limited lines to work with.  Most of these scenes happen immediately following the opening sequence, and helps introduce and develop the characters.  Gosling starts to fall for the girl next door and her young son.  He learns that her husband is in prison, but when he unexpectedly is released early, Gosling is silently devastated.  This may sound like a love movie, but s*** hits the fan when Gosling finds the husband bloodied and beaten by gangsters looking to collect protection money from him while he was in prison.  The husband confides that he won't do the job they want him to do, but is considering it because the gangsters have threatened that they'll come for his wife and son next time.  Gosling decides he will step in to be the getaway driver on the job, and from there on out the movie turns into a high octane thriller.  There is an insane amount of violence in the 2nd half of the movie, so this movie isn't for the squeamish.  I won't say much more, because it may ruin the experience.  That's essentially what this movie is.... an experience like nothing I've seen before.  When's the last time you've seen a suspense/drama/thriller/love/crime/driving movie with a bad a$$ 80's synth pop soundtrack?  That's right... never.  This movie is completely original, and I'll even go as far as to call it a classic.  This movie will hold up VERY well over time.  If you don't like it, go watch Fast Five or Transformers or Twilight, you cornballs.",

Several days later, I'm still reliving key scenes in my mind.  Bottom line, this movie does not wear its heart on its sleeve, and it falls decidedly outside the normal Hollywood formula; this stymies some viewers.

You hire him, and he's there for you completely for 5 minutes.  Anything a minute either side of that, and you are on your own.  What a setup!  There's not a lot of dialogue from Driver, but what there is is acted out so well and glues you to your seat.  The perfectly tuned soundtrack serves as another character in the film, helping to steer the action and heighten the emotion of the film.  I can't say that I've ever seen a movie quite like Drive before.  Sure, there are some similarities to other movies.  The soundtrack alone reminds me of something out of Michael Mann's earlier works.  But there's more here than even the pieces of homages to other times could possibly add up to make.  There's been discussion about the very 80's lipstick font chosen for the titles of the film.  I think this was done purposely, to evoke memories of another time.  Drive will transport you away from the everyday into a taut and tense emotional vehicle that will leave you wanting more by the time it all inevitably ends.  Highly recommended and not to be missed!

The style is slick, 80s like, the violence stylized, cool, heartless, surreal, like Ballard. Gosling is perfect. The performance channels McQueen. The screenplay also kills, like a Paul Schrader, revisiting the light sleeper. The chase scenes were amazing, like Bullitt or The 7UPs, blissfully free of CGI. Great techno soundtrac to boot.

I think of this as one of the most intense action films made in a good long time, but most can't seem to get past the meditative exposition at all, so much the relatively simple plot structure (which, again, completely baffles me: action movies have no dire need to be as needlessly convoluted as \"Transformers\" or the \"Star Wars\" prequels; everyone needs a little \"Die Hard\" sometimes). It's at the point where I think there's a mutual hatred of the movie based off of its unique direction and popularity with critics. To put it bluntly: if you believe that anyone whose review score is lower than three, you are sadly mistaken. The movie is directed extremely well -- it is a very clean, very tight action film that contrasts the quiet nature of the movie's dialogue with the EXTREME violence (and I do mean extreme -- this is Peckinpah violent).

From the very beginning you are seduced by it's sublime silence and then you simply strap yourself in and enjoy what proves to be a cool, compelling, low-key,smart and sophisticated film to the very end. Ryan Gosling is dazzling as Driver. It's almost effortless from Gosling in what is his finest performance to date, he oozed star quality in delivering such a calm yet intense display whilst managing to convey such authority. Carey Mulligan is charming in the role of Irene and portrays her role as the ordinary, sweet next neighbour with such an ease. The supporting class are also a credit to this film. Bryan Cranston (Breaking Bad)has always been a firm favourite and yet again he is ever dependable and despite not being in the film throughout he plays an integral role and is great in doing so, Ron Perlman (Hellboy) is also amongst the supporting cast aswell as a notable appearance by the gorgeous Christina Hendricks. The film in so unique and eligant but it's plot is simple. Driver is a stuntman, car mechanic - working for Shannon (Cranston) and 'Driver' getting clients from A to B but never works for the same person twice. However, when he runs into neighbour Irene (Mulligan) and her son Benicio, things quickly change for him. Eventually he meets her husband, Standard, upon his release from jail and after he is attacked he agrees to help him pay off his debts. The heist backfires and Standard is killed leading Driver to believe it was a set-up and as a result sets out to find those responsible whilst ensuring Irene and Benicio's safety. It's a film before it's time with a noir feeling depicted from the opening sequences and it certainly seems to take inspiration from the 80's/90's with the likes of Pulp Fiction and Risky Business elements relevant. The cinematography is excellent and showcases Nicolas Winding Refn's talents in abundance, its impressive work. 'Drive' has been criticized by some for the violence shown within the film however its not as severe as you may think, yes there's some gritty moments but its a more realistic depiction of events compared to what you see in other films. All in all, 'Drive' is an exhilarating experience and without doubt one of the must see movies of modern times, i've never enjoyed such a neat and stylish work of art, utterly unmissable!

Ryan Gosling plays a Hollywood stunt man, who moonlights as a getaway driver, in a story that is both eerily similar to and nothing like The Transporter. The driver in this film is just as picky and OCD as Jason Statham's character in the Transporter, but that's where the similarities end. After a nice opening, this film quickly turns into some noir love story, that really focuses more on the conflicted driver, than on anything else, making this one boring film. How can a film company be allowed to put out an action fueled trailer for a film like this, which is anything but exciting. The clever advertising devils got me again, but facts are facts, and no trailer or good looking star can hide the fact that this movie was terrible.",

He has some kind of a double personality, a secret life. At day he works as a stuntman in car racing films, during night he provides an aid for criminals that is worthy of applause: he is the transport in which the robbers escape; but the life to him seems empty. The driver will find a way of ending his emptiness by the path of love. And that is the gate for changing his life and a little bit of the world. Drive has some details of Martin Scorsese\u00c2\u00b4s filmography: first Ryan Gosling is like the new Robert DeNiro. Second, there are some sequences that seem to be from Scorsese, the attack in the parking zone, the magnificent scene of the elevator, the car crashing and the ending. Third the protagonist has the need of discover a new life. This picture has an amazing script and montage, the score A Real Hero contributes to the feeling that wants to provoke this film, but the crown is the strong performance of Ryan Gosling (maybe his best after Stay). Beside that this film will always be a shadow of Taxi Driver; I really recommend it, because it is a reinvention of the local hero.",

However, this is not a typical artsy-fartsy film.  It doesn't stop short by only providing the previously mentioned characteristics, it uses them as a foundation and builds upon them.  Ryan Gosling does a great job at playing a perplexing character that you are never quite sure of.  The gentle and caring nature conveyed by Gosling really makes you want to root for him as a hero(anti-hero), however, there is a explosive violence bottled in him that makes you step back and wonder how far he would/could really go.  These outbursts provide for some very intense scenes that quite memorable.  All of the supporting actors are great and play their roles well.  There's a definite \"cool\" factor to the movie that is just hard to explain, but get a hold of the soundtrack and cruise through town to it and you'll catch my drift - just don't break any laws! :)  There are some long pauses in dialogue between the Driver and the love interest, but I was not turned off by it and found it to actually be more convincing of that awkward true love moment than how others interpret it.  Also, if you don't know or understand the fable The Scorpion and the Frog, then you're might be missing the integral part of the story.  I actually was unaware of this fable, but I had a feeling that a key scene where the Driver mentions it had more meaning then was blatantly conveyed, so I looked it up afterwards.  I recommend reading the fable before seeing the movie as it summarizes the tortured nature of the Driver.  I almost wish they would have showed the fable in text at the very beginning of the movie.",

The two mob villains are ham-fisted and cliched to a point beyond parody.  The audience is given no reason to emotionally invest in the well-being of any characters.  There is not a germ of realism in the tacky, tv-movie script.  All of which could serve to reinforce the mythology, if that's what this movie is after, but the archetypes aren't strong enough, and the story arc not epic enough to sustain a myth.  And, to top it all off, amid all the clumsy writing and un-reality of the script, the filmmakers practically beg to be taken seriously with overlong dramatic pauses and hyper-graphic depictions of violence.

So be prepared(If you ever watch the movie), to see a bunch of scenes where the characters just stare at each other rather than actually talking to one another. Specifically Gosling's character and Mulligan's character. So there's not that much dialogue especially within the first 30 minutes. Even though I'm not a fan of arthouse movies, I loved this one. Though, the title and the way this is being marketed as is very misleading. I expected a movie with tons of action and cool car chasing scenes. That is not this movie. There's little action and really only two car chasing scenes. This movie focuses on the relationship between Gosling's character and Mulligan's character, for about the first hour. Then the last 40 minutes is just a lot of killing, a lot of the killings are graphic and extremely gory. The acting is terrific, the cast does a wonderful job but the two that stuck out the most were Gosling and Mulligan, surprisingly. They were both exceptional, and the chemistry between them was great. I just wish that they could have added another scene or two with Gosling's character and Irene(Mulligan) hanging out together or driving somewhere together to really make the relationship seem even more believable and stronger. I also wish that they would have given Gosling's character a name, he's only referred as \"Driver\" or \"The Driver.\" I can see why they did that, I suppose it's probably better that they didn't give him a name but it would have been nice of them to give us a name. I admit I was pretty skeptic when I first heard Gosling playing this type of role, he proved me wrong. I actually can't picture anyone else doing this role but him. He ended up replacing Hugh Jackman, that was probably the best decision ever. I could not picture Hugh Jackman pulling off this type of role the way Gosling did. The story is simple and it kind of annoys me that people are saying this movie sucks because there was hardly a story. Sometimes a movie with a simple story can turn out to be an amazing film based on how well it's told and done. Other times a movie with a simple story can turn out to be total crap(Transformers Revenge of The Fallen). I mean no one seemed to care how Avatar hardly had a story, hell I didn't even care and I liked it. I didn't mind the simple story here because the movie was done so well. It was nicely shot especially during the two car chasing scenes. I especially liked the first car chase scene because you never left the car, it was filmed inside the car the whole time so it was nice to feel like you were part of that experience. The soundtrack for this movie was amazing, if the soundtrack for this movie is not nominated for best score I'm going to be upset. I loved the nice 80's like retro songs. Each song fit perfectly with each scene, and set a nice tone throughout the movie. I especially loved the song \"A Real Hero\" by College. That song just fit so perfectly with Gosling's character and actually added some depth to his character. Though the ending might have been disappointing for some, I liked the way it ended, and let me tell you it's not your normal Clich\u00c3\u00a9d happy ending. It was actually very sad and different. People also seemed to complain about how awkward it was when Gosling and Mulligan stared at each other a lot without saying anything. I can see why people felt that way but it was really only awkward the first time they met and hung out together. Isn't that normal though? They both start to like each other but they're nervous so they stare, smile and laugh at each other. I think it added some realism to this movie. Another thing that seemed to bother people was that Gosling hardly said anything during the movie, especially when he was with Irene(Mulligan). This is true, but they purposely did that. He was originally suppose to talk a lot but they decided to cut away most of his lines, to make him seem more mysterious. I think it was a smart idea of them to do this, it fit well with the movie, and it gives you a chance to try and figure his character out yourself. What was his childhood like? What got him into driving? How did he learn to drive so well? Ect. There's really no wrong answers to those questions and I actually thought about this movie for about a week after I saw it, hell I'm still thinking about it. I think I went overboard with reviewing this movie, I could continue to go on forever talking about this movie and everything that I loved about it but I won't. People who disliked this movie are probably going to think I was on crack while I was watching it but this is a great movie.",

The movie doesn't go anywhere and doesn't say anything, and remains a \"style over substance\" effort. Unfortunately, even the style is confusing at best: the pink lipstick credits, the Casio synth sound, the cheesy \"Thunderdome\"-style power ballad... if this movie had been made in the 80s, it might have some B-movie credibility. As a movie made 20 years after the 80s ended, Drive feels bewildering and artificial. And that's not even to say anything about the degrading, absurd violence; you don't have to be \"faint of heart\" to be disgusted with the blood spillage in Drive.",

And yes, the first five minutes showed promise. But, for starters, I actually think Gosling did not work in this role; he's very charming and I think this is why people seem to have liked his character. But in reality, all we are given is a mono-syllabic killer; a dull, violent creep. Which is  FINE, that could work. Except, it's far from \"hero/lover/surrogate dad\" mantle that the film is also struggling to hoist on him. A very confused follow-through of what I assume was a pretty great book/initial idea for the film    What part did fans like best? The abandoned race car driver subplot that no seemed interested in anyway? The way that Gosling dons a mask for no practical reason to carry out one of his killings? When that other car shows up mid-robbery for no purpose? (oh, they were going to pull the double-cross on the side of the highway? Smart thinking). That Hendrick's role consists solely of getting slapped by our \"hero\" and then getting her head blown off? Did you like the gritty realism of Carey Mulligan's  90s-emo-pixie-girl-who-also-works-at-Denny's-and-has-a-husband-in-prison aesthetic?  It was so beautiful when the Gos turned that guy's head into mush in front of her, wasn't it?  Did you like how the characters (besides Gosling who, ooh! has a trademark toothpick! Cool!) explained who they were in tight, little speeches so we all knew where we stood? Albert Brooks's hands are \"dirty\" too! From all the violence he carries out as a mobster. Get it?! Oh wait, maybe you liked the soundtrack. Ah yes, you know when the chilled out blissful tune plays and the singer says: \"A real human being and a real hero,\". I just love stuff you don't have to think too much about, you know? (It would be like if in Top Gun, while \"Highway to the Danger Zone\" was playing,  Maverick and Goose were on an actual highway passing a sign that said \"Danger Zone, 20 miles away\") To like this movie is to be easily fooled or just playing it safe to stay on the right side of the prevailing critical response. And, don't worry, you are not alone if you read these response and started to feel like \"Maybe I didn't get it?\" But there is nothing to get.

So bad in fact, that the audience began moaning and groaning with pain (and laughter) at the incredibly bad downward spiral the film took after the initial terrific opening sequence.  The dialog was so dull and boring that I had to check to see if George Lucas penned it.  Slow, lifeless, and uninspired events were periodically interrupted by pointless and graphic violence.  I hated almost everything about this film, with the exception of Bryan Cranston!  My heart was breaking badly for him as an actor having to be associated with this bomb.  Ron Perlman and Albert Brooks should have their SAG cards taken from them.  If future actors want to learn how to NOT act like a gangster or thug they should retrieve this movie from the landfill and watch their pitiful performances.  The costumes were ridiculous (who dresses up that way to attend a function at a strip mall pizza place?) and the music was misguided...even the scripted pink font during the opening credits went awry (I know, I get it, an 80's reference, but why why why?).  The bizarre sequence of Gosling wearing a mask and chasing Nino into the sea needs to be placed in the Screenwriter's dictionary under \"what to do when you've run out of ideas, but still want to make your film ARTSY\".  PLEASE save yourself some time and money and skip this blunder.",

I had gone to see this with another person, at a little independent theater, and at one point thought about walking out.

      "text": "So I just came home from watching a late night screening of this film. First thing off the bat, there was almost no dialogue between the protagonist and central characters. Even the \"Bad Guys\" and side characters seemed to have more dialogue. In general there was barely any dialogue in the entire movie, as a matter of fact. Does that take away from movie? That is debatable. This film seems to portray crime in a very negative light, from my perspective. The beginning is mellow and shows the inherent goodwill of the protagonist \"Driver\", and his attempts to protect those he cares about. The film really did a good job creating the bonds between these characters - the driver, Irene and her son. Halfway through the movie, I was thinking \"Wow, they've set this up well. Here comes the action part.\" I was thinking that much like other thrillers like \"Taken\", the back story had been set up and the movie would become more fast-paced. After all, it's supposed to be an action movie. To my dismay, it was still slow, not much action but very gruesome. If you're looking for your standard popcorn action movie this is simply not it. The ending of this movie was sudden and left many loose ends. The movie had a message, but it wasn't much to end on. Secondly, the ending was very anti-climatic and dull. Overall, I found this movie entertaining. The soundtrack always seemed to fit in nicely, the cinematography, and slow motion sequences were great. But, ultimately it left something to be desired. Left the theater with a mixed \"meh\" feeling. 6/10",

Instead he meets \"the girl\" 5 minutes into the movie and soon we see him playing \"temporary step dad\" to her son.

In sum, the story is not well developed...period.  I suspect the \"art lovers\" giving this movie high ratings are the type who like to go to art galleries to see paintings with random splotches.

But there are some major logical problems with the story (e.g., organized crime bosses who are constantly unguarded and who do all their own dirty work or the main character, who is one step ahead of everybody until the end, when something happens that everyone but him knows is going to happen).  Those logical story issues aside, it is a highly stylized film that is really fun to watch.  Gosling is great in the movie, and there are great supporting performances by Albert Brooks and Carrie Mulligan.

Firstly, throughout the movie it was apparent that the director was attempting to create a quasi-80's film feel; from the pink cursive font (Dirty Dancing, Risky Business) to the intermittently permeating synthetic music, to the formulaic and overly used montage scenes. Refn's use of these cliched devices contributed to a consistent tone of awkwardness and banality.    Secondly, from the cinematographic style, to the multiple metaphors and motifs, to the utilization of silence as a recurring theme, to the character development; all felt forced into the film and thoughtlessly used. It is clear that Refn understood that all of these cinematic elements were necessary for a powerful film, and yet used them too frequently and without subtlety.    Lastly, while it seems that Refn often attempted to emphasize silence and characterize through plain dialogue, it often left many scenes feeling unnecessary and artificial.    I understand what ideas Refn might have been attempting to convey by directing Drive, but instead of providing insight into the human condition, he ended up making a movie that was chaotic and which appeared messy on many levels. Perhaps Refn was inspired to put too much into one feature length film, or perhaps he just could not decide what kind of movie he wanted to make, but Drive  turned out to be unsubtle, fragmented, and lacking the necessary flow to allow the viewer to achieve the necessary; suspension of disbelief.",

That means that there is dislike - enmity,  for America, Israel, and of course Jews. Keep in mind that the intellectuals in France, at the Cannes film festival, gave Drive a standing ovation. That is why, for example, there are two conspicuous Jews in the movie. And those Jews manifest every false negative stereotype that  Nazi propaganda could come up with. There was no legitimate reason for this in the movie. It was just a cheap gratuitous attempt at Jew bashing. Similarly, all of the characters have a dark side, although they are much more nuanced and human than the two Jews, who are devoid of humanity in this film. There is some laughable concept of cool that these European intellectuals aspire to, including apparently the director and the writer of the screenplay. But however hard they may try, those responsible for Drive did not create a cool movie: Rather a boring, empty, meandering series of images, that never coalesce into anything worthwhile, or exciting. As for the critics that rave about this movie, they are so far out of touch with the average American that they might as well be in Europe, where they too can pretend to be intellectuals out of touch with reality.",

      "text": "A Clippers home game, a job; no problem, because the driver is one of those Dirty Harry types, somebody who compartmentalizes his pleasure from business, just like Clint Eastwood in the 1971 film, where the detective grabs a quick bite to eat at a hamburger joint across from the bank he knows is being robbed. Callahan notices the smoke exhaust fumes coming out of the parked car; he may even see the cigarette butts and matches outside the driver's side window collecting on the pavement, left behind by the chain-smoking autoist. The man at the wheel is nervous. The thieves should have hired a professional, a driver so cool and collected, he can follow a basketball game, first via television in the darkness of his hotel room, then on the radio in the darkness of the streets, before and after the robbery, not even minding that the second man emerging from the building is late. He's unflappable, this driver, with a demeanor that suggests Steve McQueen(in \"Bullitt\"), going so far as turning up the volume on the game, eclipsing the police radio in loudness, with the fuzz in hot pursuit. It's an affectation of nonchalance that recalls Harry finishing his hot dog while attending to the crime in progress. A bank-robbing outfit is only as good as its driver, and the specialist for these black stick-up men puts their getaway car on its side, but not before he hits the flower stand and a fire hydrant. Crossing the street, still chewing, with his M29 drawn, Harry then delivers that immortal speech to the felon, words that could only exist in the movies. \"I know what you're thinking. Did he fire only six shots or only five?\" As it turns out, the driver's interest in the fortunes of the L.A. Clippers is ostensible; he doesn't care one bit about how many shots the basketball team fired, but only that the game finishes before he turns into the Staples Center's parking garage, where he and his clients can disappear in the throng of hoop fans returning to their cars. Nevertheless, the sequence is pure cinema, too easy; too according to plan, all because of that pesky \"the\" attached to the protagonist's name, who at this point, is still an archetype. Played by Ryan Gosling, Driver(the \"the\" is implied through pastiche) evokes a mute Ryan O'Neal in \"The Driver\". The next day, we see the driver in uniform, but no, he's not a cop, but a stuntman for the movies, so in a sense, the driver is actually McQueen's double in the Peter Yates film; it's life imitating art, since a stuntman as opposed to a regular person(or an actor) stands a better chance of surviving a high-speed chase without injury. Like \"To Live and Die in L.A.\", \"Drive\" has in common with the William Freidkin film, a starving artist who dabbles in fakery. A Secret Service agent, on the trail of a failed painter-turned counterfeiter, burns an unsold canvas with his lighter, whereas the driver, a counterfeit actor, no longer burns rubber just for the cameras, but also in his personal life, where he is now the protagonist of his own crime story. Gosling is paying homage to his seventies-era forerunner, but then there's a diverging point, a vanishing point for the \"the\" in the character's name. The archetypal driver in the 1978 film, leaves both corresponding females alone, since neither The Player, nor The Connection, are called The Lover. Because of his asexual nature, The Driver never comes across as a real person. When O'Neal's character shows up at the apartment, he doesn't register that the hired allibi(for a casino heist) is beautiful. The woman takes no offense; she's sexless too. The Player just wants to collect her money. Their professionalism feels false, however, when you consider the genre involved: film noir, so the lack of sexual tension between them has a dislocating effect, since the man can't truly be hard-boiled without a hard-on, and the woman, act the part of femme fatale, in the presence of such flaccidity. Casey Mulligan, who is not The Prison Wife, nor The Mother, nor The Waitress, but a combination of all these facets that makes her Irene, puts the driver's preposition on notice the moment when these apartment neighbors share an elevator. The preposition gets eradicated for good in the supermarket parking lot, where Irene's car is on the fritz. \"Where should I put this?\" Driver asks, about the groceries(read: his thing) that he carries into her flat. Sadly, Irene has a husband in prison, so the real answer is a moot point. When he returns home, Irene becomes an accidental femme fatale, because Driver becomes a byproduct(not merely a replicant) of the exploitation cinema template, therefore prone to death. Every femme fatale has a hidden motive, and here, it exists on the level of narrative; she kills the sports movie, when Driver chooses to help Standard rob a pawn shop, rather than be a racecar driver. Nothing goes according to plan, of course, since there's no \"the\" in driver.",

Sure, the acting was good (big thumbs up for Ryan Gosling, I was impressed by his performance), the 70 's - 80 's music was cool and the cinematography was excellent. It's the kind of movie were all the snobby critics will give it a high score. Also, there were a few violent scenes, which were surprisingly bloody and brutal. I think that everybody should give it a try. If you don't get art house films, then you will really hate this. I only saw the movie once, but if I see it again, I will probably like it more. I think it's better a second viewing, because after seeing this, I left with nothing and I wasn't sure what I saw. The thing that bothers me the most is the people who liked this movie are getting overprotective and start to insult others by telling them that they don't know cinema, that they should watch '' Transformers '' instead, blah blah blah. Not everybody in the world will like this movie, it's impossible. Everybody was their own opinion. I'm giving it a 6, because while watching this movie I got a great feeling for some reason, yes i'm a little bit disappointed, yes most of the parts were boring,  but everything is well done (the acting, etc). Has for the drama, it was a success.",

Drive ranks right up there with the likes of Alien and The Crow in the category of 'movies that should have been bad but are somehow unbelievably great'.",

      "text": "The lure of this film is the magical prowess of a man who can drive a car with such skill that he is a like a Roman charioteer whipping his horses and ferociously advancing into a battle. But instead of horses, Ryan Gosling has horsepower, and in spite of the brutal cinematic violence, this film has turned Ryan Gosling into a first-class superstar and sex symbol. He plays this character with understated perfection--he is calm, unflappable, and fiercely focused; he is a predator who is ready to swoop down on his enemies, and he never carries a gun. He just drives. But in spite of the fact that he is gainfully employed as both a garage mechanic and a Hollywood stuntman, Gosling's character is inexplicably attracted to the dark underworld of crime, and he has a third job as a getaway driver.    The violent crime scenes are almost too hard to watch, and except for the opening scene and one later scene, the police are strangely absent as the driver or the \"kid\" goes on a killing rampage to protect the woman he has accidentally fallen in love with. He becomes more murderous than the most hardened mobsters, and their underestimation of who he is and what he can do means that they are doomed. But as perfect as Gosling is in this role, the film goes awry with an overload of violence that leads the viewer nowhere. The ending is inconclusive, leaving many loose ends that can never be tied up and failing to deliver a philosophy or a clear finale. Like the kid, this film just wants to drive. Nowhere. But it's great to watch Ryan Gosling in brilliant control of this vehicle.",

The man has very little dialogue, but with a simple look and nod we know everything we need to about him. Yeah, we'll start there. The movie rests on Gosling. He makes for a compelling \"Mad Max\" sort of character where he's soft spoken, but piss him off and he's a man capable of extreme violence. Albert Brooks is also terrific against type as a stone cold gangster. But really what made me love this movie was its unique style. I've never seen anything like it. The music was refreshingly unique and the way the movie shifts from a gentle calm to an extreme level of brutality is a work of art and frankly, it's sheer movie making magic.

Brian Cranston from the incredible Breaking Bad series does his part as a likable character, but as with the rest of the characters seems underdeveloped.

Unfortunately, it didn't lived up to the raves & praises that the critics gave the film. 1st off is Ryan Gosling's character, a very dull, soul less shell of a human being. Who's only real talent in life, is to stunt drive at high velocity. He's a Hollywood movie stunt man by day & a heist wheel man by night. His connection to these world is his \"mentor.\" (played by Breaking Bad's Bryan Cranston) One day Ryan Gosling meets his next door neighbor (played by Carey Mulligan) who he immediately falls in love with. Little did he know, this little lady was married & her husband was gonna arrive home from prison within a week. When the husband arrives, things seem to dull out again & go back to normal. Until one night when Ryan was pulling into his garage, to go home after work. He see's his neighbor's husband on the floor bleeding profoundly from the beating he received, from the two guys walking towards their car. It turns out, his neighbor's hubby owed the mob 20,000 large, they also threatened to kill his wife & kid if he (the husband) didn't rob a pawn shop by Friday. So, because Ryan Gosling was in love with his neighbor, he agreed to help him (the husband) with the heist. The plot is pretty thin, not too mention the film is very, very slow. The action happens quite rapidly, when it happens. That it doesn't compensate at all, for the film's slow pace. Not to mention, the ending was a total let down.

Drive captivates you ab initio and doesn't even stop after the movie is finished. It makes you think about beguilement and the craziness of people and that gets exhibited radically explicit. But on the other hand the movie isn't specialized on character sketches or telling long rigmaroles, it only shows you what is absolutely necessary. Oscar nominations for cinematography, production design, score, original song and maybe also editing would have been just. And not to forget the acting, which is also great and absolutely fits the film. I personally love Drive and I can't find anything that disappoints me with this movie.",

      "text": "Conciseness is often a form of skill, and \"Drive\" is the epitome of that. Take a movie like the Godfather, cut it in half, make it more coherent and artistic and this is what you get. \"Drive\" is the greatest crime movie ever made, it hangs on the edge of presenting a story so black and white, yet contains elements conveying the complexity of the characters. Too much use of dialogue makes a film seem scripted, and an obviously structured piece of media, \"Drive\" removes those cliches, and in offering much less, gives so much more. The lack of speaking allows you to fill in the pieces using common sense as the characters are so empathetic and so human. The casting itself mirrors that of the dialogue, no A-list celebrities are used, but we see familiar talented faces; this gives us the same sense of distancing that the dialogue gave us, but just enough there's a previous connection built to help us relate. One could go on and on about the soundtrack as well, the best I've heard in almost any movie. While almost being an action movie, \"Drive\" busts out stunts and intense action scenes to change the pace, however it's not blatant mainstream action at all, violence is far and few between, but so hard hitting it makes your stomach queasy, reminding you of the brutality people can live in real life. The simplicity of the movie is its strongest quality; and it doesn't need to be marked as \"artsy\" or \"European\", \"Drive\" is a breath of fresh air being a like a basic painting that allows your imagination to interpret it your own way like true art does.",

The driving scenes wouldn't look out of place in a hollywood blockbuster and the physical scenes are brutally graphic with fantastic use of slow motion in each used to great effect. I felt the direction and the driver character are intertwined; very reserved for the most part then losing control for brief periods of time. The entire film is just great not needing to have constant exposition or explanation and simply having characters share a look instead.

It is an unabashedly entertaining thrill ride, free of pretensions. Refn displays an astonishing talent behind the camera. The way in which he executes violence is brilliant; the film features more than its fair share of noirish gore, both audaciously stylized and subdued. There is enough substance to match the style. Ryan Gosling, Carey Mulligan and Albert Brooks give high grade performances; Gosling proffers his character with a uniquely laconic charisma, Mulligan is softly poignant and Brooks is a chilling evocation of ruthless cunning and dastardly cowardice as the antagonist. Its storyline accomplishes being sleek and aloof, yet also quite involving; this is largely, in my opinion, down to the nostalgic feeling with which Refn instills proceedings, lending the film an eerily tender heart amid its thrills and gore.

The cinematography is absolutely beautiful as Winding-Refn shoots what is, in my opinion the best car chase of the last few years, as well as injecting every scene with extreme emotion and power through attention to the most minuscule details. Gosling soars as the Driver, and the rest of the cast turns in outstanding performances (Ron Perlman would stand out as the weak link but watching his enormous jaw is just too damn entertaining) It would be remiss not to mention the absolutely stellar soundtrack, Cliff Martinez (Drummer from the first red hot chili peppers album in 1981!) turns in a synthesized sonic landscape that fits the film perfectly. The film truly is art-house, and j30 has it right when he says most of these negative commentators would like it more if it was a hugh jackman action testosterone f***-fest. The film was marketed that way in the U.S which was unfortunate because most of America probably came out hoping to see Fast 6. sucks for them, because tehy simply missed the opportunity to appreciate the most beautiful piece of filmmaking this year, perhaps tree of life and dragon tattoo come close, but Drive beats both in my book.",

The opening 5 minutes of Drive are simply extraordinary: zero music and virtually no dialogue, just the Driver outrunning the cops after a burglary. If you aren't instantly drawn in by the opening chase sequence, your favorite movie is most likely Transformers and you do not deserve to see the greatness this film beholds. This raw and realistic film is falsely advertised by its trailers; they make it seem like a hardcore action flick, but it turns out to be an intensely character driven story with very minimal, but effective, dialogue that progresses the story at a continuously entertaining pace. The cinematography is some of the best I've seen in years: it seems effortlessly smooth and endlessly creative. The plot is simple, but Refn's execution is, in part, what makes the film ultimately stand out. Another crucial part to what makes this film so enticing is its ruthless depiction of violence. I KNOW that some (actually, a lot of) people are turned away, or dislike, Drive solely because of its graphic violence. These people are dumb; IT'S A MOVIE (not real). The violence is as realistic as it gets, without being over-exaggerated to the point of blood spraying 10 feet into the air in all directions when someone gets stabbed. There ARE some very graphic scenes, but I feel that it's a reflection of the characters (especially Albert Brook's and Ryan Gosling's characters). Most of the film is actually absent of action/violence, in which i was pleasantly surprised by. It's probably a 75/25 split. Overall, if you have any appreciation of good film, you definitely need to see this film. It's amazing and should win a handful of Oscars.",

But Drive is for people who can interpret emotions and the psychology of the events that are in front of them. For that reason, it is not a mainstream movie and ends up going beyond the average movie goer who read things on the surface.",

The qualms I found with the movie is that it didn't do anything spectacular or out of the ordinary, save for what makes it stand out amongst today's action movies: It wasn't very reliant upon special effects. The special effects that were there, such as the few scenes of violence and some of the car chase and cars flipping around, were done very realistically and had a definite feel of rawness that make it stand out amongst its peers. Again, as noted, it is a good film: Nothing GREAT and nothing to really write home about. The soundtrack has a very 80's feel to it despite the mise en scene implying that the film takes place in ~90's. There are much better movies, such as Collateral or Le Samourai, so check those out before this one.",

Ryan Gosling stars as the Driver, who does not seem to have a name. Tellingly he drives. He works as a Hollywood stuntman during the day, moonlighting as a getaway driver for various criminals.  Gosling's performance is anchored in the Driver's harsh reality; he deals with life and death situations on a routine basis with no real identity. He slowly opens up when he is getting to know his neighbor (Mulligan) and her son (Leos); he does not talk much, but is genuinely kind. Mulligan's husband (Isaac) returns home from prison and is soon threatened for owed protection money. The Driver decides to offer his help, which is when the film shifts from a slow-building character study to a pulse-pounding thriller. Also involved in the proceedings are Bryan Cranston as the Driver's mentor of sorts, and Albert Brooks and Ron Perlman as two mob bosses. Each actor breathes a unique life into his or her respective character. Most are given surprising amounts of depth. Nicolas Winding Refn's direction deserves praise as well; the film captivates in just about each and every scene. Though the meandering first half clashes with the abrupt ending, Drive ultimately manages to be a satisfying and thrilling experience.",

Scenes seemed like panes from a graphic novel at times. The major off-putting aspect of the film was the bizarre music selection. The tune for the main titles was promising, but during the times when the music swelled after that, I tended to get a bit confused. While it did create a strong emotional tag that was cashed in at the end, College's \"A Real Hero\" was just a weird musical choice for this flick's showcase song.

The first fifty minutes shows a grand amount of character development, and shows us the kind of person that Driver really is.

The film oozes style, the cinematography is beautiful, the soundtrack perfect and the minimal dialogue from the lead character adding to the intrigue and extremity of his violent outbursts. The scene n the elevator was one of the greatest I have ever seen in a film, a very subtle but powerful moment and in one minute encapsulated extremity of Ryan Gosling's character. This film is a lesson to all directors of how to cut out the crap, how a story can be told with out having to spoon feed it to the audience. If you loved Taxi Driver and Scarface then you will love this, I like how the director made a nod to those films without the film becoming clich\u00c3\u00a9d.",

He was a loner working the existential streets of his noirish nighttime city. But he had minimal interests in other human beings. Here is where Drive amps up the same story. Cue the Michael Mann film Thief, full of rain slicked streets and scumbag gangsters that out hero becomes involved with. Drive gives us the same scenario but jazzes it up with Alan Ladd's knight in shining armor. I like the pastiche and Refin's not totally out of his element in American, though his Danish film series Pusher has more life and humor in them. In The Driver, our hero just wants to test himself, ala Jef in Le Samourai, Melville's incredibly influential noir of the mid 60's . Drive's hero picks up where Ladd and Thief's James Cann left off. His attraction to a woman makes him willing to lose everything. Love will do that to our hero, but unlike  the brilliant Le Samourai, the film that broke the mold, Drive's hero's love is all too human. A nice romp through the nighttime streets and another look at a crime ridden film that is absolutely copless.",

If \"Drive\" came out in the 1980's, we would still be talking about it today. It would be sitting in our movie shelves next to our other favorite '80s action films, a fine spot next to \"Lethal Weapon\" or \"Die Hard.\" I can imagine a young Tom Cruise or maybe even Patrick Swazye as the lead, a driver who is a stuntman for movies by day and a getaway driver for robbers by night. I can see Mia Sara as the sweet, innocent girl who lives down the hall from the driver, and whom slowly becomes attracted to him. And I sure as hell could see someone like Jack Nicholson playing the mobster out for the Driver. That movie would be awesome, and yes we'd be talking about it today. Alas, \"Drive\" came out in 2011 and that's okay, we are all the richer for it. For the driver we got Ryan Gosling, for the love interest we got Cary Mulligan and for the mobster we got Albert Brooks. All three actors are honestly more than breath-taking, completely fascinating with all they are given to do. That '80s vibe gives this movie the extra boost of cool. It's got Grand Theft Auto:Vice City style lettering during the credits, it features music which sounds like British New Wave (THE best music of the year) and its style and tone is very appropriate.
