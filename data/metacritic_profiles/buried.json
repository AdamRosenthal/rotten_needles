      "text": "Paul Conroy(Ryan Reynolds) isn't dead, but the American is halfway there; he's buried; he's a goner, so for all intents and purposes, he's dead, as are all the phantasmagorical residents of St. Agnes Cemetery, the people who know Francis Phelan, the patron saint of drunkards from William Kennedy's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel \"Ironwood\". The washed-up major league ballplayer's loved ones conduct their lives in pine boxes, under the dirt, an imitation of life, his parents, his infant son, subterranean and regimented. They're zombies who became mixed-up angels, playing the role of guardian instead of brain-eater. It's a lifestyle that the American in Iraq has come to know; his life, suddenly interrupted, when insurgents bomb a convoy of trucks driven by apolitical truck drivers, like Paul, the \"lucky\" one, the survivor, who stops being a zombie, perhaps realizing, finally, that he's complicit in the war, soldier or not. Alone, but not alone, since the Blackberry his captors leave behind, allows Paul to call for help, and more importantly, give people the vicarious experience of being him, attributable to the wireless gadget's video recording and subsequent transmitting of the hostage \"tape\" into cyberspace. Being her, being Saskia(Johanna Ter Steege), it's what the killer in George Sluzier's \"Spoorloos\"(American title: \"The Vanishing\") promises Rex(Gene Berloets), if he just drinks the coffee spiked with sleeping pills. Released during the pre-Internet days of the late-eighties, when rotary phones were on the wane, but still in use, in which the limitations imposed by an analog-based technology would have made it harder for millions of people to \"share the exact same experience\"(translated from the Dutch), the tortured lover, bereft of the futuristic hypothetical that Saskia's final moments could turn up on YouTube, ends up drinking from the cup, and becomes a victim of YouDie. Rex is the only one who knows how she died. When the effects of the drugs wear off, he starts screaming, having neither the technological means(a cell phone), nor kung fu(the hands of \"The Bride\") to escape; he doesn't have a prayer, as \"Spoorloos\" ends on an unsettling note of unfathomable suffering. The moviegoer never gets comfortable with the idea of being buried alive. Brevity is the key. \"Buried\" overstays its welcome. Whereas(in \"Ironwood\") Francis' father \"smoked roots of grass\" and mother \"wove crosses from the dead dandelions and other deep-rooted weaves\" as they lay in their graves, likewise, a semblance of culture makes burial seem almost tolerable, in which the Blackberry slowly normalizes Paul's once-frantic predicament, as the film's extended running time(as opposed to \"Spoorloos\") allows the moviegoer to orientate himself with the extreme spatial dimensions. Knowing this, the filmmaker resorts to cheap tricks as a matter of readdressing Paul's dislocation, like the episode with the snake, and the episode with his mother, shameless manipulations both, of our phobias and heartstrings, respectively. \"Buried\" may be experimental in form, but the content is pure Hollywood, depicted in a filmic language that's minimalist, but it's minimalism by default, dictated by the confines, not by existentialism. Paul is always doing something; he never just lies there and contemplates his inevitable demise, as Rex does, when he simply whispers his lover's name. \"Buried\" could not have been made without the advent of the cell-phone. Just like contemporary life, a person who relies on on-line friends, a whole host of faces and disembodied voices, doesn't need to be in a coffin to be isolated. Similar to Joel Schumacher's \"Phone Booth\", this paean to the information age represents a passing of the torch, as our phone booths slowly turn into ruins, without lament, by us, or perhaps, even by Superman. \"Buried\" is a perfect expression of our love affair with technology, in which man and phone are entombed in a parasitic relationship.",

      "text": "A suffocatingly well executed idea which surprisingly has a lot more to offer than you might think. The film is just as the title leads you to believe, Ryan Reynolds wakes up one moment and realizes he's been buried alive! Reynolds plays Paul Conroy a truck driver who's been contracted to \"rebuild Iraq\" (of course after we've invaded and destroyed it). Awakening imprisoned Paul does what everyone would do, screams as loud as he can for help and tries and force his way out. However the obvious solutions prove to be futile so armed with a flashlight, a lighter and a Blackberry Paul must escape or be witness to his own one man funeral. Latter, we come to know the reason for Paul's imprisonment is that he's being held captive for the sum of one million dollars, which if not transfered to a certain bank account he will be left to die. Paul calls everyone he can think of including family friends, the government and his company to prevent him from dying five feet under the ground trapped in a box. What can Paul do to satisfy his kidnappers and who can he call to get him out!? We'll you're going to have to watch the movie to find out. This film never leaves the box which is an amazing feat for a film. It stays underground and doesn't leave for surreal dream or fantasy moments like 127 Hours, which in my mind makes it a better film. Now you can debate this for hours on end but for me, putting the parameters of \"We are going to make a film about someone being trapped, and we are never going to cheat by leaving the space of the character\" is something to be praised for if done correctly. Buried delivers a story that few would try to attempt and manages to not only keep your audience interested in suspense but also brings up some very controversial topics about government, power and truth. The sound design in this film is amazing and the variety of shots this film pulls off with such a small space should make all cinematographers take notes. Ryan's performance is pitch perfect as you see his character ride a roller coaster of emotions of panicked, hopeful, and defeated. Even though you may hate the sound of this movie, that is exactly why you must see it. *spoiler alert If not for the ending this film would have only gotten a 7/10. But the ending has a twist at the end (which i didn't see coming) that packs a wallop of truth down your throat. For making the strong choice and not going hollywood I gotta give it another point. Well deserved.",

      "text": "A lot of people won't like this film for one simple reason: It is so easy to criticise and so easy to dislike, but the man in the box IS the film. There are no flashbacks, there is no filmed back story, nothing. The camera is not taken away from him at any given point. Knowing this, I was intrigued as to how the director could go about making this standard length film entertaining, but I was definitely not disappointed. Firstly, and there is no other way I can think to put this, the 'phantom claustrophobia' you are made to feel in this film is impressive. The acting is brilliant especially considering how difficult it must be to have no set to interact with, let alone any other actors to play off. So hats off to Mr Reynolds for that. The story is intense and realistic. Sure, there are probably some technical details that are debatable but on the whole, this film is firmly based in reality and as such is that much more interesting yet often difficult to watch. The plot is deceptively deep in the sense that the political issues it touches upon are both real and relevant and as such, you will find yourself wanting to scream at some of the characters (or voices of characters, should I say) in this film. I found it thought provoking and different, I'd recommend it to the vast majority of people. It definitely isn't a fast pacing action thriller so if that's your thing then you may struggle with sitting there for 90 minutes. For others, I will say that there are parts which are difficult to watch and it is quite a 'heavy' film for a number of reasons, so you do have to be in the mood for that sort of film if you want to enjoy it.",

What a total surprise, I mean I've heard mostly good things about this movie so I sort of expected a pretty decent film, but I was not expecting such a thrilling experience. First off, Ryan Reynolds is brilliant as Paul Conroy, he delivers the best performance of his career by far. He can act y'all! The performance is strikingly similar to James Franco's in 127 Hours, and in my opinion, it's as good. He completely surprised me with this film. Second, the writing is very sharp, emotional, intense, and effective; it truly adds to this film in many ways. Lastly, the direction and editing by director Rodrigo Cortes is absolutely fantastic! He did some very interesting shots from within the coffin that make this film not seem as claustrophobic as it really was. Yes, this film is nothing more than Ryan Reynolds trapped in a box, but at the same time it's so much more, so don't let that keep you from seeing this. Not only did I experience what Paul Conroy was feeling, but my mind was thinking and imagining what was happening outside the box. I really liked this brilliant little film and I cannot recommend it enough.",
