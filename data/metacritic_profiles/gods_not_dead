Atheists may not like it, but this is a very good representation of their aggression and anger towards Christians every day. It even goes as far as to prove the existence of the man named Jesus (whether or not someone is willing to believe that he is the son of God is another story). Yet, their responses to our faith are understandable, being as the existence of a God, and the right to believe in one stands in the way of their awful agendas.",

One actor (Jesse Metcalfe) even has his own Television show (Dallas) on network TV for crying out loud. The court cases listed in the credits have nothing to do with Christians being persecuted, but have everything to do with Christians doing the persecution. As for the choices made in the story, why on god's green Earth would a teacher need a public defender to defend her in a civil court? And why on great Zeus' Olympus would a teacher be in trouble for uttering the name Jesus? The court cases that have been mentioned in the end credits were examples of Christians doing the persecuting. The real message of the 'God's not Dead' franchise, I believe is this: \"If you don't allow me to persecute you, then you are persecuting me.\"",
