The story follows the growth and influence of the site thru its most significant releases and their consequences. Since it's directed by Bill Condon you can expect exceptional performances all around. Cumberbatch's creation of Assange is compelling and totally believable. Toss in lots of cool locations, interesting cinematography, edgy music and cool graphic treatments. The pace never lags and actually manages to build some tension. This films offers an interesting background packaged into a well-made, engaging upload.",

As a film, it's quite mediocre.  The worst part, in fact the single part I could point to in suggesting that you all stay away in droves is this:  The film visually depicts some sort of virtual office space that Assange and Berg inhabit in parts of the movie dealing with some of their online interactions.  It's something so hokey in 2013 that I'm more or less in disbelief that the director tried it.",

With a cast that strong, Condon manages to spread the focus around without the viewer necessarily noticing (or complaining about) the very real real fact that things are being spread wide, because there is little depth to offer when it comes to the central two players: Berg and Assange. In the end, The Fifth Estate is best suited as exploratory viewing for anyone looking to get a crash-course overview on what all the WikiLeaks fuss was about. Then again, it would probably be faster to just look it up on Wikipedia. Go figure.",

For sure the beginning is slow, then after a while it picks itself backup, then it just flows back and forth. It almost felt like the director didn't know which direction to take this movie. Maybe he was too distracted from his days on working the final two \"Twilight\" movies. I don't know. Benedict Cumberbatch is really good as Julian Assange and so is Daniel Bruel, but they just don't have enough potentially to help save this movie, which was kind of sad. Overall, it's a movie that has a continuous mixed flow.",
