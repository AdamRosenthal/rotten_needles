I have to agree that the ending is a bit \"I don't think it would be this way\", but hey the rest was  as I said  pretty decent.

Jim Baxford (Dominic Purcell) is a normal, hard working, family man, until his wife gets sick. Through a series of hardships Jim and his family go bankrupt, leading to an unspeakable act, that causes Jim to lose control. This film had all the makings of a terrific action movie, but that's not what we got. For over an hour, we watch the story of Jim's life slowly pass us by. What should have taken 25 minutes, takes up almost the entirety of the film, it was absolutely ridiculous! We meet Jim and his family, see what the issues are, and then, nothing for quite a while. Prison Break's Dominic Purcell stars in this thing and he is one of the best young action stars they could have gotten to star in this movie. It just really drives me crazy to see how obtuse the writers of these films can be. The lead character was cast, almost to perfection, while at the same time, you have a relatively good story to build upon, yet the film goes nowhere! By the time anything actually happened here, I was already fed up and disinterested. Assault On Wall Street looked like it was going to be a can't miss action/thriller. Instead, bad directing and perfectionist writers just completely destroy everything they have going for them and deliver a film that eventually becomes unwatchable.",

      "text": "Assault on Wall Street is a good movie, not a great movie or a movie you'll want to watch again anytime soon, but it's a good movie. It's a revenge themed movie that works well for what it is. The set up involving a armored car security guard and his sick wife dealing with compounding medical bills that force them into a debt spiral they can't get out of touchs real life in America these days. The first half of the movie does a good job of setting up what makes Jim seek revenge. We're able to sympathize with Jim during these moments and see how he could come to this conclusion. The way it's acted though is another story, some of the actors in this film are a little surprising. Veteran actor Keith David has a role as an NYPD officer who's been in the vice grip of debt before, we also have Edward Furlong playing Jim's best friend and co-worker. Both of these actors do well in their roles and it's nice to see Edward trying to rebuild his acting career. The main character though, Jim, played by Dominc Purcell comes off as just above wooden. He seems like a great guy, but he would come off in real life as creepy, someone you would keep your guard up around. He delivers a fair performance, but I think someone else could of played the part just a little better. The second half of the movie is where it begins to hit the fan as Jim loses it and takes out his frustration and anger against those on Wall Street and for the most part these scenes are done quite well. The action is good and Uwe Boll doesn't shy away from showing some blood and gore. The ending is somewhat of a mixed bag for me, as I kinda agree with it, yet think it shouldn't have happened another way. Assault on Wall Street won't become a action classic, but it 's worth a watch, especially if you hate the **** on Wall Street.",
