One is really angry and heartbroken, the other is the \"flirty sister.\" Of course, the only reason we know this difference is because they make it a point to tell us that.  \"I need you to help me look after your flirty sister...\" said one character to the other sister.  \"Oh, she's the flirty sister, that's the difference\" I remember thinking to myself.  I can't for the life of me remember what the actual plot of the movie was, and I literally took my kids to see this movie about 3 hours ago.  It was bright and colorful, there were fairies and lots of songs, but the story was so bland that it couldn't even hold my kids' attention for the duration.  My youngest, who's three, took it upon herself to climb out of her booster seat and throw it down the next row in the theater out of boredom.  I really didn't think George Lucas could sink any lower than Jar Jar Banks or the forgettable story from Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, but this movie proved me wrong.  Of course, it was so forgettable it may not matter, as I've been referring to it as \"Strange Music\" all day.  By tomorrow, I might just be trying to remember what I did this afternoon, with no real answer.  I really hope I am that lucky.",

From what I gathered, Strange Magic has to do with these two sisters/lesbians?, some love potion that causes you to sing a lot, and a troll king. If there's any semblance of a coherent plot, it went way over my head. There seemed to be way too much going on at one time. The story cycle through three main characters at almost two minute intervals, and it got so aggravating that I just gave up trying to follow whatever was happening on screen. One thing I know for certain about Strange Magic is that it lives up to its title; it's strange. The background animation is about as good as you'd expect from a modern animated movie, but the character design is just unintentionally creepy. They look more like demented caricatures than cartoon characters. What makes this movie even more painful to watch is that a majority of the running time is dedicated to covering random pop and rock songs at the most unnecessary times. They cover just about everything: Lady Gaga, The Beatles, Beyonce, Whitney Houston, you name it. Strange Magic may provide a decent distraction for the youngest of moviegoers, but older viewers will just be annoyed by the ridiculous soundtrack and disturbing animation.",

      "text": "OK, what the **** have the critics been smoking? They must really have it in for George Lucas because this is to me the best American animated film of 2015 (and this year gave us Inside Out). I'm a guy and not even that big of a fan of musicals and I thought this film was beautiful, charming, uplifting, and funny (Bog's mom has some fantastic one-liners), with a good message to boot. It's an animated version of Moulin Rouge, and the way the characters go from talking to singing and back again is seamless and perfect. The characters' actions seem realistic and believable in this world and I loved how the filmmakers played with a sense of scale, where even a flower is a huge in their world. Again, I'm a straight adult male and I don't normally care about fairies but this film made full use of the concept. This is sure to be remembered as a cult classic down the line. One of my favorite childhood films was Beauty and the Beast and I can compare this favorably to that. If I ever have a daughter, this will be one of the films I show them.",
