The majority of the scenes involve Witherspoon by herself so if you didn\u2019t like Gravity because the film centered on Sandra Bullock then you may not like this flick either.  The movie is based on the true story of Cheryl Strayed, a woman unable to cope with her own life.  Weighed down with frustration and grief from the death of her sweet, but white trash, mother (Laura Dern) and unable to connect emotionally with her nice guy husband Paul (Thomas Sadoski), her only release comes from engaging in some seriously self-destructive behavior.  But, Paul ultimately her leaves her for her infidelities and she realizes that she\u2019s no longer in control (not that she ever was) and that she\u2019s allowed her life to spiral down dangerously close to the edge of the abyss.  She tries cut-rate psycho-therapy for about 5 minute before giving up.  When the therapist asks why she does the things she does, she responds by saying, the only time life doesn\u2019t hurt like sh*t is when I\u2019m fuc*ing someone or shooting up.  As an act of desperation, and despite the fact that she has no backpacking experience, she leaves home (Minneapolis) to hike the 1,100 mile Pacific Crest Trail - which runs from the Mojave Desert in California to Washington State - by herself.  The movie is about her trek.  The movie has a grittiness and real-life feel to it.  The only odd moment occurs in the closing scene where, despite the fact that the journey proves to be her salvation, Cheryl tries to embrace her past rather than renounce it and claims that she doesn\u2019t seek or need forgiveness or redemption.  It\u2019s a prideful \u201cbroken but unbowed\u201d final speech, which I found interesting given that her survival appears to be founded as much on luck and the kindness of strangers as it is on her own inner strength.  But, despite Cheryl\u2019s lack of humility, you still feel good that she makes it through both the Pacific wilderness and her own personal wilderness and through to other side.  Stay and watch the credits for some interesting photographs of the real Cheryl.",

Another thing is that as time goes by Cheryl finds out what she is capable of. So it's a journey of redemption and self-discovery. Reese Whiterspoon has a great performance on leading role as an anti-hero that puts a stop on her life and decides to start all over; here lays an enormous courage that not everyone can afford, because it implies admitting that you were wrong from de beginning.

The switches were so quick (and at times unnecessary) that they muddle the timeline and the plot.

The thing that makes this film average is that she doesn't really look like she accomplishes/gains anything, and that makes it a kind of dissatisfying watch. For this i would give it a bad score but instead i'm giving it an average score as i find some of the direction in it very well done and i enjoyed the support roles too. Conparing this to \"Into the Wild\", this one is to give a pass as there is no sense of her gaining or accomplishing anything, whereas in \"Into the Wild\" the guy in it (SPOILER FOR INTO THE WILD) ends up dying and still seems to achieve and realise more.

But this wasn\u2019t just because of how immersive the cinema screen is and how it made me feel like I was experiencing Strayed\u2019s story first hand, but it was also how, using Strayed\u2019s hike as the guide leading us through the film, \u201cWild\u201d uses Strayed\u2019s internal monologue as a way of letting the audience see what led to Strayed to embark on such a terrific feat. This fluent style matches that of the book the film is based on, \u201cWild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail\u201d. It was also Witherspoon\u2019s performance that drew me in to the film, and by combining that with the inevitable landscape shots that are going to feature in a film like this, I suddenly realised that I had been walking beside Strayed/Witherspoon as the film had gone on.",

You just have to learn how to live life through all it's punches, keep an optimistic outlook, and remember that it will only get better from there. And always continue to chase that light at the end of the tunnel. For Cheryl Strayed, the light at the end of her tunnel just so happens to be a trail, the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT). The Pacific Crest Trail is a hiking trail that spans 2,650 miles from Mexico to Canada. With nothing but a backpack that looks like it weighs more than her, Cheryl Strayed finds herself hiking through the snow, heat, rain, and cold and at the end of the path was her light of self-discovery and self-repair.",

It's was very effective and the beautiful scenery added in to generate the flashbacks was genius. The cinematic effects were creative and added to the quality of the movie and made it even more enjoyable.  I have always liked Reese Witherspoon, but now see her in a new light as she gives her best performance of her life!!  Overall this is one of those movies that leaves you with something to take with you, once you are finished watching.  Top notch movie and one that I will watch again and again.",

The film is based on Cheryl Strayed\u2019s \u201cWild: From Lost to Found on the Pacific Crest Trail\u201d, a memoir of her 1,100-mile hike on the Pacific Crest Trail, and a best seller that topped many book club favourite lists in 2012, including The New York Times\u2019 and Oprah\u2019s. By the time the book was published, Pacific Standard (actress Reese Witherspoon\u2019s recently created film company) had optioned it for film rights. With Witherspoon already cast as lead actress, English legend Nick Hornby writing the screenplay and Dallas Buyers Club\u2019s Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e signed as director, Wild had all it needed to be a very interesting feature.",

Perhaps reading the original story of this woman's life would have made it much clearer, but the film sure didn't.",
