      "text": "Going into the latest Disney tent-pole, and the sequel to last summer\u2019s snooze fest (Even by kiddie fare standards), \u201cPlanes: Fire & Rescue\u201d I had my fair share of low, and I mean, low expectations. The trailers build this up to be one big sap fest, the first preview had the very good Spencer Lee singing the titular song \u201cStill I Fly\u201d. Which, yes makes it\u2019s way into a slow montage in the film. To be expected, the film is not in the high winds of what it\u2019s animation department is actually capable off. (Have you seen \u201cFrozen?\u201d) . Parents will find the film utterly predictable, but the younger children will more than likely be put in a trance, as soon as Dusty Crophopper swings into the big screen. To say the least I was truly surprised at how much I actually enjoyed this follow up sequel.",

      "text": "It was funny. Many jokes ranged from vehicle puns to a few dirty jokes that went over the children's heads. I never saw the first one, mostly because I was turned away from the aspect that it was just treading on the racing scene again. There was none of that in this film , and it provided a dilemma that the hero had to share responsibility for, as he still had a lot to learn what courage meant. The resolution was climatic, if not a bit too simple. I saw it in 3D, and it worked well with the valleys and trees and fires; it felt like Grand Canyon National Park. Overall, it was a good tribute to Fire Fighters who gave their lives and are continuing to protect civilians.",
