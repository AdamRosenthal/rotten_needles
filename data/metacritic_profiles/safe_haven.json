      "text": "A somewhat awkward romance flick, but it's sweet. Dialog is clumsy at times, side-characters aren't developed, and the more tense action moments near the end of the film fall flat. Still it is romantic and touching even though some moments come across as goofy and weird. If you're looking for a movie to watch with your significant other this is a pretty good choice. It may not always hit the mark but when it does it's easy to recommend to fans of this genre. Even as someone who doesn't really have a taste for this kind of thing I found it enjoyable.",

      "text": "A Nicholas Sparks adaptation unlike most of the others in that it can be at least at times a powerful film with actual characters and you know, purpose. When Katie (Julianne Hough) flees her hometown and takes refuge from her past in Southport she meets single father Alex (Josh Duhamel) and begins a passionate relationship while her past begins to catch up to her in the form of detective Tierney (David Lyons). Safe Haven is a decent love story that doesn't feel like the usual Nicholas Sparks drivel save for a final twist that almost derails the whole film. The film counts on Hough and she delivers a touching but hardened performance as a woman who has been through a brutal ordeal yet survived. Her isolation, while short lived is the main problem with the film thriving through character interaction, the time she spends alone drags and because of her secrets she prefers seclusion. Duhamel seems unsure in the role but has good chemistry with Hough so the overall feel is still there. The side characters are paper thin and take up valuable minutes of the film extending a picture with very little story. That's not to say its a simple film, in fact it tries to avoid being generic and formulaic although it only really avoids the latter. The film lacks anything special to make it unique so it comes across as ordinary. The director, having adapted Sparks' Dear John knows how to handle the melodrama rife in Sparks' books and in a way its what makes Safe Haven so light and easy to watch but it also means a film about trust, betrayal, death and fear is about as dark as an episode of the Tellytubbies. The film is so sweet at times its sickly and becomes nauseating. Overall the film is terrific in handling the characters and how they interact but it struggles and ultimately fails to surprise or impress upon the viewer any kind of originality.",

      "text": "Safe Haven was exactly what I expected. It was a good movie with an interesting plot, sad parts, and solid acting. Unfortunately it wasn't as good as Nicholas Sparks' best film, The Notebook. Julianne Hough is beautiful and a triple threat but her acting, while capable, wasn't as strong as Rachel McAdams. Josh Duhamel did a solid job opposite of Hough and seems to have more potential as a breakout star. As for the film, the plot was interesting but it dragged quite a bit and had some areas that were just silly. Honestly, the best thing about this movie was the subtle twist thrown in at the end. It changed the meaning of some of the elements of the film and left you with a better feeling for the movie in general. Overall this was an above-average chick flick but it didn't have enough of the thriller element I was hoping for from some of the trailers. Nonetheless, I'm sure most women will enjoy it and some guys, if they are willing to watch it, will probably enjoy it as well.",
