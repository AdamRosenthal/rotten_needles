Simply said, if this movie had a higher budget it would be one of the best. I think people who only like movies with very realistic graphics won't really appreciate it, but those who love a good story, lovable characters, and a simple but yet beautiful art design will love it.",

One look at the poster and I immediately thought, \"this ought to great if it has a poster like that!\" Then I saw the film, took one look at the designs of the characters and thought \"am I watching the wrong movie?\" I know some people may like it, but I personally found \"Battle for Terra\" to be an inferior animated effort. Beyond the ugly character models, the animation just isn't that great, you won't care for any of the characters after watching the film, the voice acting is passable at best, and the story just doesn't resonate. Even at a compact 90 minutes, \"Battle for Terra\" is only worth watching during \"Bad Movie Night.\" It's clear there was some effort put in here, but unfortunately, it's just not enough.",
