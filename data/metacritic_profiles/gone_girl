The problem with 'Gone Girl' the film is that it has been so faithfully adapted, too faithfully even, by Flynn herself that there are no surprises to be had. I acknowledge that this sounds churlish when there are so many book adaptations that are bad, but the lack of surprise unfortunately dulls the movie experience. The film is well cast. The setting feels right and the score sets an appropriate tone. However, David Fincher's unfussy direction does nothing to add an extra visual dimension to the story. As a result I felt somewhat disappointed by my own reaction, even whilst rationalising the reason for it. As already stated the actors are almost perfect fits for their roles. Ben Affleck is better than I had expected and really carries the film.

At really no point does it lag and while it is certainly very slow at times, it never becomes boring and leaves you hanging on the edge of your seat for much of it. Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike are stellar here, as are Neil Patrick Harris and (oddly) Tyler Perry. The cast, on paper, seemed odd, but in practice, David Fincher shows why he is one of the best around and got the best out of everybody. The general feel and mood of the film is also brilliant and entirely chilling. However, beyond the whole murder mystery type deal, the most interesting part to me here was the total indictment of the media and the 24 hour news cycle, which Fincher does a great job showcasing throughout and how the media will believe just about anything and then jump to conclusions based off of what small information they may have. The twists and turns here are also very interesting and the script from Gillian Flynn is very strong. The way the story was told at times was odd, but that would be my only complaint really and it was nothing major. As a whole, this is certanly not Fincher's best work (Seven, Fight Club, and Zodiac, would be my top three from him), but it is certainly not his worst (excluding Alien 3) and is overall, a very well made, well acted thriller that will leave you wanting more. Would be surprised if Affleck and Pike are not major contenders at the Oscars.",

First of all, the characters and their relationships are very well developed, establishing the moral of each one, representing their own stereotypes and then breaking them; second, the narration style is preserved, immersing the viewer in the game/conflict between Nick and Amy, creating a serious reflexion about how marriage changes people or how people change for their marriage; and third, the twists in the storyline that mess with your mind. David Fincher definitely was a great choice for directing this crime novel, and we see him in all its glory, such as Se7en or Fight Club. The problem is that Gone Girl is more than that, is a combination with a psychological thriller (characteristic more distinguishable in the book), and is here where Fincher fails; the torment and questioning that invades not only the protagonists, but also Go and Amy's parents, its not so clear in the film. Another huge problem is Ben Affleck, he makes Nick a static character, its impossible to empathize with him, though same parts of the movie requires it, others not. Nevertheless, Rosamund Pike is magnificent as Amy, which compensates everything.",

Fincher once again proved his class and his mastery in the thriller/crime genre and I am certainly looking forward to his next work. It is truly a dreadful decision of the Academy not to give Fincher and this movie at leas a nomination, but... well, those are the Oscars for you.

Watching this movie to completion is very similar to getting \"blue balls,\" for those of you who have experienced that scenario. You sit there, waiting, anticipating the epic plot twist that brings the story to its clever, dramatic conclusion. But instead, the movie just sort of... ends. All the unanswered questions remain unanswered. Additionally, new questions arise, such as \"Did the person who wrote this movie's storyline die halfway through writing?\" and \"How did over 800 people on this website get brainwashed into thinking this movie was complete?\" If you have not seen this film yet, I do not recommend it.

The premises of overwrought suspenseful machinery coupled with perspective flashbacks and, above all, a sardonic sense of humility within very clever and with great wit and verve human dialogue.

The film sets the same ominous and mysterious tone the book created so well. And of course, David Fincher's brilliant directing also made this film amazing.

Gone Girl is a treasure hunt that may have gone too long, and gotten too ahead of itself - but the overwhelming sense of dread and atmosphere is enough to tip me over to the other side. Rosamund Pike's performance is to the film as Ledger was to 'The Dark Knight', delivering the crisp, cold and sinister psychopath that takes a lot of the credit for pushing the story to its limits.

As I said this movie looks beautiful. The cinematography and lighting are both excellently done. The writing contains a surprising yet fitting amount of humor. The narrative unravels in an intelligent and unique manner. The acting in this film is top notch. Everyone in this movie was truly outstanding. Rosamund Pike is the standout performance here though. She absolutely becomes the character of Amy Dunne. She is on point with every single thing she does in the movie. Affleck's performance as Nick Dunne has to be touched upon as well. His character is very mysterious and unclear in his motives. His awkward personality causes people to become suspicious of him throughout the movie. This awkwardness is something that Affleck does excellently. This movie touches on themes of marriage, social norms, economic hardships, and the behavior of the media; all these themes are brilliantly intertwined throughout the movie's narrative.

The film also manages to be a very entertaining thriller that has you gripped from the first scene as our protagonist Nick, portrayed by Ben Affleck, tries to figure out what has happened to his wife Amy, played by Rosamund Pike who absolutely steals the show. Gone Girl is smart, slick and enthralling psychological thriller that i recommend everybody to watch.

She's so good that you might love Amy, even if she's not a very good girl as Amazing Amy is. The way she plays this character will eventually please you and make you like her. Affleck is fine but he completely vanishes because Pike steals the show. Besides, his performance never convinced me that Nick Dunne was capable of killing Amy so since the beginning I thought they were either planning something together or Amy was the responsable for everything that happens. Harris role is not very well adapted too but as a whole Fincher did a stunning piece of work, along with Fynn.",

Those who have read the book will be satisfied with this adaptation, as it stays almost completely true to the source material, and when it deviates from the book there is an intended purpose that elevates the movie even higher. No spoilers, but when the big secret is revealed, I like how it is revealed halfway rather than the end, because the viewer feels more connected to the story if we know what is really going on. The performances by Affleck, Pike, and even Neil Patrick Harris are all nuanced in the right way as they bring these characters to life. The movie deserves every second of its 141 minute runtime.",

In 2014, that film is Gone Girl, Gillian Flynn's adaptation of her own best-selling novel brought to the screen under the capable guidance of A-list director David Fincher. Fincher, who's no stranger to dark material (Seven and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo being examples), understands how to get the most out of Gone Girl and the result is 145 minutes of riveting drama and surprises. And, although the movie doesn't represent a page-by-page recreation of the book, it captures key aspects including multiple (sometimes unreliable) narrative perspectives, commentary on what \"guilt\" and \"popularity\" mean in today's media-saturated culture, and (of course) a Hitchcock-tilted storyline seeded with twists and turns.",
