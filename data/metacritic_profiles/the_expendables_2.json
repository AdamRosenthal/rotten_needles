On the other hand, Bruce Willis, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Chuck Norris have a little bit more than cameos, but they get to shine when they appear. Their presence is only there for the sake of fan service. Unfortunately, Jet Li gets thrown away of the movie out of nowhere and gets replaced with a Michelle Yeoh wannabe that tries too hard to be badass and fails miserably. Her role would have been better if it was played by Brigitte Nielsen, Sigourney Weaver, Linda Hamilton or Michelle Yeoh herself.

It did seem a bit rushed at the end, seemed to finish a bit too quickly, but the finale was still good for what it was and it wasn't disappointing in any way.  There are two new additions to the team in this one, and they both do a fine job.  One of the original Expendables goes on a 'side' mission part way through and doesn't show up again, but I think this was due to a scheduling conflict he had while the movie was being filmed, although I could be wrong.  So the producers used this angle as an excuse for him to not be in the rest of the film.  Overall, this was an enjoyable way to end the summer movie season and I hope there is at least one more mission left in these guys.  I recommend it to anyone who grew up with these actors when they were starring in their own films.  Even if you're younger than that, if you like action, you'll like this.",

There is too much of a disparity between parody and darkness here. And I don`t think it`s because of Chuck Norris. He actually made a good character and played well. Some of the lines are just silly and completely out of place. Also the action scenes are average at best, vastly inferior to the first Expendables. In the first movie, every kill had its place, here it is just chaos. One would think that with such cast and setting anyone could make a great killing movie, but here they failed. The director did not manage to use the image of every gun toting hero and certainly every one of them got much less than they deserved (Schwarzenegger and Willis for example). Also, the first sighting of the main villain (named Vilain, haha) seemed just right, but he turned out to be a total wimp in the end. For sure Van Damme also deserved to be bigger here. I must say that again, it is not the fault of all the actors who played great, but fault of the whole scenario. If one had given theme adequate action scenes then it would have been simply epic. There was faaaar too much of Statham, and his knive scenes are much inferior to martial art scenes of Jet Li from the first Expendables.  I sincerely hope the director will take notes on EX2, improve on the downsides and bring back some of the magic from the first movie. Everything else in this film is great so if you don`t mind lots of parody  then go ahead and watch it.",

However, this sequel did some things better and some things worse. Looking at the good side first, it did actually have a little big better plot development and believe it or not, even more action heroes. Adding Chuck Norris and Jean-Claude Van Damme to an already loaded cast and then having Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger each get more screen time were all plusses. All of the little inside jokes were absolutely hilarious, as well. The Arnie one-liners, Die Hard references and Chuck Norris jokes were fun little easter eggs for long time action fans. The problem is that this film somehow found a way to have even less character development than the first film, feeling somehow even more shallow. I actually really missed Mickey Rourke's character in this sequel. I thought he added so much to the first film in how he seemed to humanize the cast, especially Stallone's character. I suppose you could argue that Liam Hemsworth's character does that instead but I don't think there should necessarily be a limit on depth. And while those little nods to the 80's were funny, they actually took away from the seriousness of the film. Seeing Rambo, the Terminator, and John McClane all shooting bad guys side-by-side may have seemed awesome but there was simply too much of the over-the-top element in this movie. I felt the first film found the perfect balance between giving each action hero their due while staying true to making a great movie.

How much you enjoy all the CGI blood and flying bullets and goofy one-liners will probably depend on how much nostalgia you have for these guys-- though some things, like the charming rapport between Sylvester Stallone and Jason Statham, or Van Damme's scenery-chewing baddie, translate no matter how many times you've seen First Blood. And while the plot is once again dead simple, that's a good thing here, getting away from the convoluted political dealings of The Expendables and diving into straight-up evil. Van Damme plays a notorious Belgian arms dealer who has unlocked a cache of plutonium buried in an old Russian mine. He's kidnapping local villagers and working them to death to get at it, but even worse, he's killed someone the Expendables cared about to get there. Clearly, they must stop him.  The Expendables 2 isn't nearly clever enough to operate as an actual action movie as well as a parody of one-- maybe they'll hire Edgar Wright to write the third one and seriously up their game-- but it is a good amount of fun, especially for those going in for the nostalgic thrills they've been promised. Maybe they're all geniuses for lowering the bar so much with The Expendables that we can't help but be grateful to this one for actually being a good time.",

      "text": "Sylvester Stallone had a brilliant idea that came to fruition in 2010, with an action movie that brought together all the big names in the action movie genre, but there was a problem. You just can't fit every big name into one movie and give them all significant screen time, so you had to have a sequel. The more things change, the more they stay the same, however, as this time, the story was a bit better, at least for an action movie, and the cast was a bit younger, but the basic genre was still the same. Barney Ross's (Sylvester Stallone) team is once again brought together to do a job, this time there are some new younger faces, to complete what seems like what should be an easy job, what they weren't expecting was to stumble right into the middle of a madman's master-plan. As I said, the story wasn't as basic this time, things were a little more complex, but on a basic level this is still you're typical shoot em up action film, with bodies and explosions constantly coming at you. What I did like was how they change things up a bit and didn't just feature the same actors, even though many members of the team were the same. The one thing the first film was severely lacking was youth, and I don't know about you, but I'd much rather see Liam Hemsworth fighting with his shirt off than Sylvester Stallone. All in all, the sequel doesn't differ that much from the original, but where it does, only helps the series. The cast is younger, the story is better, and the action hits harder. If you're an action junkie, it doesn't get more exciting than the Expendables and the sequel will have you craving a trilogy.",
