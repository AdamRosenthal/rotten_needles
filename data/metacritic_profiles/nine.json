The women each in their own way deliver the goods it's the goods they are asked to deliver that are questionable, and not so much the goods as to the way in which they are asked to deliver them.  Cruz, Coitllard and Loren are excellent within their limitations.  Kidman  is quite good as is Dench and Fergie.  Only Kate Hudson seems lost in the shuffle and in many respects just wasn't needed.
