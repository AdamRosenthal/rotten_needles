Mr Farrell may have had good fun being the \"bad guy\"  but Ms Collette is clearly here for her name as she has a very small meaningless part. There are a couple of attractive women (a fetching girlfriend and crying stripper) but also with little dialogue, although our hero does need a sweetheart to encourage him. Mr Yelchin plays it for real, although there are a few laughs, it tries to be a serious film. He is believable and does have some unusual facial expressions, but overall he is average.

With Lisa's help, they come of age, where the \"monster\" corrupts Gary and Wyatt, who gawk nervously at the buck naked sex goddess, unsure of how one goes about losing their virginity. Conversely, or so it seems, Charley appears all raring to bust his cherry, hers too. Amy, his girlfriend, whom he has on the floor in the opening scene, the two going at it hot and heavy, in which Charley reappropriates the televised monster flick as background noise, the coverage they need to absorb the impassioned cries of their potential lovemaking. As usually is the case, judging by Charley's incensed reaction, the girl puts a halt to their amorous doings from going any further, leaving him, once again, with, presumably, blue balls. But how blue are those balls, in actuality? This time, Amy agrees with Charlie's protestations, and makes herself available on his bed, just what he was, only moments ago, clamoring for. The moment passes. Now his attention is drawn to the neighbors next-door, carrying a coffin, like life imitating art(or an outward projection of his cinephilia), yet what could be more important to a young man than life imitating a porno. Some moments don't pass. \"Premature Burial\", like all films made during the Production Code era, was virtually free of sex and nudity. Why would a red-blooded male teen want to watch that? It should come as no surprise, then, that Charlie would rather stare out the window than ogle a half-naked nubile, since unlike other guys his age, the titillation factor in catching a glimpse of breast before the homicidal maniac stabs his sexually active sister to death(from \"Halloween\"), holds no interest for him. On a subtextual level, the coffin is not what enraptures Charlie; it's the prospect that the two men are lovers. Drawn to them, on another night when Amy isn't around, he goes outside to investigate, spying on his neighbors from behind the bushes. When Mrs. Brewster call out for her son, she blows his cover(as both a voyeur and heterosexual), whereupon detection, Jerry rolls a half-eaten red apple towards Charlie, as if enticing him to take a bite(read: to sin). Exactly what does the slightly effeminate \"Evil\" mean, when he asks his friend, \"Did she find out how you really are?\" But nevertheless, Charlie has outgrown Ed, a latent fact which the new \"Fright Night\" brings to its inevitable fruition, accurately predicting that their friendship would have eventually dissolved had his the evil one not \"died\". Reaffirming his own masculinity, Charley equates vampire fixation with liking Stephanie Meyer novels, provoking Ed to respond: \"I'm seriously angry that you think I read 'Twilight',\" while they investigate the disappearance of a mutual confidant. But Charlie, in a shrewd move on the film's part, isn't a fan like his eighties counterpart, even though it's now socially acceptable to be into vampires...if you're a girl. \"Fright Night\" aims to remind people that these nocturnal creatures have more in common with the shark from \"Jaws\" than Edward Cullen. Vampires don't glitter prettily in the sun, they burst into flames. This time around, Jerry eats green apples, and doesn't share his forbidden fruit with Charlie. This time around, Charlie discovers vampires, then he ignores Amy. The gratuitous action that dominates the third act, smacks of overcompensation for a perceived feminine genre, mirroring Charlie's own exaggerated machismo by dating a sexpot. Could there be an even more incriminating photo on Ed's phone? More than a series of vampire murders, \"Fright Night\" is about a murdered friendship, two people who are in very different places in their lives, suggesting a prequel to \"Chuck & Buck\".",

So anyways, the new Fright Night was very entertaining and it's a lot o fun for putting old style of every vampire movies or horror films to bring back some memories, until we have to watch more romantic vampires of dullness, you know the Twilight series. Colin Farrell and David Tennant did perfect job as the characters that they look extremely cool. Farrell plays the villain who he wants to terrorize the neighborhood into vampires and he's very charm to others. Tennant plays Peter Vincent who learns everything about vampires does exist to teach the rules to kill vampires. The cast did pretty okay and do like the character who seeks that his next door is a vampire. The scenes are cool to watch and sometimes it could be handy to watch in 3D (but please see this in 2D better). The story was good and almost compare to the original that they have both compliment to the original to make it new. I enjoy so much and please check out the Twilight joke where Charley talks to the McLovin character if you know what I mean.",

It had the perfect suspense, the perfect dark ambiance and even the soundtrack was awesome. The only part they left was the '' scary ''. It won't make you scared to death (for those who like to be scared, you will be disappointed), it just has a few '' jump up '' moments and some stressful scenes. Some vampire fans may appreciate the fact that it has the rules, like the vampire can come in to your house unless they are invited and the rest you already know.

The big difference between this version and the previous one, is that this is move fells more for a horror one, and can not recreate the atmosphere of the first film. The roles are reinvented and adapted to modern times, and to a different city (Las Vegas): Jerry Dandrige works well, but I think as Jerry Dandrige (the vampire) is not at the same level as Chris Sarandon in the classic movie, that was a better villain. The actors now, are usually better (the vampire slayer Peter Vincent, played by David Tennant is very good and funny in the role), but the film has another air, pulled into the action and horror genre (but ends up being a bit tedious) and have a end that gives the impression that the movie ended too soon. Still, it's a good entrainment as a movie, although lower than the original - My Score: 6.6 / 10.0",

Colin Farrell was absolutely fang-tastic as Jerry (the vampire) and seemed to be having the time of his life, all 400 years of them! Farrell was impressive to say the least after his phenominal performance in Horrible Bosses he steps up again and takes it up another notch. The plot is simple, Charley Brewster (Anton Yelchin) a  teenager with everything going for him, hes popular, cool and ofcourse has the girl of his dream however when Charley's former best friend (Christopher Mintz-Plasse or McLovin to most) tries to convince him that his neighbour Jerry (Farrell) is a vampire his suspisions fall on deaf ears but very quickly Charley realises his former best friend has been right all along and as it turns out Jerry is thirsty! The film is actually pretty dark compared to the usual steroptypical films think Disturbia except with vampires and your on the right tracks. The suspense is brilliantly built throughout and combined with a more darker outset it really works well with this reboot although I have to say its far from scary. Sure there are a few moments that will make you jump but you won't be frightened enough to avoid going to your next neighbours door! All in all Fright Night is good, solid, well made movie. It makes vampires look evil again after all the Twilight outings.  Christopher Mintz-Plasse aka McLovin himself is great in albeit a small role and brings good charisma on his part but Farrell steals the show as he is dynamite throughout.

Well, maybe a LOT more. Let's start with the positive: The cast. Anton Yelchin, Colin Farrell and Toni Collette are all dynamic actors who should be able to really whip their scenes into shape. They almost succeed. Unfortunately, the actors' efforts are wasted by poor set pieces, bad pacing, lackluster attempts at humor, and bad directing. Even in a vampire spoof, the laughing should stop when the killing begins. Here, the vampire appearances are far from frightening - they are actually rather boring, and not gruesome at all. Las Vegas should be a great framework for a vampire story - here, we are just shown a small development outside of the strip which is not very spooky at all - it is rather cookie-cutter in its simplicity, which does nothing for the mood of the movie. David Tennant does what he can with the character of Peter Vincent, the great vampire killer - unfortunately, it simply is not enough. The angst he channels does not make its way off the screen, and adds very little to the plot of the movie. The CGI scenes are over-utilized and not at all frightening. Please see Fright Night for yourself - the original and the remake - and draw your own conclusions. Despite the addition of a slick, new atmosphere and popular actors, this movie falls flat - it is literally a pale ghost of the original.",

Farrel makes a great vampire - you can almost see him plotting how best to bring down his prey like a calculating predator, and Tennant's magician and vamp expert, while just a swearier, alcoholic, leather-clad version of The Doctor, is great for pure entertainment value. There may not be too much going on below the surface of Fright Night, but that hardly matters when the action, gore and self-referential humour is handled so well.

Colin Farrel did AWESOME! he really convinced me, and definitely looked the part ,nice job. Charley's character was a dick to Ed AKA \"Mclovin\" but he played a passable part honestly i think that part could have gone to anyone. Amy who is Charley's girlfriend also had a passable performance and could have been replaced easily! OVERALL the movie was good it served its Purpose. Not quite scary but definitely had its suspenseful moments. Some good humor in it also and some nice action scenes. Didn't care for the 3D! SO I'm giving this movie 9/10 some parts dragged a bit like the whole going to \"Vegas\" thing but its a great movie. I also compared this movie to \"Disturbia\" imagine Disturbia meets Vampires! REALLY UNDERRATED FILM. its actually sad that people would go watch a **** movie over THIS! if you're going to see a movie i highly suggest you watch this one! its definitely worth 12 or 15 bucks!.......",

What is new about Fright Night v 3 or FN 2011 as it were, is Colin Farrell. Farrell brings a much needed edginess and let's face it, a believable bad boy vibe to the franchise. Even better is the added bonus of Christopher Mintz-Plasse returning to his McLovin' roots by acting like a bamboozling buffoon. There is nothing more pleasurable than watching the clumsy geek-Ed Nelson (Mintz-Plasse) turn into the frightful vampire 'Evil' Ed Nelson.

To make it more effective, my parents turned out all the lights in the house, so all I could see was this disturbing glow of a bloodthirsty vampire tearing out someone's throat. Colin Farrell makes for a very effective vampire; (he was my favourite character) he didn't really scare me, he was more creepy than that. He certainly had the look and quality of a vampire. Remakes aren't normally as good as the original, but despite the normality, the acting, the dialogue, the atmosphere - it all creeped the hell out of me. This is also fantastically gory and the actors just passed swiftly under it, refusing to give in despite the fact that there was a vampire on the loose. Nothing like Twilight - as Ed described Jerry (cool name for a supernatural creature by the way) - he's the freaking shark from Jaws. In fact, this is very, very good quality. Would have liked it to have a higher score, but at least the reviews were mostly favourable. It just seemed a damn shame that I didn't see it when it came out, especially in 3D.

      "text": "I am not a fan of remakes, because rarely, if ever, do they do justice to the original film. That being said, I wasn't expecting anything out of the Fright Night remake, except for a cameo by Chris Sarandon. I was however pleasantly surprised, as the young cast was better than expected. For those who don't know the story, it is a classic vampire tale. Charley Brewster (Anton Yelchin) is a normal teenager, whose life revolves around High School and his beautiful girlfriend. Everything is perfect until an old friend tells him that his new neighbor is a vampire. At first Charley doesn't believe him, but the more he watches, the more he realizes that something isn't right. Anton Yelchin opposes Colin Farrell, and while he might not have the name recognition, he easily outshines the veteran actor. Yelchin has a cult following among fans of teen movies, after strong performance in films like Charlie Bartlett and Middle of Nowhere. As with most teen idols, his popularity is not just about his looks, it comes from his smooth relaxed style of acting, that people can relate to. Yelchin's characters are always real and honest, the kind of guy audiences can easily relate to, and that's what makes him as good as he is. Yelchin has help in this film from an all-star cast that includes, Farrell, Toni Collete, Christopher Mintz-Plasse-Mclovin, Dave Franco, and of course the original vampire, Chris Sarandon. The combination of chemistry between new and veteran make for a truly powerful cast, that bring new life to this classic story.",

In fact, he's so cool he's even dissing his best friend Ed (Christopher Mintz-Plasse). But trouble arrives when an intriguing stranger Jerry (Colin Farrell) moves in next door. He seems like a great guy at first, but there's something not quite right-and everyone, including Charlie's mom (Toni Collette), doesn't notice. After witnessing some very unusual activity, Charlie comes to an unmistakable conclusion: Jerry is a vampire preying on his neighborhood. Unable to convince anyone that he's telling the truth, Charlie has to find a way to get rid of the monster himself in this revamp of the comedy-horror classic.",

One flaw of the film that ruins it a little for me is Christopher Mintz-Plasse, IMO he was a terrible casting for the film and brings it down a bit. Also it ended in a very unsatisfying way. Besides that, Id tell others to give it a chance but thats about it.",

      "text": "Very enjoyable rehash of the original (which I haven't seen) sees Anton Yelchin submit a decent performance as the high school kid who is alerted to the nefarious antics of his vampiric neighbour (Colin Farrell). This has clever elements, attributing the Nevada locale as being the ideal, non-descript setting for a vampire to reside due to its propensity to attract people who 'work at night and sleep during the day'. David Tennant is exceedingly...funny as a supposed (but ultimately specious) 'vampire expert'  in a role that looks to have been written for Russell Brand. Christopher Mintz-Plasse also appears as a resentful, supernatural-obsessed, ill-fated ex-best friend of Yelchin. Fright Night is a very enjoyable, if not entirely groundbreaking, contemporary foray into the horror genre. 7.3/10.",
