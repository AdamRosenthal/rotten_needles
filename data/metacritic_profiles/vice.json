And then came The Prince, a boring, rubbish and badly acted thriller that he dropped last year. Now, the same director- Brian Miller brings us another anomaly of cars, explosions and cheesy acting in a low budget thriller. Willis just makes movies for pay checks now. Vice, okay, I totally lost the subject this movie is giving, because it's a remake of a classic thriller- Westworld, which was a million times better. But anyway, Story? There was a story? I got lost in the badly written script! There is Thomas Jane, at his ultimate worse, as a cop who wants shut down Bruce Willis's resort in which all crime is legal and you can do girls.. And stuff. Amber Childers doesn't know how to act because even if she did, the horrible plot, and writing will wither with her acting anyway. Bruce Willis is not even there, snippets of him are show for like 30 minutes. So really he is like an extra. It's just Jane and Childers throuought the movie. It's not even a Bruce Willis movie. A Goddamn bad one. There is a lot of stupendous action and violence throuought that could have lowered down to explain more. The climax is really nothing. Miller never explores his characters and the confusing climax falls. With a million dollar budget, Vice looks better than other low budget movies, but nothing more. It's like a project made by a group of teenagers and their handycam and their sick imagination of sex, crime and violence. Ignore Vice.",

I mean real people get shot just because some want to help robots or so called artificials who can be rebooted. Doesn't really make sense. Bruce Willis is there, but he doesn't bring anything to his movie. I wouldn't treat this as a movie where he is a main cast, as he actually appears only doing the same things over and over again basically. Story has many loops etc. Plus what I hated the most was how bad was the gun shooting, I mean not hitting anyone all the time, I get it that it's Hollywood but this was too unreallistic. I do not think that this is a complete waste of time as you can watch it if you don't have anything else to do and want to watch some action type of movie which at first seems a bit sci-fi but it really isn't.I can't give it a lower rating because I didn't feel like it's a complete garbage and it was watchable.",

I do like the 'Westworld' / 'Grand Theft Auto' nod, and if we had not seen countless other sci-fi movies that expanded upon the original concepts which gave us \"modern sci-fi,\" this movie might be a bit more appreciated.  I think the seemingly low production budget helped, since rather than portraying a billion dollar facility complete with holograms, white rooms, and marble toilets, the company in this movie looked like they were really trying to make a buck.  The BEST theme in this movie is wether or or not I should care about the \"replicants\" and wether or not I should care about this movie!  I appreciate it when movies don't \"explain\" things and just let them play out, and this movie pulls that off in some aspects, but also is guilty of one of the worst \"explanation scenes\" ever (I guess if you have not watched about 100 years worth of sci-fi over a period of about 40 years, you might need an explanation or two, though...).  Ever since working on a script or two, I have been unable to view movies without asking myself and others; \"Could you do better?\"  This movie is an anomoly that somehow pulled me through to the end.  If you step back from the thousands of actions scenes you have seen, and realize that people CAN be really bad shots in real life, the portrayal has a sense of reality.  Still really like Willis, still like Jane, and Childers is an amazingly beautiful woman.  If you are a sci-fi connoisseur, or interested in getting a few dos and don'ts for making movies, watch it.
