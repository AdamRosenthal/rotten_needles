If you have a fear of heights, as I do, there is a prolonged scene during the heist that will make you squirm in your seat!  Alan Alda always makes a good bad guy, as he first proved in a Woody Allen film years ago.  I thought the acting across the board was good, and the film was shot well.  The only part that didn't work so well for me was Gabourey Sidibe.  Her acting is OK, but her weird Jamaican accent comes and goes.  There was no reason for the accent so they shouldn't have added it.  Not a great film but good.  Recommended, especially if you like Eddie Murphy.",

Brett Ratner directing was good . No the awesome part , \"The Cast\" . No need to say anything about Ben , He is the best . Eddie \"Axel\" Murphy came back after a long time . This role remind me of his masterpiece Beverly Hills Cop (1,2) , it was good to see him again . Casey Affleck  remind me of his Oceans role .

Ted Griffin, the screenwriter, gave us an interesting, smart, and amusing script for the first 48 minutes...and then he went on vacation and his 10-year old son finished writing the rest of it!  It left me scratching my head wondering how dumb and incompetent all the characters suddenly became, and how stupid, dull, un-clever, and implausible the plot line became.  Mr. Griffin's uneven script felt as if he wrote it years before he wrote Ocean's Eleven...when he was still learning his craft.  O-11 was a far superior film, even though the two movies are similar in many ways.  This movie had SO much potential but it fell WAY too short of reaching the \"good flick\" status it was craving.  Ben Stiller and Eddie Murphy worked well together and complimented each others talents tremendously.  I only wish that Mr. Murphy was on the screen longer because the film was only a \"comedy\" when his character was present.",

This movie did surprise me though, aside from it's lame jokes, there is substance here, which include a pretty good story and an interesting cast. Ben Stiller is terrific as usual, but Eddie Murphy was not. I was never a big fan to begin with, but in recent years he has completely lost the ability to be funny and carry a film, the way he did with the Beverly Hills Cop series. Usually Murphy is an asset, injecting humor into an otherwise dry plot, but here his appearance actually takes away from the film. His character is both forced and uninteresting and I'd go as far as to say that this movie would have been better, if Eddie Murphy's character was just eliminated altogether. As I said earlier, the previews don't do this film justice and if you base what you're going to watch solely on previews, than you probably didn't see Tower Heist, and you're missing out. It is an interesting movie, that's different, and has a couple of twists in the story. Not an award winner by any means, but it's certainly something that will entertain you for a couple of hours.",

There may be one or two lines which you can look back fondly upon, but for the most part it's not hysterically memorable.  That being said, there really isn't much wrong with it either.  It's engaging, well cast, and amusing, so I'm giving it a light recommendation.  However, I'm not guaranteeing that you'll love it, so don't blame me if you feel like your time was wasted.",

The whole movie just gets more and more disappointing as you watch it and really has nothing to show for. It's boring, only occasionally funny, and rarely smart. Tower Heist is a failure, not a major failure, but it's easily forgettable.",

The comedy in the film is awesome and the place where the film was shot was incredible. I gave it 9 out of 10 because i wanted it to be taller.(just because i loved it.)",

Tower Heist can get confusing at times but the actors manage nail biting scenes and moments of action well. Everything feels balanced, not too over the top, not too risky. As a member of the audience, I was left wanting more. Overall, a very good action/comedy flick that lingers steps away from greatness.",
