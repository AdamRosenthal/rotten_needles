The story is dreary, and it stays realistically so to its credit.  I thought it would be a Leaving-Las-Vegas-Light, and it's not that, but it's rough. I'm glad I saw it, but wouldn't necessarily recommend it.  I definitely want to see W.F. in more serious roles in the future.",

So when comedians like Jim Carrey, Adam Sandler and, in this case, Will Ferrell, attempt drama, assuming the script is right, it should work, but it doesn't always turn out that way.  While the script to \"Everything Must Go\" isn't perfect, Will's performance is darn close.  He doesn't, at any point, try to morph into the Will we have come to know in his comedic roles.  The story is sad, depressing and real.  And Will plays the role perfectly.  I feel his sadness, depression, progression through the stages he's moving through as a result of enduring a lot in such a short time.  For a many who can command so much in his film roles, I truly hope he does more low-budget, well-written roles like this.  He's worth it.",

      "text": "There's no possibility that this film will be as effective and impactful in ten years or so, it's Everything Must Go's current relevance and immediate dramatic potential in the present economically uncertain world that makes it work so well. The plot structure has been seen many times before, and you can see the plot twists coming a mile off, but almost everything is done exceptionally. Performances are great across the board, with Will Ferrell proving he has the talent for comedy, tragedy and the in-between. Rebecca Hall is good as always, but everyone is put to shame by the young Christopher C.J. Wallace, who has great chemistry with Ferrell, and who is a real talent to watch in the future. Everything Must Go is expertly crafted, funny and engaging, wearing its old-fashionedness as a badge of honour and using it to its maximum potential as an archaic but symbolically effective modern take on a New Deal-era film. The way it promotes A Christmas Carol-worthy redemptive story arc and throws in some strong themes including depression, alcoholism and the evils of capitalism, it feels like a Frank Capra film for the modern era, and for that reason it's a joy to watch.",

Did the critics like it because Will Ferrel is a serious actor (story still sucks and is depressing) or they like depressing crap that goes absolutely no where.  They should call this A Pathetic Drunk Lives On His Lawn.  I can't feel sorry for Will Ferrel's character in this movie as he brings all the problems on himself.  It's not that he is wronged by anyone really.  He's a drunk who loses it all and wallows in self-pity for 2 hours.  I like movies that are either interesting or fun.  This is neither.   I'd rather have gone to work than sit through this waste of time.  Also when the critics say \"Will Ferrell at his best!\"  that is code for he is NOT funny or trying to be.  Like Adam Sandler in Punch Drunk Love ... blah ... don't get me started on that one.  Stay away from this if you like Will Ferrel as a comedy actor.",

      "text": "\"Everything Must Go\" has two things going for it that really make it a worthwhile movie experience. First, Will Ferrell gives the best performance of his career. Here, he doesn't rely on his trademark shouting or his random one liners to captivate us. Instead, he delivers a very low-key nuanced performance that gets us to care about his character's situation. Second, the script by Dan Rush is wonderfully honest. It carries the film along at a nice steady pace and every moment rings true. There's no manipulation here. Rush also does a nice job of keeping this seemingly simple premise interesting. He's able to pull back the layers of Ferrell's character and give us details about his situation at just the right time. Now we've seen elements of Ferrell's character in other movies. Because of this, \"Everything Must Go\" isn't the most engrossing of character studies. But Ferrell plays it so well that you can't help but get involved in his situation. If you're strictly a fan of Ferrell's comedies, avoid this one. But if you're a fan of Ferrell as an actor, you can't miss this. Ferrell proves that he's more than just a comedic actor. He can handle drama just as well and deliver something special.",
