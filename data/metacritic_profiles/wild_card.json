      "text": "This film is a bit more story-driven than your typical Statham flick, which is a roulette game of its own.  Story-driven Statham films have a tendency to flop, but not this one, given that it is a nearly word-for-word remake of Heat with Burt Reynolds.  You still get some great, well-choreographed fight scenes, and with a coherent storyline, I say this is a winner.  Statham movies are a category of their own, a category I enjoy immensely.  I would recommend this movie to any Statham fan.",
