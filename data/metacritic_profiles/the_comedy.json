No plot, no character development, no overcoming obstacles, and a main character the audience is likely to hate. Who would watch such a film? Would it even be considered a \"proper\" film, he wonders. \"No! What a terrible idea for a movie!\" everyone tells him and so, ultimately, Adaptation turns into your standard Hollywood movie, complete with car chases, gun fights, and people being eaten by alligators.",

The low critic reviews are a little suprising, but not so much when we consider Kaufman's tragically low rating of 67 for Synechdoche New York. Sometimes they get it wrong. Firstly, Heidecker's turn as the lead in a serious film was criminally passed over. Naturalistic, realistic acting appears to be becoming a thing of the past in mainstream film, so his portrayal in this is refreshing. The movie is not a comedy, but it is very funny in parts, thanks mainly to Tim's cruel deadpan and his chemistry with Eric Wareheim. It's a character study, and one that finally targets the apathy and emotional distance of aging 30 year olds who aren't willing or able to let go of their youth or play the 'game.'  Looking forward to seeing another film from the director, who has the potential of being a darker  harsher Noah Baumbach.",

The style of directing and acting complement one another so well and atmosphere and tone are just perfectly set. Anyone who has lived in either NYC or Los Angeles probably knows someone like Tim Heidecker's character, or at least one of his friends. I wanted so badly for whatever is good in this man to come bursting forth, even though you know it isn't going to happen because there isn't an ounce of authenticity in him... or is there? This character is a total enigma. I had no idea Heidecker was capable of this kind of nuanced performance. What a misunderstood treasure this film is.",
