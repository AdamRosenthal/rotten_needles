By the end I felt as if I had been on the journey with them and wasn't far off crazy myself. Swank and Jones are a good pairing with the latter providing some fitfully amusing moments. Swank is at her most outstanding in a very moving scene in which she asks Jones to marry her.",

Jones plays the shiftless reprobate who she enlists to help her on the strenuous trek. The story unfolds in small episodes that provide short glimpses into their characters and situations they face. It's a bleak time and the threats they face are continuous. The film's mood reflects this (although Jones manages to give his character a few comic flashes).

Same thing here, but it's the old West instead of being stranded on a planet with no one else. In this story, it's being stranded with a selfish person. Both movies show the extreme circumstances of loneliness which causes people to go crazy. I used to watch \"Streetcar Named Desire\" when I got depressed because after watching that movie, I knew my life was so much better, so I felt better after watching it. This movie doesn't offer the same relief. The ending of the movie seems to say that these women made poor choices when they decided to live in isolated areas with men they thought loved them, when the man's need was more out of necessity than love. Yet most women want love, even now. Golddiggers were not interested in the West and this movie shows why. thw story affects you. But I dont watch movies to see a depressing story. I have my life for that which can, but not always, be bad enough. I wanted the ending to have redemption, but it did not. I'm not sure what the end meant. I hope it means Biggs changed, but I don't think that happened,",

The cinematography is the best thing this western has going for it, as the shots here are truly gorgeous from beginning to end. The premise is interesting and well realized. Heck, even the characters are very well done and have nice little arcs to them. That said, the acting is spotty, the film is decidedly dull, and I typically avoid chalking up sexism as a con unless blatant, but the fact the film pretends to be feminist is what makes me do this. Ultimately, the film could use better pacing, but as it stands this one largely satisfied me.
