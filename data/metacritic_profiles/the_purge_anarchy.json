First off, the sound effects set on the movie were way too high... At one point a gun was placed on the counter and it sounded like a real gun went off in the theater.  It was unbearably loud.  I had to cover my ears during some gun scenes.  Oh and forget it... As soon as I saw a turret i knew my ears were abouta bleed.  Even covering my ears it sounded loud.  Second, the movie was extremely racist.  So what ALL wealthy families are white and  EVERYONE in the government is white??  Nah not a chance, even if its a majority white at least have the indecency to add a few other races so it doesn't seem like you are trying to be racist.  Adding onto racism, everyone in the NFFA  is black.....  Couldn't just add one white guy!?  The dialogue was poorly made.  They made Liz \"the girl with blonde hair\" such a typical dumb ****  Seriously who wears high heels on the day of the purge.  Also acting like such a **** when the Sergeant saved her and then wanted to continue without them.  She was screaming on top of her lungs to not leave them.  Like are you serious?! The guy saves you and wants to do something and you're going to act mad selfish and scream... attracting purgers...  Not to mention the scene in the end when the sergeant got shot and Eva and Cali(mother and daughter) ran out of the CAR to go to him and yell to the guy if he had a CAR!  YOU JUST CAME OUT OF A CAR WHY THE HELL YOU ASKING IF HE HAS A CAR IF THERE IS ONE 20 FEET AWAY!  The ONLY thing that was good in this movie was the Sergeant cause he was a badass, the rest of the actors/actresses were trash.  Awful movie, racist, the END.",

However, this one felt like they tried way too hard to make a deeper meaning and emotional connection. Firstly, the characters in this movie are AWFUL. I really, really disliked all of them. They aren't bad people, but they are very fake people. They try to seem sympathetic and take some moral high-road, but it just comes off as staged. I was really hoping about 20 minutes into the film that everyone would die. The \"twist\" to the movie is that the government is now killing people during the purge because citizens aren't doing a good enough job at controlling the population. Why a government would want population control was never elaborated on. Maybe they wanted to decrease their tax base?It's really obvious that this is what is going on from very early on. However, the makers of this movie think their audience is completely stupid and continually threw out \"hints\" about the twist and then in the very end let the government guy have a whole monologue explaining his devious plans. I actually laughed because I was like- DUH! Jeez. I am actually writing this review to try and get the attention of the people who are going to make The Purge 3. Dear whoever you are: if you want to have character development or a story about a specific character stick to one and don't try to give us equal half-stories about 20 of the characters. Also, no one thinks this should be a horror film. Inserting random scenes to make people jump is super lame. Stick to the good thing about this series and that is the premise and the crazy ways people think of to kill one another.",

It was written to appeal to 4th graders, and with all the violence and sickness in our world, this was the last pile of garbage that anyone needed to spread. This is coming from a 44 year old adult, whom of which loves a great action flick, and has no problem with violence if it is part of the story line. Sorry to tell you all....this was the most pathetic excuse for a movie that I have ever seen. respectfully, casho",

I really enjoyed the first Purge movie but out of the 5 \"lead\" characters, I was rooting for four of them to get their heads blown off so I didn't have to listen to the drivel they were spouting throughout the movie.  WAY to much is going on in this flick. There is the 5 main characters \"fighting\" to survive, the government conspiracy, and the underclass rebellion.  The rebellion story is so unnecessary and I knew that ultimately they would save the day for our characters. boring and predictable.  Why do these characters feel it is necessary to try to talk about moral issues as they are \"slinking\" through the streets trying to \"survive\".  Even tho the one enjoyable lead (the guy who was out to actually do some Purging) tells them to shut up repeatedly they blabber on endlessly trying to convince him to be a good guy making a lot of noise along the way giving away their location repeatedly to the bad guys.  The teen age daughter was SOOOO annoying.  Really disappointed in this sequel.  Hokey, bad dialogue, bad confusing plot.  But the worse sin overall was it was really really BORING",

      "text": "Having loved the first movie, despite it being rather stupid, I was really looking forward to the sequel when it came out summer of last year. It took me a year to finally get around to this, but I'm glad I did. The Purge: Anarchy is an action horror film and a sequel to 2013's The Purge. Both films take place in the near future where the US government sanctions an annual 12-hour period where all emergency services are suspended and all crime, including murder, is legal. While the premise itself is completely unrealistic and stupid, it is extremely interesting and original. The first Purge takes place in 2022 and only took place within one house that was being invaded by some purgers. It was a major letdown for some, but it was incredibly entertaining for me. The sequel takes place a year later and is really the Purge movie everyone had hoped for. It tells of five people who are simply trying to survive the night on the streets of LA during the Purge. The Purge: Anarchy rights most of the wrongs of the original Purge and doesn't mask itself by being a home invasion thriller or revenge flick. Anarchy is definitely its own unique movie. It does introduce some new ideas to the Purge story. It shows that not everyone purges just because they want to; some do it for revenge and some do it just to stay alive. The film also shows what the richest people would do. They hold auctions where poor people are auctioned off to upper-class purgers, and the scene showing this is probably the most interesting scene in the movie. Not only does The Purge: Anarchy show off some well-executed ideas, it's also an incredibly thrilling and entertaining movie from start to finish. What made this movie so fun to watch was that each character had their own unique struggles and reasons for being out in the Purge, and there was some great acting from the entire cast to make them even more interesting and real. The Purge: Anarchy proves a significant step up from the original film, and it's the perfect summer thriller film that I would recommend to almost anyone.",

I was expecting almost nothing from this since the first movie was so predictable and bad.  For having a cast of no names it really was an impressive movie.  If I had to compare this to anything it would be that this movie is what '28 Weeks Later' was to '28 Days Later'.  Much more action, several more characters, and best of all it wasn't completely predictable.  A good rental for action fans and gore hounds.",

      "text": "The Purge Anarchy captures the idea behind the Purge so much better than the first movie, which i would say is mediocre at best. Instead of keeping the film contained to one house like the first one did, it took us to the streets during purge night following 5 characters. Although I do have some problems with this movie I would say it is a massive improvement over the first one. The biggest problem I have with the movie is the pacing of action and the acting at times, which can be wooden and cringe worthy in places, the writing could have been better but it isn't horrible although I do think the writer completely missed the mark on the 'horror' genre here jump scares do not make a horror movie. in summery i would say if you have thought about watching The Purge Anarchy then it is a good action movie with some jump scares thrown in the mix.",

The movie follows three groups of individuals: a separating couple(Zach Gilford and Kiele Sanchez), a mother and daughter(Carmen Ejogo and Zoe Soul), and a heart-stricken father(Frank Grillo). Grillo is ready to purge and is out for vengeance when he stumbles across the other four characters needing rescue. He has to hold off on his mission to save this group of unfortunate people. They aren\u2019t only trying to survive the civilians purging, but another group is purging as well. The group of five is forced to trust one another on a night when no one can be trusted.",

The action part and suspense and all that was really good and the movie was exciting to watch throughout, plus this one was better than the first one, but anyway, some of the ideas or what happenned there at some parts felt so dumb or so unrealistic that it made it harder to watch it without laughing etc at some moments. Anyway, if you watched first one and thought it was ok, then you will like this one more and will actually enjoy it, if you hated the first one, then these Purge series are not for you. If you were not hating or liking first movie, then give this one a chance so that you know where you stand.",
