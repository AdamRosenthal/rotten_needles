I wish Shane all the best and this film really captures the turmoil he went through with his partner's death. I hope Tom's parents come to their senses one of these days and realize how shameful their actions pre and post-death were.",

It tells the story of Tom and Shane who genuinely come across as 'the perfect couple' only to have their idyll shattered by a tragic accident. The film traces the now all too familiar story that they, as gay men growing up, suffered at the hands of small town mentalities. Testimonies lovingly articulated by family and friends bear out that their six year relationship really was one that most people would aspire to. Events following the accident appallingly demonstrate how cruel and selfish the actions can be by the people who purport  to love us the most, our parents!",
