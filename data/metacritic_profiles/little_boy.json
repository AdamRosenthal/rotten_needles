I guess for most people they can't stand this message but it isn't surprising considering how racist our country is.  I'm not religious but the films portrayal of both faith and secular views are very respectful which is rare in film today. My family and I loved this film and it brought us all to tears.

The rest of the cast do their jobs admirably, though there is something very special in the interaction between Little Boy and Hashimoto, the Japanese stranger who moves into town.  Critics do not like the film because it has a strong \"Norman Rockwell\" \"Frank Capra\" air about it.   The priests are decent people. The mother of little boy is strong and holds the family together. The film does not shy away from the hatred and bigotry many held toward Japanese Americans during the war but confronts it with some real lessons for our times.  There is no glorification of war and the pain felt on the home front is very visible in the character development. Are some scenes predictable? Perhaps. Does the director telegraph some of his moves? Yes. But none of this affects the overall feel and charm of the film. David Henrie does a super job of having the older son bottling up and exploding until a critical moment. so I recommend the film strongly and urge viewers to judge for themselves who is right  - the critic or the ordinary guy.",

      "text": "Little Boy is charming and interesting and is a well-shot film overall the film has commonplace characters, a  terrible religious message, cliche's and it's offensive. The acting is okay, the actors give what is expected of them nothing special. An auto mechanic is sent James Busbee (Michael Rapaport) is sent to Japan to fight the Japanese during World War II, leaving his wife (Emily Watson) two sons London (David Henrie) Pepper (Jakob Salvati). Pepper feels upset without his father by his side, so he can't wait for him to return. His favorite magician Ben Eagle (Ben Chaplin) and priest (Tom Wilkinson) convince him to bring his dad home. The filmmakers want to make a story but they failed to make the story good overall they just made a silly mess. Grade B-",
