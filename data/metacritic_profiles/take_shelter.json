Showing incredible vulnerability, Shannon stars in this character study of a broken man dealing with some troubling visions that threaten not only himself, but his relationships, and his marriage. Shannon does a great job portraying this troubled man. The writing here is also very good and it does a great job drawing connections between the storms, both exterior and interior. Overall, I would say this film has many strengths, but none that make it a truly great film. As it stands, it is pretty good, but is missing that \"it\" factor. Its main negative is that it is a touch too long, even though it is two hours. Some scenes could have been cut and the final result would have been just as effective. However, as it stands, the film shows both the talents of Nichols and Shannon quite well and show is a pretty emotionally impactful film.",

The film echoes a sense of dread and anxiety, channeling Shannon's dark, slightly unhinged, sullen aura, his trademark loomy stature and coarse features; he brings to life a \"Curtis\" character who is so malleable in his purpose, that no one can tell what's to happen next. Moreover, it feels as if what the audience is seeing has much more depth, as if another layer of subtext is just waiting to show itself. Nichols paints a portrait that is both astounding and riveting to hold on to, grimmacing and shuddering uneasily with anticipation and pent-up apprehension, driven by self-discovery, and down-right frightening in the most eerie of feelings. Although it is Shannon that reels in arguably the best performance of his career, more than worthy of an Oscar nomination, Chastain is incidentally moving, though mostly captured in her spot-lighted contemplation and worry. Notwithstanding near impeccable casting, editing, musical accompaniment, and cinematography, not all will appreciate \"Take Shelter\" due to its slothlike pace, frustratingly ambiguous, conflicting religious and metaphysical themes and interpretations, and its crazed, schizophrenic sequences. Pack plenty of whitey-tighties, because this one's a nightmare.",

He takes drastic action to protect his family, so drastic that it threatens to rip his life apart. His wife thinks he's going crazy, even he thinks he might be going crazy. But he still continues on because he truly believes in what he's doing. I found this conflict fascinating, and the question that writer/director Jeff Nichols leaves us with is equally compelling. Is Curtis a paranoid schizophrenic or is he a prophet? The ending doesn't give you the answers you're looking for. This isn't the kind of film that's wrapped up in a nice tiny ribbon. It forces you to think. The performances are also terrific here. Michael Shannon really allows us to see the conflict brewing in Curtis. We can connect with his doubts as he makes decisions a sane person probably wouldn't make. Overall, this movie isn't for everybody.

Director Jeff Nichols keeps his film tense and disturbing all the way through. He lets the madness slowly start to come in until it kicks the door wide open with brutal force. The film is a true battle between reality and fantasy, and Nichols creates the perfect mixture of suspense, drama, and insanity to feed it. Take Shelter is a horror film unlike any other because it has nothing to do with monsters or ghosts. Instead this film allows a feeling of terror to overwhelm us that is familiar and much closer to home.",

As far as the acting, I didn't think that Michael Shannon's job was very difficult when I thought about it.  He usually just has a blank face.  Emotionless.  Who couldn't do that?  This is one of those movies that critic's like because it's a very different kind of movie.  Maybe if they would have turned around and seen have the audience sleeping it would have altered there final scores.  Only reason I gave it a 1 is because I did like a few of the camera shots.

I'll point out one element that seems dishonest and safe: having the daughter be hearing-impaired means that the filmmaker doesn't have to really give her a point of view.  That is dishonest because of course she has emotions.  She just sits like a sweet little cherub (and she is adorable).  But, she is given no room to react to the craziness around her.  Kids have personalities too.  Key scenes that show this:  We get to see some of her spunk when she is feeding the dog some of her own breakfast in the opening scene...but later when her father gives the dog away we get no reaction from anyone--not even a mention of it! That shows me the filmmaker wasn't really interested in the real emotions of the family members.  The whole film felt designed to get good reviews, but it felt very manipulative to me.",

Every 10 minutes this guy was having nightmares, and the only purpose of these dreams was apparently to scare the sh*t out of the audience.  By the third nightmare, I was over it.  Based on the spoilers I've read, apparently this crap just continues the entire length of the movie.  It's a 15 minute plot spread out for what feels like an eternity.
