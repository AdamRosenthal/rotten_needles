The film\u2019s script lacks any originality borrowing the loser becomes a hero story that tons of kids movies seem to use saddled with a generic love interest, generic villain, and tons of cardboard cut out characters. Outside of a charming Rover who despite some callbacks to Wall-e is the only charming character in the film with his lack of words and puppy like attitude. Unfortunately, the rest of the film isn\u2019t so charming as it constantly relies on pop culture references, mainly of other sci-fi movies, ranking in at one per minute. The young children who see this movie will probably find it ok although I pity the parents who will be wanting to get inside their car rocket and leave the planet.",

This is by no means the cream of the animated film crop, but it's a far better experience than many reviews to date would suggest, and it's worth watching.
