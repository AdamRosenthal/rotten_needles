Some people believe that all Christians think all films about God are great, but I think being a Christian actually makes me more critical of Biblical movies.  Son of God has some real emotion in it, and it's actually less preachy than many other faith based films.  That's not to say that the movie is sinless in cinematic terms.  The visual effects showing ancient Jerusalem couldn't get any cheesier in my opinion.  Even 14 year old Gladiator completely destroys the film on this front.  Of course, Gladiator had over 100 million in its budget, but I've seen free software create more believable visuals than seen in Son of God.  There are also a few clumsy moments in terms of storytelling, and it's really nothing new, but I think the film is good enough in terms of acting and directing to give a little boost to your faith if you're running low.

Obviously Christian audiences are going to enjoy it the most, even if it has some inconsistencies here and there that aren't entirely factual. Once again those who have something against God, Jesus, and religion and general are going to hate it. That's sort of my main problem with the movie. Even though it does a good job of telling the tale it does nothing to give those outside of the Christian faith a reason to care. It won't give them any reason to doubt themselves or make them wonder, which is something I believe a truly great telling of the story of Jesus (and religion in general) should do.",
