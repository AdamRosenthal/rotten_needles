Nathan Lane plays the drama coach/teacher who loves the play the ex-student has written and the efforts all make to have it produced. Greg Kinnear as the father of the young playwright also interjects his presence as this troubled film seeks to find its comedy/tragedy identity but never quite makes it. I give the film only a 6 despite the fine efforts of 3 very talented actors.",

She takes it upon herself to bring it to the stage (with the help of drama teacher, the always funny Nathan Lane). There are other supporting roles that add to the humorous momentum (notably the school administrators). This movie is as light and predictable as a TV episode and some of that could be the director, Craig Zisk, a talented veteran of the medium. Although it's in no way memorable, this is a sweet little trifle with charming comic energy.",
