Simple plot and character structure, yet provides some soulful insights into our relational needs as human beings, and the fear that often isolates us. Many Christians will find the film \"theologically challenged\" (and might be offended by some of the crude language), but it is not a film about man and God, but about human relationships, and the fullness we get from being together even when the world is a scary place.",
