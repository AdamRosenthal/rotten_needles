Same collection of overweight pathetic losers, same overt racial stereotypes (assuming Guidos are a race, which I believe technically they are.

It was believable, and well acted, but quite honestly, I just stopped caring about this guy or the film at a certain point and was really nonplussed when it was over. Disappointing because it had huge potential.",

      "text": "Even though the main character is written to be quite pathetic, I think it's easily relatable to everyone who has been disenchanted by one of their heroes, famous or otherwise.  That's why you root for him.  He's making obvious poor decisions but how easy is it really to make the right ones when the weight of the world is on your shoulders and every move matters?  This movie beautifully outlines a character badly in need of a victory in a world that has so few of them.  Detailed and original.  If you have no insight or need cover models in your movies so your up on the latest fashions then steer clear of this great film.",

He's a lonely man in his late thirties, living with his mother, making end's meet as a parking garage attendant where he spends his time either sulking at the loneliness of it all or jotting down notes while listening to the broadcast of the New York Giants game so that he can read them aloud on a radio show later that night. Yes, Paul is a \"big fan\" of the New York Giants, and his devotion is incorruptible, even when the unthinkable happens.",

      "text": "Big Fan is quite possibly one of the best sports films of all time, and it doesn't have a lick of football in it. It shows the life of Paul (Oswalt) as the self proclaimed biggest Giants fan there is. As he gets beaten by his favorite Giant Quantrell Bishop (Hamm) for unexpectedly witnessing a drug deal, Paul is suddenly thrown into a situation of doing what's right and what ever will help the Giants. It's truly what all independent films should model themselves after and it is overall an incredible film.",
