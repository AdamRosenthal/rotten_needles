Seeking to recapture the terrific chemistry that Messrs.

The film examines the inevitable conflict that exists between the divorced biological father who wants to retain some identity with his kids in spite of the step-dad now occupying the family residence. Obviously a subject more serious than comedic, the film tries to interject humor and to a certain extent succeeds. It is a light and easy film to watch with no great surprises enriched by the pleasant demeanor and screen presence of Mr. Ferrell.

The jokes on that matter are also pretty lame, with only a few making me mildly laugh. The direction of the film is also off and no real chemistry is felt within the casts, with the film just fluctuating it's character plot lines in different directions all over the place and just making the viewing nauseating. On the plus side Thomas Haden Church (Leo Holt) and Hannibal Buress (Griff) were actually the funniest parts of the film, playing their parts pretty well despite being minor characters.

The problem I had with this film is it's a mediocre comedy with bland performances, but it's a good comedy. Will Ferrell plays Brad Taggart a radio executive, who has a big heart and wants to be the best step-father ever to his wife's (Linda Cardellini) two children (Scarlett  Estevez and Owen Vaccaro). When her bad boy ex-husband Dusty (Mark Wahlberg) comes back to town, Brad feels insecure about him being there, Dusty wants to get back together with Sarah, so him and Brad have a competition on who wins the family. Dusty demonstrates his flair for athletics, home repair and bad boy charisma. So Brad finds himself in a tough situation to battle one-up his rival and win his family.
