Hiddleston is more of a victim of all of this and his character doesn't give him the chance to shine a lot but his performance is quite sweet. Wasikowska is a darling. She seems smart in the beginning but she takes a lot of time to realise where she's getting into, probably because of her innocence. Hunnam has very few space in this, which is a shame. In a nutshell, the story manages to hold our attention throughout the film. We know there's something wrong with Crimson Peak since the start but the script reveals us everything on the right time and it's cool to have that like this, not everything explained just in the final sequence. Well done del Toro!",

Both Mia Wasikowska and Tom Hiddleston deliver solid performance while Jessica Chastain surprises audiences the most in which she is able to have fun expanding the full potential of her eerie character physically, mentally and emotionally well. Despite the disappointing story line and the CGIs of the spirits which look like those in Mama, this artistic and sombre film on a woman trapped in the social conventions is worth a watch for its creativity of combining both modern and classical elements.",

Guillermo Del Toro does not rely on cheap scare tactics found in most horror movies (i.e. \"pop out\" scenes, over the top gore, etc.) but rather focuses on character development and the plot itself. This film does a great job of making the audience care about the characters and tells a good story. I wasn't so much scared in the traditional sense that I lose sleep at night; but more so that I connected with the characters and felt their suspense. The well developed characters and intriguing plot set up the viewer's emotions for the scary scenes. You may not necessarily come home from Crimson Peak and lose any sleep at night, but if you like a good story you will be satisfied and hope that Hollywood goes more in this direction with horror than it does most modern day horror flicks.",

This movie completely delivers on the visual front, the set designs are gorgeous, the high production values can be seen in every shot and every frame of the film, the house at Crimson Peak is so vibrant and a treat for the eyes. The story and the plot are not the strong points of this film and it's a problem which always haunts Del Toro's films, a bit predictable and cliched. The movie has four prominent characters, Mia Wasikowska is the main lead who marries Tom Hiddleston and portrays the usual victim/detective in the horror film and serves as the audience's eyes and ears in the film, Charlie Hunnam is there for plot reasons and does nothing special in the film, Tom Hiddleston is great in this film, he portrays the handsome and charming but mysterious Thomas Sharpe who is torn between the love for his sister and his new wife; Jessica Chastain is the best thing in this film, she plays a Lady Macbeth type of a character and is constantly involved in a power struggle of sorts with the new woman in her brother's life. Siblings often hint of an incestuous relationship which is again a very interesting angle in the film. The chemistry is great as well and Jessica Chastain after how underused she was in The Martian proves why she is one of the best working female actors. However in the end the film got a bit too predictable but the climax was very good, I have watched worse movies in the same genre thought it was a decent time pass.",

That being said, I am more than happy to let it be on its own and just sit back and enjoy. Thanks to truly beautiful visuals, Crimson Peak absolutely soars and confirms my love of Guillermo del Toro's films. It can be truly violent a couple of times and does manage to scare on a couple of occasions, but its usage of ghosts in a non-scary role is truly brilliant. The design of the supernatural elements is great and they are certainly metaphorical of something, but I am personally having trouble placing my finger on what. Though it is not scary, the film manages to still be deeply unsettling thanks to the great performance of Jessica Chastain. Mia Wasikowska and Tom Hiddleston were also particularly strong here. There are numerous things that stand out to me beside these things, including the symbolic usage of bugs, the brilliant costume design, and the fantastic production design. The whole lore of the mansion, the explanation of the name, and my God the visuals. I know I mentioned the visuals, but the cinematography and visual effects were absolutely phenomenal. Those alone are worth the price of admission. Crimson Peak will ultimately be looked down upon for not being scary thanks to a horrific marketing campaign, even though its intent is not to scare you, which is truly tragic because it is a wonderful film that is masterfully directed by del Toro and has a powerhouse performance from Chastain.",

Is it a masterpiece? No, Toro and his co-writer Matthew Robbins make an captivating story, that sometimes can be original and dab it with smart old-fashioned humor, the film is like a painting the colors are pure ecstasy and the watching the story is breathtaking. Mia Wasikowska (Alice In Wonderland, Friends With Kids) is somewhat okay in the film, but she is a revelation and makes this script work. Wasikowska plays Edith Cushing dreams of being a writer but blames her set backs on her handwriting because it gives her away as a female. Her father Carter (Jim Beaver) who's a business man who distrusts Thomas Sharp (Tom Hiddleston) who comes to Buffalo with a business proposal but quickly falls for Edith. After Carter bribes Thomas and his evil little sister Lucille (Jessica Chastain) back to their home in England things began to unravel. Edith marries Thomas they move into this mansion with Lucille who sulks about the property while making tea for her new sister in law. The performance here are stunning, so far this is the best performance I have ever seen from Jessica Chastain and Hiddleston is great as well. Grade A-",

      "text": "Misleading advertising has ruined many a movie, and unfortunately, Crimson Peak is another victim of poor marketing. Trailers made the movie out to be similar to recent scare fests like The Conjuring when it is actually more Gothic and romantic like Sleepy Hollow or Bram Stoker's Dracula. With all that being said, Crimson Peak is a very engaging and creepy film. Crimson Peak is about a woman named Edith, whose heart is stolen by a stranger who leaders her to a mysterious mansion atop a hill of blood-red clay, but she quickly learns that the house and her lover hold dark secrets. What may disappoint horror fans is that this movie isn't very scary. Apart from a great deal of dread and a couple of nail-biting sequences, Crimson Peak is not a horror film. Edith describes this film perfectly when she is describing a manuscript she wrote: \"It's not a ghost story; it's a story with ghosts in it.\" It's a beautifully filmed, sexual, violent Gothic romance. There are great performances from the entire cast, with Mia Wasikowska and Jessica Chastain giving standout performances, but the best character in the film is the house itself. The mansion's elaborate and darkly beautiful design make it one of the most memorable haunted houses in film, and every single shot of it is like a piece of art. Del Toro paints such stunning imagery in Crimson Peak that you could pick any frame from the movie and hang it as an art piece. He directs each actor and shot with grace and elegance that it makes up for the film's rather predictable plot. Crimson Peak isn't Del Toro's horror masterpiece as some people were expecting, but it is a beautifully crafted work of Gothic fiction that should be a suitable diversion just in time for Halloween.",

During the film, however, I caught myself concentrating on the technical aspects, rather than the emotional ones, but still completely got an appreciation for the compelling performances, especially Chastain's and Hiddleston's. It's by far the most scary and gory work del Toro has produced (not including The Strain). I was legitimately surprised by how much blood there is, and found the suspenseful setups brilliant. Why a 4-star rating? I thought about that a lot, because it really is a smart film. The truth is that, regardless of how dark, emotional, mystical even, it manages to be, the plot is quite boring: two siblings in search of a female, wealthy suitor in order to finally get a machine to work. There's something about that that feels dull to me. Also, the final act is a masterpiece in its execution.",
