The Gunman is Penn's return to a leading role where he seems to be taking a page out of Liam Neeson's book and looking to become an action star now that he has aged. Pierre Morel, the director of the original Taken film, is the director for the Gunman which had me interested but sadly the film just does hold up. The plot is sub-par and confusing in many places. The action isn't bad but its not going to be making any headlines and the characters are forgettable despite a pretty strong cast. The trailers promised a lot in this film that was almost non existent in the film. Idris Elba was one of the top billed characters in the film despite getting about 2 minutes of screen time in the film. The action is also often replaced with boring and cheesy drama and no one wants to see that.",
