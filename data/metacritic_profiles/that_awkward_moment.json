Jordan shouldn't sell himself short acting in this type of crap.  He's like Russell Westbrook playing at UCLA - averaging 10 points and a couple of assists against average competition, yet against the NBA's best, he shines.   Jordan needs a real part and he acts the hell out of it - see Fruitvale Station. And Miles Teller is a rising star with limitless upside.  He was great in The Spectacular Now and the best part of 21 and Over.   But neither Jordan nor Teller could save this movie from its bad writing, it's tone-deaf directing, and Efron's crappy acting.  Even the two leading actresses are pretty amazing. I'd never seen Imogen Poots in anything, but she's a comer. And Mackenzie Davis is destined for great things.  Seriously, take Efron out of the equation and hand the script over to a better writer, and you have the makings of a St.Elmo's Fire Junior.   But that's a lot to ask for.  Juding the movie on what it is, not what it should have been, I give it a solid 3.5, rounding down.  I even laughed a bit.  The other THREE people in my opening night audience didn't make a peep. They clearly were not in the target audience for this film.  Which is really another challenge for the makers of this film - finding that audience.",
