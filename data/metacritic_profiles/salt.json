Since Mat Damon BOURNE IDENTITY (2002) which is using more advance believability approach in runaway espionage tale, now everybody wants to be Bourne by running, jumping, shooting, fighting, car-chase, motorcycle-chase, you-name-it and it all happenned in one action-packed. Couple examples which using the similar patterns are: John Travolta FROM PARIS WITH LOVE (2009), Tom Cruise KNIGHT AND DAY (2010), Ashton Kutcher KILLERS (2010) and now it is Jolie turn. The story follows Evelyn Salt (Jolie) who has been instant-accused as a Russian spy who may be able to jeopardizing the national security. The Director is Phillip Noyce, the man behind THE BONE COLLECTOR in 1999 (also with Jolie). The camera angle is dynamic, especially in action sequences. Yes, the movie is full of twists and turns, even sometimes the story just go by itself without proper explanations, leaving too many questions and missing links. That is the uniqueness of the plots! The story is intriguing. It is successful to make us stay put in our seat by expecting what is going to happen next. To let Jolie fuses into action adventure like thiz is like releasing the fish into water, it is what she does best. Jolie is still the focus, shines among her mysterious partner (Liev Schreiber) and plain-straight boss (Chiwetel Eijiofor). If someone complains about how absurd thiz narratives has become, it is simply arguable and it all happens to every modern action movies. One thing for sure, Jolie is back with some kiss-ass moves, to show us she is definitely one of the most comfortable action heroines in our time. Thiz SALT is happened to be sweet more than you think it is.",

Though the star gave it all she got playing a Russian spy, she wasn't enough to save the film from its wrong pacing style and ridiculously bad plot. Being trained as a Russian spy since she was a little girl, Evenlyn Salt lived a secret second life all this time. She's married and has a dog. But she worked in the CIA, so I guess that's something. Given that Angelina Jolie played the role, we have high expectations that she'd pull it off with lots of dramatic scenes. And that's exactly what we got. From the moment that she was being tortured in North Korea to the moment when she killed her spy partner, she was great. But given the fact that every spy movies starts with an undercover life and being captured at the end, Salt adds nothing new to the genre.",

Confidential, Robin Hood) and Kurt Wimmer (Equilibrium, Law Abiding Citizen). \"SALT\" is a kind of ripped form the headlines type of action thriller seeing as it is taking its main plot and premise from a news story about a women who accused of being a Russian spy. \"SALT\" is a standard order thriller with amazing action sequences and death defying stunts the only thing that sets this film apart from other action movies is the fact that it has a seasoned and highly professional star in the lead role, a veteran action director who knows his way around action sequences and conspiracy thrillers. But the plot to this movie seems to be mired in an over abundance of action sequences and chase sequences and to add on top of all that the film clocks out at a measly 1hr. 39 min which leaves little for character development or story development but truth be told does a  movie like this  really  need all that? I don't think so. This film is more reliant on its action, stunts, chases, and Angelina Jolie's excellent performance as Evelyn Salt. This film has so many plot holes that you could drive a semi truck through it  is the epitome of over the top action  with each and every sequence delivering one brilliant filmed yet  outrageously implausible stunt after another. All the while, the audience is sitting there in awe at the stylish and gritty action that laid out for the audience. \"SALT\u00e2",

Weak characterization, a failure to convincingly make the plot believable, and kind of soulless action in a lot of places.  I had to really concentrate to stay engaged, but never was able to.  The movie simply doesn't lift the viewer up into the action and story, and I think it is because the nature of the story - an implausible cold war/terrorist cell strategy to destroy the US - isn't all that great.  Plus, the movie feels like an origin story - we are basically given a story that will justify 2 more movies later.

Of course, the driving force is Angelina Jolie as Evelyn Salt, a CIA agent who is accused of being a Russian spy. Salt is altogether a static character, but shifts in narrative constantly make our view of her dynamic, no knowing whether to pin her as hero or antihero, and Jolie plays this ambiguity to perfection. The movie itself isn't perfect, though - to me, occasional plot holes made it more confusing than \"Inception,\" and the idea of a Cold War carry-over in this day and age is somewhat laughable. Still, the movie plays its thrills right, and character of Salt fulfills what she was written to be - a bona fide action star.",

Angelina Jolie delivers a very solid and action-packed performance as Evelyn Salt, a CIA Agent who goes on the run after she is accused by a Russian defector as being a Russian spy. It's nothing ground-breaking as we have seen this before but its very entertaining as there is some genuinely incredible action sequences. The story is somewhat confusing at times to say the least yet somehow intriguing as you try to work out just who Salt is. The area where Salt does deliver is in the entertainment. Whether its the action sequences or the element of surprise and excitement it is a throughly watchable film. As i've said before SALT is certainly nothing fresh its been done before, Bourne anyone? Ofcourse the intriguing element is the story and background and that makes it ever so slightly different but also given the fact its a female its a very good alternative from the macho, muscle assassin on the run. All in all Salt is a hugely enjoyable film with plenty on offer and while the story is far from straightforward its certainly worth a watch plus with the way the movie ends I think its natural to assume this isn't the last time we'll be seeing Angelina Jolie as Salt, this movie may well kickstart another franchise!",

What does her husband have anything to do with the \"Russian setup\"? Wouldn't it be easier for Salt to \"assasinate\" Russian president if they kept it a secret? Did the Russian president agree to be killed for the whole plot? Did Salt know that Ted was a sleeping agent like her? If not, what was the whole point of sneaking into the Whitehouse bunker when she changed her mind? Why does Salt go so far to kill Ted when the president is alive? Why would Russia want to bring US down in these days, when cold war has been over for decades?[Let's save this one if I'm bringing in too much reality into movies] Is agnt Peabody the only one who can possibly know that Salt saved the day? Why does Salt have to go through dark knight thing when there is enough evidence --fingerprint at Orlov's-- and she can prove she did what she meant to do?)
