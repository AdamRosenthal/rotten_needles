This isn't a movie with just mindless comedy that doesn't even try, it actually has some good clever humor mixed in. That's the main problem with this movie though, comedy. There is certainly some very good moments in this movie, even memorable, but not many. A lot of the humor you see is actually pretty dull and might get you to chuckle but that's it. The other issue is SIDE character development. I say side because the main characters are pretty good, not the best by any means, but very good. The side characters though are very dull, including ones that I thought would be pretty interesting. The plot is sub-par with some interesting moments and twists. The biggest plus about this movie that might surprise some people is how they break up the funny moments with some very serious moments. It throws you off and when they bring up back a joke and makes it ten time funnier. I hope to see that practice in future movies and though this movies is a little ruff, it gives me hope that comedies still have a chance",
