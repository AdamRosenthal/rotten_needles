Too many mistakes in comparison between what happened and the script (like for instance, Biggie doing his freestyle in the year 1990, and with a zoom out you get to see him standing next to a poster of 2Pac's movie \"Juice\" which was released in 1992)",

I watched this not knowing a thing about the Notorious B.I.G and I did not feel lost at any part in the movie. It is also a movie about music that actually contains a good amount of music from that artist. I'm thinking about checking out biggie after watching this movie.",
