Maybe I don't have much to say about the stereotypical part of the movie, but there are other things that caught my attention, forgettable characters, usually a movie has at least one unforgettable character. For me there was ZERO. Another issue I had was a glitch in the story line (or two, or more), well maybe just one, but it was sure noticeable. The humans up in the booth. What did the main character say about having to come to Earth? It was a hassle to go 14 or 15 light years to get to Earth. From what I've seen, the humans didn't come with them back to their planet. Why would they go out of their way to go and get the two humans if it was such a hassle? Many unanswered questions, 2.4/10",

      "text": "Ayyyy dios... Bueno, es que.. \u00d3sea, qu\u00e9?! No tengo mucho que decir de esto, algunos personajes son planos y algo aburridos, no parecen tener mucha personalidad (excepto gary) los alienigenas del \u00e1rea 51 apenas me agradan, no dan risa, pero no irritan mucho... La animaci\u00f3n est\u00e1 bien, a pesar de que la pel\u00edcula sea de bajo presupuesto, con 40 millones de d\u00f3lares puedes hacer animaci\u00f3n decente. La banda sonora es poco memorable, no llegas a recordar ninguna pista o m\u00fasica en alg\u00fan momento. Tambi\u00e9n la comedia es estupida, ninguno de los chistes da risa, est\u00e1n mal ejecutados, el \u00fanico chiste que me dio risa fue en la guerra de comida, cuando unos tipos del \u00e1rea 51 veian la pelea, pero la c\u00e1mara estaba en blanco y negro, y no ten\u00eda audio, y uno de ellos empez\u00f3 a tocar el piano como si fuera un cortometraje de los 40's. Pero todos los chistes son mierda... La ejecuci\u00f3n de la pel\u00edcula es bastante rara. Cuando pasa una escena, pasa r\u00e1pidamente a otra, siendo esta muy apresurada, al hermano de gary lo secuestran a los 20 minutos de haber empezado la pel\u00edcula, dando como se puso muy apresurado la pel\u00edcula, aparte que cuando pasa una escena, con los mismos u otros personajes en otro escenario, parece como si fuera otra pel\u00edcula, o algo as\u00ed..",
