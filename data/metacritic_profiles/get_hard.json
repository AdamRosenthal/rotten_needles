      "text": "Get Hard tries to be a over the top, racist, profane and vulgar comedy. But the laughs are overused, and add no spice to the aging theme. The story plays out with James King (Will Ferrell) who gets convicted of a felony he never committed, and he gets sentenced to 5 years in a maximum security prison in San Quentin. James uses the help of his car washer, Darnell Lewis (Kevin Hart) to teach him the basics of prison, and how he can survive in the godforsaken place. But, Darnell never went to prison! Get Hard uses James to use his racist stereotypes against Lewis to make it funny. Sure, Kevin Hart does his best, and gives us some belly laughs, but Will Ferrell's racist, rich and totally bonkers, James King is one of the worst things about Get Hard. The pair do well together, even against the badly written script, the mediocre direction and the bland story, to create a funny movie. I appreciate the ways Get Hard takes you under the \"hood\" of prisons, and tells you about rape, and assaults in prison from a funny perspective. And, T.I gives a good performance as a Crenshaw Kings boss. All this, could have summed up to a really funny movie, but Get Hard doesn't try enough to get that medal. It's badly written, racist, offensive and gives us the worst Will Ferrell performance in years. But, if you don't get offended easily, Get Hard may be fun for you.",

      "text": "\"Get Hard\" Is the newest comedy from Will Ferrell and Kevin Heart, It's a buddy comedy based around Kevin Heart teaching Will Ferrell's character how he will survive in prison as a old white guy.The humor is this movie if very offensive and vulgar but is what you come to expect from this type of comedy. Some jokes are extremely funny and the addition of great improve between Kevin and Will really adds to the jokes, but some jokes fall horribly flat. Most other actors in the film don't leave much of an impression on you, most of them only appear at the beginning or end of the film. Will and Kevin work great together in this film and if your a fan of buddy comedy's I'm sure you will enjoy this but \"Get Hard\" Isn't anything special.",

I feel like Ferrell has a lot more comedic lines than Hart and that Hart was there mainly so that Ferrell could make the jokes. The best way I can put it is:",
