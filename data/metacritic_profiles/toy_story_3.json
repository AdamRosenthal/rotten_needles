Critics are calling it \"heartbreaking\" and \"inspiring\", and a movie critic from NYT even went as far as calling it \"a deep, complex take on mortality\". Seriously? Personally, I found Toy Story 3 of being a surprisingly formulaic and unappealing movie of the following reasons. Firstly, the same story formula is being recycled for the third time! Just like in the other two movies, the toys are separated from Andy. Overall, the plot just feels like one big excuse to move the characters from the backdrop of Andy's room to the daycare center where the story is being transformed into a prison break parody, filled with plot-twists, slapstick humor and gay-jokes, directly aimed at the adults in the audience. But the worst thing is that this movie isn't treating the characters with respect. Rather than having them develop beyond the minimal standard required for the plot, the directors focused more on having them do stupid things and end up in stupid situations. There are about a dozen different toys in the series now, most of which only functions as comic relief characters that stick around in the background. The majority of these toys spend more times being chewed on by drooling babies than showing any character development, whatsoever. Buzz and Woody are really the only ones worth mentioning, which is sad, because both Woody and Buzz are terribly simplistic in this third installment. Woody is the same few-worded, whiny character he was in the other two movies. But it's okay. He doesn't change because the plot requires him to stay the same. But Woody was never the star of this series. It was the space ranger, Buzz, who stole the show back in 1995. In Toy Story 3, the ugly doll is reduced to pure, stupid and brain-dead entertainment. The only character development Buzz Lightyear demonstrates isn't more complex than the switching on the button in his back. He spends the majority of the movie in \"demo-mode\", delivering catchphrases and references to his delusional space-persona. And it's funny about the first time he does it and not quite as funny about the tenth time. And he spends the rest of the movie as a surprisingly distasteful and offensive Spanish stereotype. And really, oh so devoted Pixarfans, doesn't the fact that the directors would take Buzz Lightyear and change him so carelessly in the film speak volumes of their indifference to their own characters' personalities? I just can't figure out what, if anything, makes this movie so good. From my point of view, It is terrible! And it becomes even more staggering when you think about how other animated movies, personal favorites that are by far more sophisticated and complex; Like How to Train Your Dragon and Bolt, are being pushed in the background to make way for the unyielding glorification of Pixar. Okay, both of these movies have been met fairly well by critics, particularly Dragon, but none of them have received the attention Toy Story 3 received, despite being more deserving. My personal favorite, Bolt, was very underrated, almost overlooked, when realized back in 2008.",

      "text": "I have never been a really big fan of Pixar's animated movies.  It has never been the quality or the writing; it just has to do mostly with the subject matter or the overly cartoony look of it all.  It just doesn't appeal to me.  Toy Story was an excellent movie, while 2 could be considered a bit less accomplished, and usually it just gets worse from there.  Luckily the people at Pixar have a high stamp of quality in pretty much all their products, and not just from a visual point of view.  Toy Story 3 is an amazing movie that takes you back to a time when everything was new and you could swear that your toys were alive.  The movie could have been anything but good.  It could have been an easy cash grab for Pixar; they could have done it for the money.  Instead they decided to end (?) their series in rare form these days: on an incredibly high note.  The story tackles some very serious issues in regards to growing up and moving on with life, and gave me many flashbacks of how I felt as a child.  It's a very special thing to find something that moves you like this, much less from a bunch of animated polygons, but Toy Story 3 (and pretty much all the Pixar movies) are some of the very best at conveying the emotion needed to portray their characters as real beings with complex emotions and motivations.  The voice acting, with Hanks, Allen, and the rest of the cast (most of them) return as if no time has passed, sliding into their roles effortlessly.  It's a very satisfying thing after all this time to hear Woody's voice again; I didn't realize just how much I had missed it.  I don't think there was much that I didn't like about this one, although some children may have some issues with the darker parts of the movie, which I actually applaud Pixar for delving into, it's nothing a nice parent to child dialogue can't work out.  All in all this is a great way to end a series (if it is at an end, and I hope this is the case), as a class act like this can teach other potentials just how the final movie should be.",

It's the word that comes to mind, not just for the movie itself, but for the brilliant work Disney did in taking an already immediate classic, collecting its treasures, and then expanding upon them in ways unimaginable in a launching of their third film: \"Toy Story 3.\" The plot feels fresh and keen, usually uncharacteristic of a continuation. There are no signs of unfunny, moronic, paltry humor and adages but rather laughs brought on by the conduction of its characters. The way the film conveys human emotion is done so fluently that you can't help but draw a tear when the characters do. Many times in modern animated cinema, characters seem aloof and disconnected from the live voice they are given. This is what sets \"Toy Story 3\" apart from those doll-faced, skin-deep wastes of filmic expression. The depth of each character is such a marvel to watch, that if too consumed, the viewer can neglect such extraordinarily fine and often surreptitious detail displayed in the same scene. The \"movie of all ages\" feature is also topnotch as the kids can comprehend the outward action as the adults can take in the deep, subliminal thematic situations and humor. After viewing \"Toy Story 3\" you come to the realization that life, like a playroom, is a place where we interact, learn, fail, succeed, are sad, happy, and then are used up. Like Woody, Buzz, and the gang, we all fear the day where we will be replaced or \"thrown in the trash bag.\" This is just one of the many conceptual and mundane themes that people relate to from \"Toy Story 3,\" Absolute treat for anyone! 5/5 stars.",

      "text": "THE MATRIX is the best action movie ever made in my list. When Matrix released on its time, thiz movie created many breakthrough on world cinema. Directed by Larry and Andy Wachowski, who is just recently popular in thiz movie. They just known previously as small budget film Director, BOUND (1996). Later, the movie has two more sequels MATRIX RELOADED and MATRIX REVOLUTION in 2003. You can almost classify the Stars of thiz movie as B-Class Casts, except Keanu Reeves, but still the outcome is beyond the expectations. Each of the characters like: Neo (Keanu Reeves), Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) , even the villain Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) already become a legendary icon in the industries. One of the fervencies of thiz movie is on the action scene. The fight scene is something new and different, which follows later by other movies. Behind that extraordinary fight scene is well-known Martial Arts Choreographer, Yuen Woo Ping. Woo Ping is the man behind CROUCHING TIGER, HIDDEN DRAGON(2000), KILL BILL (2003),THE FORBIDDEN KINGDOM (2008), even Jackie Chan classic action SNAKE IN THE EAGLE SHADOW (1978). His experiences in a lot of Asian movies made him effective.  The movie definitely exceed beyond our imagination. In fact, many people did not understand entirely the story of THE MATRIX, there are still many blank spot to question about. The Content of the movie fills with great philosophies inside. It seemed to me Wachowski Brothers discovered successfully how to make a brilliant concept from some of religions. The essence is not that simple as appear to be, Actually we will always have something new, every time we watch it.",

Those folks at Pixar are really outdone themselves, move the hell out of the way How to Train a Dragon let Toy Story pick up its Oscar before schedule. The movie begins with the imagination of a young boy and we kind of see what the toys see when there playing with their kids. Then a homemade video of Andy when he was younger playing with the toys. The gang is scared because Andy hasn't played with them for a long time and to make matters worse he's going off to college. The toys are afraid to be thrown away. After a confusion the toys accidentally do get thrown away and feeling rejected they decide to donate themselves to a daycare ignoring Woody's protest. When they get there they get accepted with the toys and Lots-O the leader of the daycare makes them feel at home even though we feel something wrong.  This movie proves that animation is growing and growing big. We need animation in every aspect of the genres. United States has categorized animation with children but can be use in every film. The Toy Story crews are true pioneers for this craft. The film looks outstanding much more improved then the first two. We get lot character models and facial expressions from toys and lot more human interactions as well. Everything is nicely animated from Andy's house to the daycare and other locations. There are times which I want just pick up these toys and freaking hug them. Everybody is nicely cast and including some new ones as well. The voice casting is downright excellent just like the first two. The plot is so well written with so many themes to teach. It teaches us about our loss of our childhood and we lose are imagination as we get older. The acceptance of being adult, it teaches about overcoming greed and being a family no matter what the circumstances are. Lastly with all the movies that are ending with obligatory action sequences and slapstick. Toy Story has one of the most beautiful endings ever. This movie reminded me so much of my childhood and sometimes I miss it. The film has the best ending of a trilogy since I saw the Lord of The Rings ending. I miss when cinema was like this a strong plot, strong performances. The film industry needs this kind of cinema. Go watch Toy Story 3 and be amazed.",

In this film though the pain that these bunch of toys felt brings me to tears and adults snifle, but kids will only laugh since they don't understand the concept of losing a toy, they don't know how to feel, they might understand in the future but for now, it's just an adult animation that sadly only be appeal for those 13 and above.",

I had a blast watching as it knows when to blend the right sense of humor in excellent timing and when to go dramatic to appropriately add a good sense of emotion for each character. It`s cast of voice actors are believable and goes perfectly into every character. Even I though didn`t see it in 3-D, from what I heard is that the audiences had a blast.

This time around, Andy's off to college and he's done playing with his toys. After an accident, the toys get donated to Sunnyside Day Care centre, which turns out to be anything but sunny. (its always the misleading, lovely sounding names) We get loads of new characters, Peas in a Pod, Ken and my favourite, Mr Pricklypants. They all blend perfectly into the story, and we get the villian of the piece: Lotso Huggins bear. He isn't a generic villian, you see his plight through flashback, and genuinly feel sorry for the villian. We've also lost a number of characters. Woodys girlfriend, Bo Peep, Wheezy and the lovable RC. Its sad to not see them, but thank heavens we still have the likes of Ham, Mr Potato head and the lovely aliens. Theres a lot of wonderful moments, like the opening play scene with evil Dr Porkchop, and the ending scene as the toys are in their new home with new friends. Theres also a sweet moment, as the toys are about to be burnt, and just accept it, holding hands. But another wonderful moment occurs, as the aliens save the toys with \"The Claw\" The thing with Toy Story 3 is you've been with these characters since the beginning, since the first Toy Story. We've loved them through their adventures against evil neighbour Sid and villianous Prospector. We've seen them play happily with Andy as he grew up, and now that he's grown up, you really feel for these characters as Andy no longer plays with them like the old days.

The toys were ecstatic about it until they found out that the kids there are disgusting and there is a huge evil bear with a one-eyed baby doll guarding them. Adding adventure to the already interesting plot, Woody and the gang decided to humorously escape the center with great style. Director Lee Unkrich, who is not new at all to the Pixar directing department, he's been responsible for Finding Nemo, Monsters, Inc., and co-director of Toy Story 2. So picking him for the job is not a bad idea. He brought something completely new to the table and turned the story around with twists and thrills. Lee Unkrich had done a decent job of directing this beloved film which had both adults and kids crying their hearts out. From the beginning where Andy's home videos are being played to the end where Andy was saying his final good-byes to the toys, Toy Story 3 is a must-see for all ages and it touched all of our hearts one way or the other.

It was so funny how the movie shut everyone up and brought us all together. Everyone was cheering, laughing, and crying at all the same parts. I swear this movie takes down everyone into tears whether they admit it or not. a week later I took my little cousins to see this movie and they had all the same reactions. this movie takes all the themes form the last two movies and brings them out into such a high emotional level that everyone young or old can love it. It's a blast to watch just for fun too. Toy Story is a kids movie series for every generation to infinity and beyond",

Toy Story 3 is fine example of this and gives every quality of a truly good film: perfectly selected music, quirky and life-like characters, flawless and skillful animation, a clever script and of course pure originality.

Nevertheless, this movie had the one quality that mattered to the viewers: it touched on the nostalgia of our childhood memories.  The ending that everyone is alluding to is the perfect example of this.  The best part is the older viewer never saw it coming.  We are suddenly rerouted down this emotional path causing us to reflect on the changes we make as we move beyond our childhood years.  It is a bittersweet reflection and one that requires a 230 pound father of a little girl to choke up and clear the dust that is tearing in his eye.

I was four when the first Toy Story came out, and eight when the second one did. I pretty much grew up on Disney movies, Toy Story and Lion King being the two I watched most. Probably a few hundred times between the two of them (no exaggeration). I literally grew up with Woody, Buzz and the gang. Coincidentally, I started my first year of college last year, so Andy and I share a connection that is very personal to me. The people over at Pixar have done what has only happened a few times in history. Let's hope they take home the Oscar for Best Picture like the Lord of the Rings did, although I wouldn't get my hopes up. Those Academy douche bags... But back to Pixar. They created a damn near perfect trilogy. I loved this movie. This may be blasphemy to some of you, but I have to admit that Shrek 2 still holds the crown as my all time favorite animated film. After that is How To Train Your Dragon, then probably Toy Story 3 and Toy Story 2 tied at third. Ratatouille is tied with Monster's Inc. for a very close fourth. As you can see, Pixar dominates my list, that does go on, by the way. Anyway, I think this was a perfect way to close the trilogy. The last fifteen minutes or so were very heartfelt and touching. I was on the verge of tears. When Woody said goodbye to Andy in the closing moments, I felt as if he was talking directly to me. The movie is altogether excellent. I have to admit that I was a bit nervous that it wouldn't impress me as much as everyone said it would. After reading over a dozen reviews with perfect scores, I had expectations that almost always lead to disappoint. I'm happy to say I was not. Not even close. The script is very well done. The music is just as great. The voice acting never felt insincere. And most importantly, I never got the feeling that some studio executive told the geniuses at Pixar to make this movie because it would clean out the pockets of millions of moviegoers I'm talking to you DreamWorks. I almost hated Shrek after the third movie, then they did a fourth?! No, I never got that feeling from this movie at all. It was a rejuvenation to a property that was already loved by almost everyone. The graphical detail in the picture was incredible. I have been fighting the Blu Ray takeover for months, but if there was ever a movie that would make me take my first step, it's this one. Nope, not even Avatar could make me do it, and I loved Avatar. I didn't see the movie in 3D because I heard some bad things about how dull it was. So I won't comment on that, but even without it, this movie is gorgeous. I loved it, and I cannot wait to buy it. I'm actually glad I never bought the first two. That means I can get whatever special trilogy box set they release hopefully this holiday season. It saddens me to know that their adventures are over, but I'm glad it ended the way it did. Waiting eleven years to do the final entry was probably not intentional, but it worked out for the best. At least for me because of my age corresponding to Andy's. I'm really going to miss those toys (at least until I get that box set). May Toy Story live forever.",

I would love to see an adventure with the buddies together by each others side. The ending was wonderful when it showed the picture of Andy and his toys, it was very touching.

Now, 15 years after their original debut and 11 years after the first sequel, Toy Story 2, Woody (voice of Tom Hanks), Buzz (Tim Allen), and their fellow toys have returned to the screen for another adventure. Although aspects of Toy Story 3 echo similar elements from the previous films, making this the least original entry in the trilogy, the movie's final act will resonate deeply with many viewers, making this chapter in many ways the most heartfelt.",
