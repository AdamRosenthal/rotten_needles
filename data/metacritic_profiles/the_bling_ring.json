The movie opens with a nighttime robbery, as teens scale a fence and slip, ninja-like, onto what at first glance would appear to be a well-secured property. As the film jumps forward to their capture and then flashes back to tell their story (mitigated through media interviews), The Bling Ring clarifies that this is Orlando Bloom\u2019s house. But the prologue\u2014and its security-cam, night-vision POV\u2014establishes the movie\u2019s unusual dual perspective. This is a tale of obsessive fans, superficially unfolding from their version of events but observed by Hollywood royalty, passively watching as onlookers storm the castle. Based on a Vanity Fair article by Nancy Jo Sales, The Bling Ring is inspired by an actual 2008\u20132009 rash of L.A.-area robberies, when a group of high-schoolers from Calabasas, California, managed to invade the estates of Bloom, Paris Hilton, Lindsay Lohan, Megan Fox, and others, helping themselves to whatever they wanted. As the movie tells it, the spree begins when a smiling sociopath (Katie Chang) ropes the new kid in \u201cdropout school\u201d (Israel Broussard) into breaking into a friend\u2019s house. Soon their sights turn to celebrities. It\u2019s easy to know when \u201cParis\u201d is out of town because of \u201cnews\u201d on the Internet\u2014and apparently she, too, leaves her keys under the mat. As the ring expands to include the duo\u2019s friends (notably ones played by Emma Watson, who steals the movie, and Taissa Farmiga, Vera\u2019s younger sister), The Bling Ring quietly ponders entitlement culture. In one sense, there\u2019s not much separating these hard-partying, brand-blinded teens from Lindsay Lohan, nabbed for shoplifting at around the same time. Dedicated to the late cinematographer Harris Savides, who was unable to complete filming, The Bling Ring shoots each robbery with a perverse matter-of-factness. It\u2019s easily Coppola\u2019s least flashy film, but that\u2019s not to say it lacks poetry\u2014the burglarizing of Hills star Audrina Patridge\u2019s home is shown in a single, gorgeous long shot. If the tone of lyrical crime saga has critics name-checking Spring Breakers (the portrait of adolescent ineptitude also recalls Larry Clark\u2019s Bully), The Bling Ring isn\u2019t so much interested in provocation as sociology. Manufacturing this sort of fame is an exercise in mutual exploitation. Ostensibly victimized by the thefts, Paris Hilton is apparently healed enough to contribute a cameo\u2014and flattered enough to allow Coppola to film in what\u2019s reportedly her actual home. The movie captures a moment when the lines separating anonymity, fame, and notoriety are finer than ever. And as Watson\u2019s social climber prattles on to reporters about what a great \u201clearning lesson\u201d her criminal experience has been, it\u2019s easy to see another star in the making.",

      "text": "I wasn't expecting much with this movie but wow, the Bling Ring is really a stinker. First of all, even though it's only 90 minutes long, which is pretty short, it feels like it drags on and on the entire time. The cinematography was horrendous with the overuse of the slow-motion effects. The acting wasn't bad but none of the roles required much either. The characters were all pretty shallow as well. Yes, they're supposed to be but other than Emma Watson's character, none of them felt authentic. Speaking of Emma, she is the only reason this film is worth watching. She's smoking hot and delivers a solid performance. I think this film does shine a light on the repercussions of celebrity obsession but the movie doesn't take advantage of that message, instead focusing almost entirely on stealing, doing drugs, and partying in slo-mo. Sofia Coppola missed the mark here, that's for sure.",

Almost every single scene that isn't a montage considerably exceeds its needed length, and as the dialogue strictly (bar Leslie Mann) consists out of teenagers' gossip and prattle and only is worth listening to, to find out that Emma Watson can sport a West Coast accent rather well, there's boredom arising quite frequently. Since pros for watching the film more than once are virtually non- existent and skipping it won't be regarded as a gap in cinematic education by anyone, The Bling Ring is Sofia Coppola's worst film.",
