It fails in many ways, but is not so obviously bad at any one point that it made me finally give it up. It's just that when there's such famous actors involved on such a weighty subject, you really expect more. There is no chemistry in the leads, there is no consistency in the actions, it isn't funny (when it tries), it never develops momentum. It also seems odd to have a terminal patient feeling energetic enough to energetically do whatever they want with smiles and laughter so close to death. That aspect finally rings so untrue, I began to wonder how much better it would be to have the script and actors facing some more serious symptoms. When you find yourself wishing for more bad things to happen to a character in a film, that's a bad sign.",
