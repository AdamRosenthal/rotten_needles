      "text": "First and foremost, \"Ouija: Origin of Evil\" may very well be the biggest surprise hit, in my opinion, of the year. I went from writing off this origin story because of how bad the first one was. Then giving it some respect because the thriller/horror mastermind, Mike Flanagan, was tagged to it. Who, might I add, directed the hit-or-miss \"Oculus\" and made the fantastic Netflix exclusive \"Hush\" (Click here for my review of it). Now, I am here making this review, in love with this movie and now this series. Mike Flanagan masterfully created an origin story to a series that was so investing and so eerily creepy that it, at times, made my skin crawl. Story alone, this film keeps the audience so curious throughout the film until the very end when it hits you full force with consistent terror. This is not simply a jump scare movie, although it has its moments, I have just grown immune to them. I found the slow burn creepy actions and mannerisms far more terrorizing than an attempt at catching me by surprise. In a sense, the film toys with the audience as they expect to be scared but right when you think it may happen, it pulls off the trigger. A fantastic element of which I applaud Mr. Flanagan.",

Everything about how this movie looks feels fantastic, from the camera work down to the old fashion cue marks, Universal logo and title card. The acting and characters is particularly good, with the film really taking its time to set up its story and protagonists. The dark, creepy atmosphere of this movie is definitely captured well, for the most part. Whilst there are some cheap jump-scares during 1st act, it becomes much more suspenseful and genuinely scary during the 2nd and 3rd acts. Whilst the end feels a bit rushed and out of place, its serviceable and in the end, Ouija: Origin of Evil is in fact, a solid movie.",

Unlike Lights Out (that had a few elements of originality)'Ouija: Origin of Evil' follows a Mother who is running a scam fortune telling business and her two daughters who lost their dad recently. The reason I bothered to mention their dad died recently is because they mention his departure a lot, in every scene in fact. Just in case the audience forgot. The beauty of this film is that you don't have to retain any information from the previous scene because they just blurt out exposition during any moment of plot development anyway. The acting is OKAY but it's pathetic character arcs and the character's non existent personalities give the actors little to work with.",
