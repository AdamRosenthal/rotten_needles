The acting isn't oscar worthy but that is because the movie features young actors who serve their purpose. The actors haven't starred in many movies but a thriller such as this doesn't require world renowned actors. There are enough jump scenes in this movie if you are into that in a horror movie. I thought I would enjoy this thriller and I did. I expected it to be creepier and more psychological than it is. The trailer lead me to believe that the movie would be creepier and gorier. I was disappointed overall with the movie but it is still worth a viewing. Ouija sends creepy vibes to the viewer and there are some neat tricks that the director used in the movie. The characters are lead astray and once they are tricked this leads to their demise. A decent thriller with some drawbacks but no flaws that impair the enjoyment of the movie.",

I was connected to the actors and to the point that in the first 15 minutes one of the actors was killed and it brought a tear to my eyes. You dont see or feel that way about most movies these days. Great Job well performed and acted. Its a must see movie that fits the time of year. But can be watched anytime.",

The casts was just playing a board game and then some strange monsters coming to haunt them. This is stupid. The dialogue, the acting, it's terrible. Does anyone remembers Witchboard from the 80's? I haven't seen that s**t in years. People should buy this movie out, awesome horror movie. As for Ouija?

Some of the best acting i've ever seen, particularly the protagonist Luigi whose acting left me anxious, terrified and curious to watch more - the emotions I simply can't explain. Many people critique the quality of acting in Ouija - it's clear that these people are ignorant, unable to grasp the complexity and skill required to perform such parts as Debbie whose entire group of best friends are slowly killed by Luigi",
