This same story could have been told with a lot more excitement if flashbacks, or at least some more lines, were added.  It's all very convincing, but if you look at 127 Hours, or Life of Pi, you'll see how much more engaging this type of movie can be.  Redford did a decent job acting but it wasn't a very challenging role to play.  He just had to hold a serious face the whole time.

However the end result just makes it boring when it\u2019s so easy to compare it to other films such as Cast Away and The Perfect Storm. There\u2019s virtually no character development either, if you start the movie off by connecting with the character (fatherly or personally) you\u2019ll enjoy it, if you think he\u2019s a rich jerk with a boat then you can\u2019t wait to see him fail, but this doesn\u2019t matter because you\u2019ll never know anything about him, other than that he knows how to sail quite well. I can respect it as an art film, but as a form of entertainment it feels hallow, stretched, boring (like being stuck out at sea, I get it). If you\u2019re a Robert Redford fan (The Sting, Spy Games) you\u2019ll find it okay, if you\u2019re an artsy Robert Redford fan you\u2019ll like it, if you like sailing it\u2019s definitely entertaining, but if you\u2019re looking for a movie night with some friends you might want to pass on it.

If he had started to pump immediately, he might have saved his electrical system, including the batteries, depending of course on how good or large-capacity the electric bilge pump was. Second, an immediate emergency repair of the hull would have been in order. There is a technique of wrapping a sail around the hull as a temporary measure to keep the water from pouring in, and many cruising sailboats carry pieces of waterproof fabric (such as sailcloth), and ways to attach them to the hull, to make immediate emergency repairs.",

I did like the way the boat was patched and he did try to get noticed by the containers, but as most sailors know, there is no one on the bridge of the containers and no one wandering around their decks at night.

I do know that there wasn't any hand at the end and that he died or drowned.  The photography was great and I was sad to see the boat sink.

Also, more information should have been provided about where exactly he was (like a map) and where he was heading. Being someone unfamiliar with boats, it would have helped sustain my interest to know more about what he was doing after the storm hit. Frankly, being 1 hour and 45 minutes of a solitary sailor with no dialog, this film just lost it for me half way through. I still do not understand what the critics saw in this movie to give it high ratings. It seems like a self indulgent fantasy by Mr. Redford.

The film has no problems communicating all of the problems facing our protagonist and does so very effectively, as there is a ton of tension in a film that Netflix describes as \"harrowing\", which is truly a great way to describe it. The cinematography here is gorgeous and, in particular, the shots from underneath the water are breathtakingly beautiful.

With little to no dialogue, \u2018All is Lost\u2019 is filled with subtext and relies on Robert Redford tremendous talents to hold the screen alone. Redford\u2019s unnamed character (titled \u2018Our Man\u2019 in the credits), is an ambiguous figure with literally no back-story; but that made him all the more intriguing. There was no scenery chewing in the performance, just plain stoicism as his character steers peril in the eye\u2026 all truly felt lost. Chandor is no stranger to the dynamics of the 2008 financial crisis, and it\u2019s very possible that some of these issues are layered between the fine lines of this story. With an abandoned shipping container being the initial cause of Our Man\u2019s high seas accident, one could relate that to the irresponsibility of big corporations and the negative effects it has on the people. However, as you would expect from this metaphorical movie; it\u2019s all up to each viewer\u2019s interpretation. I applaud the rigorous efforts placed in producing this film, but for some reason I thought it was a tough film to fully connect to. It may be due to its stark minimalism or maybe the subtle emotional payoff. In any case, it was one of the year\u2019s most ambitious movies, and I encourage anybody up for a challenge to give it a try.",

The plot is simple but masterful some would find this type of film boring but not me i have actually stayed out on a boat for two weeks when i was younger and i had a blast. The film opens up with Robert Redford waking up to little spurts of water coming into his boat he gets up to see that he had clipped the edge of a container full of shoes that had fallen off a cargo ship. Well he ends up fixing the hole in his ship and life goes on as before but soon a huge storm hits and while fixing things around inside his boat a big wave hits his boat causing him to hit his head on a steel post that knocks him out. He then wakes up to water up to his thighs so he gets out a life raft and starts to gather some food and other things and he gets inside is life raft that is being pulled behind the boat. From here we watch Robert Redford try to survive in the open water as he tries to make his way to the Sumatra Straits in hope that he ends up being saved.",
