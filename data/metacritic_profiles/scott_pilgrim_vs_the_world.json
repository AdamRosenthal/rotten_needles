The women in the film are uniformly excellent - except for Knives - I could have used less of her fawning.

The World is an entertaining movie that shows action with great stunts that the character is fighting like a champion to face against all people that refer to Mario from \"Super Mario Bros\" and Link from \"The Legend of Zelda. Michael Cera did great as a character named Scott Pilgram and he's more funny in many other films. The characters are so interesting,I really love Mary Elizabeth playing as a hot girl with different colors in her hair named Ramona Victoria Flowers and she did a good role. So does the other characters and I like the way they acted like their in a video game to face against Scott Pilgram. It has alot of joustings everywhere in scenes,where Scottt is fighting a villian with jump shots  and facing each other. The vissual effects are very interesting and more updating around the place and it has funny words and subtitles in the movie like that. So I hope that you will enjoy this movie,it's very good,very funny,and the movie has a good perspective based on the comic book for the fans.

The only real question should be how effective is it in the film medium to consistently and irreverently poke holes in the fourth wall (look it up if you must).  Not many films can pull this off without stealing the energy out of a scene, and even fewer can do it and add multiple levels of texture and charm.  This film is NOT an exercise in depth, it's the opposite.  It's an experiment in the relative unimportance of all thing pop culture.  Here no one is trying to figure out anything or learn something new, it's just an internally laconic, externally  hyper active cycling through the the various digital entertainment streams which construct the world through which young people attempt to relate to each other.

I saw it at a midnight showing, and my entire world was changed!! The tagline's \"An epic of epic epicness.\" I'm here to say that the tagline doesn't lie. The haters may think that its random and stupid!! Well, you people are wrong! Edgar Wright is an amazing director!! From the very beginning with the Universal logo turned 80s video game, to the final battle, this movie is endlessly engaging, extrememly original, and so freaking funny!! Michael Cera usually plays an insecure little nerd. Here, he plays a butt-kicking video game addict!! Mary's is perfect as the mysterious but sexy Ramona Flowers. Kieran Culkin steals every scene he's in as Scott's hilarious gay roommate who always wakes up with one or more dudes in his bed. Ellen Wong's great as Scott's stalking 17 year-old exgirlfriend. The exes, especially Lucas Lee, Matthew Patel, Todd Ingram, and Gideon are great!!Anna Kendrick, the members of Sex-Bob-Omb, and everyone else is pretty good, too. And that was just the cast!! The dialouge is very clever and freaking hilarious!! Also, the film is brilliantly directed by the great Edgar Wright, who showed us with Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz that he could direct some neat scenes, proves with this movie that he should be up there with George Lucas and Zack Synder. The video game battles are exciting and thrilling!! The video game references are cool, too. An honorable mention goes to the choreographer, Bill Pope, who along with the great work he did on this, also did the Matrix movies, the Spiderman movies, and some Jackie Chan movies. The bottom line is, this movie is unlike anything ever made!! Action-packed, hilarious, and with a good heart, you'd be a fool to miss this movie!!!",

He has established himself further into the good books with Scott Pilgrim vs The World. I knew as soon as I saw the 8-bit version of the Universal Pictures logo that this would be an awesome film. Michael Cera was the ideal person to cast as Scott Pilgrim in my opinion. He didn't come across as somebody he is not and the dominant side of his personality only came out in the fight scenes and that is how it should have been. The editing and the motion graphics/special effects were amazing and added a lot to the film. The opening titles were representative of what the movie was going to be like and it didn't disappoint. It's original, creative and most importantly humorous. There are many ways you can read into the film in regards to the theme and message it is trying to get across but it is, to me, about the extent an innocent geeky teen male will go to, to get the girl of his dreams. Ramona Flowers was hot too, even if she didn't seem to care too much about Scott throughout.",

He plays the nervous, kinda-wimpy role in each of his films, and thats good as like a sidekick, or a co star, but didn't think he could pull it off. Then came Scott Pilgrim I'll spare any plot explinations, as you probably know of this already, and get straight to the reviewing. The video game references are lined throughtout the film, from the 8-bit Universal logo to the defeated villians turning into coins. This film proudly shows its roots, along with animated sequences that look like they've come straight out of the comic book. The evil exes are quite formidable foes, but Lucas Lee has to be the best one, purely because of Chris Evans' portrayal (can't wait to see his Captain America) its a shame Lee isn't on for longer, cause every sentance that escapes his mouth is a riot, but he wasn't on for much longer in the comic, so it fits perfectly. We gotta give a big hand to the supporting characters. Knives Chau's obsession over Scott doesn't border onto annoying, and she goes to great lengths to win back Scott, even (failingly) dying her hair Ramona blue. Kieran Culkins character has to be my favourite character of the entire film, from his texting of Scotts life to his sister, to his coming onto the sisters boyfriend, he cannot go through an entire scene without brightening it up or spouting a funny comment (especially at Sex Bob-Ombs rival band) Gideon Graves is quite the formidable villain, I won't spoil the evil things he does but they fit when this film is setting him up to be the final boss. The fight scenes are brilliantly done (especially with Swords involved), the character moments are sweet, the humour is pitch-perfect, the characters are fantastic, and the evil exes are quite menacing. Scott and Ramonas romance is so lovely. Here, it seems to be a mere fling of the moment, while in the books its more of a serious relationship, and yes, parts have been sacrificed but i think Edgar Wright chose wisely. Kudos to Scott Pilgrim VS The World, and of course to Michael Cera, a great choice for the lead",

      "text": "Life is a video game, whether you think about it or not. There's always that princess we need to rescue and there are those baddies we need to defeat. And you know, it couldn't have been better said than with \"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World\" This movie is awesome. Epic, even. (mind the Snagglepuss comment). What I think makes this movie work is that they portray this entire film like a video game, right from the opening \"Universal\" shot performed in 8-bit. I mean it, they do the music Nintendo style. That I found to be funny. The movie starts off with Michael Cera as Scott Pilgrim, even though he's playing him like Michael Cera. I'm not his biggest fan since he's played the same character in every movie from \"Superbad\" to \"Juno\". Yet, despite this, this is his best role. He's still the meek geek, but he grows a pair and kicks ass. Anyway, he's the bassist of an indie band called \"Sex Bob-omb\" (just work with me) who's currently dating a 17-year old high schooler named Knives. However, they put everything in a cross between video-game and comic book aesthetic. Anyway, while they're dating, he meets Ramona, who's sort of an indie Princess Peach. She was a damsel in distress without really being so much as a damsel in distress. Anyway, word goes out that they're going out, and now Scott has to fight her seven ex's, which is used as an implication gag as Michael Cera keeps thinking she meant ex-boyfriends. (Let's just say she was curious.) Anyway, he fights them, and every time they're defeated, they turn into coins and add up points like an arcade game. As the movie goes on, it turns out that Ramona isn't the only person with evil ex's. Scott has some of his own, and they keep coming back to his life. You have a rock queen who sort of looks like Renee Zellweger, a sarcastic ginger who's the drummer in his band, of course Knives (but she's not really evil), and I don't know if she is an ex but the sarcastic girl from \"Funny People\". But Scott doesn't fight them, he must fight Ramona's, which range from rock stars to ninja queens. My favorite evil ex had to be Chris Evans, who plays a skateboarder-turned-actor. He just played his character in such an awesome light that he even makes him talk like Clint Eastwood. My least favorite is probably the vegan one, who tries to tie not eating more than just meat to being awesome. Yeah, PETA's not high on my list, but oh well. The best part about this whole movie are the video-game style fight scenes. You actually have the Street Fighter \"vs.\" in the middle of the two, and everything is as over the top as a video game. In fact, I saw this movie to be a \"Super Mario Street Fighter\" sort of thing. Scott had to fight five guys and a girl (much like the Koopas, which also one was female) in a form of Mortal Kombat. Heck, they even did a cat fight like Mortal Kombat with a giant mallet. I'm not joking: Ramona pulls a giant war hammer out of her purse. But my favorite part of the movie also dealt with my least favorite ex: Scott Pilgrim challenges him to a bass battle. YES. A BASS BATTLE. As a bassist, my mind was blown. In fact, the music was also pretty cool. If you were to take away the video game look and feel, it would be a romantic comedy...probably without the comedy. So it'd be like everything else. So kudos to the director for giving us something with which we're familiar and telling it to us in a way we've never heard it. What I didn't like is how incredibly ridiculous certain things were, even for a pseudo-video game. There's this one evil ex who makes a big deal about being a vegan that when he drinks a coffee with half-and-half, two cops of vegans take his powers out of nowhere. Out. of. nowhere. In the end, he faces Bowser: Ramona's evil ex Jason Schwartzman. I won't tell you what happens, but the second chance card gets played like only a video game would. He doesn't have much other than he's the head of a record label, but who cares? He's the final boss. Since I never read the graphic novels, I really don't know much about the source material, but from what I do know it seems like the movie's faithful, so if the novel is as epic as the movie was I'll consider reading it. Bottom line: this film is awesome. It's fun, funny, great editing, cinematography, a bit ridiculous at times, but it's a video game worth playing, and you're always rooting for the hero.",

And the acting has humanity and actual emotion in it unlike whatever wins best picture at the Academy Awards. As much as people aren't going to want to admit it, Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World is one of the few movies in recent memory that is relevant, like-able, watchable, and is legitimately hilarious. And that is a testament to how good movies can be!",

It was not due to the gaming references or the corny one liners littered throughout the movie, but rather, the love story itself that was carelessly woven for Scott and Ramona. It's not the emotionally moving, heart felt, passionate sort of love that would move anyone. In fact, it felt selfish and obnoxious. I really felt bad for Knives who seemed more likeable than Ramona, and better fit for Scott. The other characters were barely worth mentioning aside from Scott's gay room-mate who, at-least, brought some comic relief. Either way, the main character himself, Scott, is flat and uninspiring. And the story only got worse whenever the 7 ex-boyfriends were thrown in for good old mindless showdowns that have absolutely nothing to do with what this movie really is: a romantic comedy. Let me repeat this: This is not an action movie. It's for Twilight-look alike, wannabe gamers that give the rest of us a new reason to be ashamed. Maybe one day, someone can make a gamer inspired movie that doesn't make us all look like selfish, unappealing, attention deficient pre-teens.",

The fight scene itself was pretty awesome, considering it was another chance for the audience to get a piece of audio pleasure with the band, but they never really got too in depth into the Ex's.

I'm not really into either, but it was just so clever, entertaining, and funny, that it really doesn't matter.  I think it's quite brilliant how the comic book is translated into a movie.  I loved how the quick little scenes were just like single comic book frames.  It was really well done.  The movie is very incredulous, I did find myself asking \"Really?\" a few times, but you have accept that this movie is far from reality, and enjoy it.",

The setting is also perfect - the overblown story takes place in modest Toronto, though a Toronto where no one breaks the age 30 barrier and high school seems eons away. I'm a bit worried this direct exclusion of age groups is a factor that will deter a large portion of the movie-going crowd.

      "text": "Director Edgar Wright brings Bryan Lee O'Malley's famed comic book character to life with \"Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World\". The movie, of course, tells the story of Scott Pilgrim (Cera), a young musician who must battle all the evil exes of the girl of his dreams, Ramona Flowers (Winstead). First off, try not to take this movie too seriously - because it's not. If you walked into this movie expecting a tour-de-force tale of love, passion, and perseverance you'd be sorely mistaken. This movie is not meant to be thought-provokingly philosophical. It's meant to be fun - and boy is it fun. I had a pretty darn good time watching \"Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World\". The most entertaining quality of this movie is it's special effects. Granted most of it's CGI, it doesn't hinder the entertainment value. I only wish I would've seen this movie on the big screen - it would've been exponentially more fun to watch. Another great quality of the film is that it features a wealth of tongue-in-cheek throwbacks to some of the classic video games of the late 80s and early 90s. A lot of video game cliches make their appearance in this movie and I (being a nerd) found them highly entertaining to spot. The acting is what it is. It's not really anything worthy of note, but it fits the bill for the overall tone of the movie. The same goes for the script, which, for most of the movie, should not be taken seriously. Wright also employed a lot of CGI to really make the film feel like a comic book. I feel that a lot of these techniques were really fresh, innovative, and even, at times, funny. In the end, Edgar Wright's \"Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World\" remains an impressively entertaining adaption of the popular comic book series.",

I'm one of them and this movie was not impressive. The story was trite and silly with unfunny characters who pop in a few good one liners every now and then. The fighting was original and entertaining but did not fit. It seemed like it was thrown in for this-looks-cool reason. The video game references were cute but more silly than artistic.

However some brief moments of sunshine can be seen through Ramona near the end of the film, the music in the film will make you want to rock out, and Kieran Culkin is not to be missed as Scott's gay roommate Wallace Wells.

The world that these people(avatars, really) exist in, can only be the world of virtual reality, where a guy like Scott Pilgrim(Michael Cera) can stand toe-to-toe with anybody, since brawn is irrelevant in the gaming world. Pilgrim embodies the gamer, the stereotypical gamer who plays video games in order to feel powerful. Whereas most films of this ilk require that the hero should train before going into battle, Scott defeats Ramona Flowers' first ex(Matthew Patel, played by Satya Bhabha) without any training, and with relative ease. A narrative preliminary, a trope that was used as recently as John Turteltaub's \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\", exists in \"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World\" too, but it exists extra-diegetically. The training that enables Scott to defeat all of Ramona's exes is part of the film's backstory, translated into video game parlance, backstory means programming, and herein lies the difference between video games and movies, as \"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World\" suggests the interactive quality of the former, because the avatar(the bassist for a rock band(or is that \"Rock Band\"?) and unlikely ladykiller), needs a gamer to do the fighting for him. Nobody on screen seems especially shocked that a man with Scott's physique turned out to be so adept at one-on-one combat; their cipher-like non-reactions to Scott's prodigious fighting ability adds to the virtual reality feel of the diegesis. Everybody comes across as pure character, rather than actual people; puppets being controlled by puppetmasters. While Scott looks like an underdog, he doesn't come across as one, since vulnerability is integral to the underdog's makeup. Instead of shedding blood, the vanquished emit a monetary spray of quarters. Instead of rooting for flesh and blood characters, \"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World\" has the moviegoer rooting for the imaginary gamer, whose wish for a life is fulfilled, as Scott walks off with the girl of his dreams(personally, I would have chosen Knives). In \"Existenz\", the world that Allegra creates goes beyond mere simulacrum, which gives the player the notion that he's getting a life. When Scott says, \"I'm getting a life,\" the film is quietly breaking the fourth wall, because those could be the words of the gamer who lives vicariously through the character he's manipulating.",

Michael Cera is the main cause of this being awesome, blending his dorky cliches with Keanu Reeves's badboy action star persona into a perfect remedy. among the other great performances include Jason Schwartzman and Kieran Culkin, among others.

Wright's first two movies were quite cartoony, this movie is over the edge when it comes to that.  During fight scenes, Scott and his opponent throw powerful punches and are not scratched.  This movie has plenty of eye candy throughout which make the overall experience enjoyable.  One problem with this movie is that it is hard to make unpredictable.  Wright takes this issue and throws it out the window.  The plot has plenty of unpredictable twists that will keep you glued to your seat.  The acting in this movie is phenomenal.  Michael Cera delivers and the wimpy hero and Ramona brings a strong performance as the female protagonist.  This movie is best described as a real-life video game action comedy mashup.  Overall, Wright hit it big with this movie and he shows that you do not have to like video games to like this hilarious movie.",

From the start, this guy has a girlfriend who really loves him, and he ditches her all the sudden cause he likes some other girl more from having a short conversation with her.  We also learn that he was dating the drummer of his band and ditched her too for some reason.  Not to mention he learns that the new girl he wants is a whore.  Doesn't matter, he really likes how she looks or something so he sticks with her.  Seriously?  Random video game references are enough for everyone to ignore the fact that the main character of this movie is a total  jerk who doesn't care about any of the women who have miraculously cared about him?",

I liked how different it was and they used some of the original comic book for some of the montages.

I salute Edgar Wright's attempt to cram 6 books into one movie as if he knew a sequel was highly unlikely for such a bold Indie project, however choosing such a fast pace does effect the movie in bad ways, the main reason being it limits the appeal of an already unique movie even more then if the story had the time of a sequel to develop. Scott and Ramona as characters suffer the most from the pacing as the movie almost completely removes the book story aspects of addressing their pasts, coming to terms with their mistakes and the new responsibilities of adulthood, reducing Scott to little more then a Jerk Jock and Ramona to little more then an indecisive whore. It's the biggest flaw of this movie, what we get instead is characters typical Hollywood style, the main characters magically becoming better people by the end of the movie with little explination and it's I think one of the main reasons for so much hate towards the movie because they have basically watered down the entire point of the story. True the movie is still crammed to the brim with bold in your face visuals, Anime/manga and videogame references at every turn, when it's not overdone like the pointless peeing scene it's an impressive sight to behold, but it's assumbing you can actually recognise the references to appreciate them. For casual movie watchers who have no idea what hadoken, frag, kawaii or other similar lingo means, the movie will leave them scratching their head in frustration around barely even 10 minutes in as they try to follow the fast paced story. The only way they could possibly connect is reading the books first, which I consider a failure, as the film should be able to draw audiences in on it's own merits. No matter how you feel about this movie, it's doomed to a 'cult classic' fate at best, in some ways similar to twilight, but with a fraction of the movie goer profits, which is a shame because the Scott Pilgrim universe has more depth then those glorified vampire romance fanfictions. If Scott pilgrim vs the World is 'self absorbed', then by that logic the Twilight Saga thinks it's the greatest love story ever told.",

By watching thiz film, amazingly I feel like back to become teenager again, with my skate board under my feet and baseball cap on my head. It tells about Scott Pilgrim (Michael Cera) who has a new girlfriend, Ramona Flower (Mary Elizabeth Winstead). Now, he must defeat seven Ramona evil ex-boyfriends in video game style duels. Meanwhile, Scott is also playing in a band called Sex Bob-omb with his friends. The movie directed by Edgar Wright who brought us SHAUN OF THE DEAD (2004) and HOT FUZZ (2007). He is always able to make any comedy to be smart one. On thiz latest feature, there are some unique and hilarious characters, such as: Scott gay roommate Wallace (Kieran Culkin), the annoying Scott ex-girlfriend Knives (Ellen Wong) and Ramona Indian silly ex-boyfriend Matthew Patel (Satya Bhabha). Even more, the movie is surrounded by refreshing Cameo appearances from Anna Kendricks, Jason Schwartzman, Chris Evans, Thomas Jane and our last Superman, Brandon Routh. Michael Cera seems to be a perfect choice for Scott Pilgrim, he does not even have to act so hard for being Scott character. Mary Elizabeth Winstead delivers some cool punk-girl character successfully. The movie apparently based on the first three series of six black-and-white comic strips by Bryan Lee O Malley. The Art Direction is so different and attractive. They use comical fonts to emphasize the sound and the fighting scene is one of my main attentions. The fight scenes are mind-blowing with those graphics and animations, yeah it looks ridiculous sometimes, but surely well-choreographed. Once again, the only way to comprehend thiz movie is by letting yourself being young again. Just to recall how we enjoy adolescence by just living in our own world. Once in awhile, all of us were Scott Pilgrim and only us Vs. The World. Welcome back to MTV generation. For me, thiz movie deserves to receive 1Up and 1000 Combos!

The young mans struggle with love, rock, imagination, competition and growing up was something that I found myself really connecting to in many ways. I often had imagined in my mind many of the things that come to life in the movie while growing up. Having seen the movie many times now I can certainly see that the film isnt perfect, the girlfriend character Ramona is a bit of a bore, and Scotts relationship with Ramona isnt as deep as what it should perhaps be. The pacing also becomes in the later part of the movie a struggle going from fight to fight. The story of the book is more concerned with the comedy of Scott growing up and finding his way in life over a 2 year period and not the condensed fighting that the movie concentrates on. The visuals and sound are nothing short of brilliant and succeed at the highest level. The comedy is also entertaining and there are some great lines and movie moments. I wished that there was that extra 10% of this movie to make it a great film, but what it is good non the less. Thumbs up!",

Scott Pilgrim vs. the World is two hours of nostalgic video-game fun with awesome battles, goofy characters, and even the occasional hilarious line.  Michael Cera does what he does best, the geeky guy falling for the hot girl, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead does the aforementioned hot girl perfectly.  They're backed up by Kieran Culkin, whom I think was probably the funniest character of the film, and several short but great appearances by Anna Kendrick.  The only flaw that Scott Pilgrim might have is that it can never be taken seriously, so much so that it never even takes itself seriously... but that's the entire point of the film.  It's meant to be two hours of pure, delightful enjoyment, and that's exactly what it is.",

It has 6 books and they are all wrapped up into this movie!. and man it is groundbreaking. i Enjoyed the books and even more the movie. The cast is just perfect, they all fit in so perfectly. and many people criticized Michael Cera for playing Scott but after reading the Books and watching the movie over 10 TIMES! I honestly can't think of anyone doing a better job than he did. Everybody else from Kieran Culkin to Mary Elizabeth Winstead were great. Edgar Wright the director did an AWESOMETACULAR job. The pacing is perfect, the action scenes, the comedy, it was right ON!. Mostly everything from the books Transcended onto the movie except for a few scenes and characters. BUT nothing to BIG. THIS MOVIE IS ONE that you'll probably never see again, or maybe you will. ITS ORIGINAL AND PERFECT. If you're a fan of Scott pilgrim Books THEN YOU'LL LOVE IT! 10/10 THE MOVIE OF MY GENERATION.

Love for every cheesy moment of nerdy quirks that it celebrates, and love for its own characters and dickish protagonist.

      "text": "Scott Pilgrim vs. The World is a film adaptation of one of the most successful teen novels of all time. The story and film have gained an almost cult like following, and I had to see what all the fuse was about. The truth is, that this particular films represents everything that is wrong with our society and youth culture in general. Scott Pilgrim is the kind of guy who likes to label everyone and everything, but worse than that, he rants in circles, using constant innuendos, that only a fourteen year old would understand. The story isn't even that unique or special, as the film moves at lightning speed, which is slightly slower than the speed at which it's star, Michael Cera, delivers his lines. I really felt as though my head was spinning, with a mix of slang and new terminology, that simply didn't make any sense to me. As far as the story goes, it's just another modern love story, featuring a lovable loser in love, which was completely unbelievable. The reason is Michael Cera, who seemingly plays the exact same role in every film. He's this nerdy, uncomfortable guy, trying all these awkward ways to get girls to fall for him, and it never works, possibly because he is one of the most feminine and closeted actors out there today. I generously gave this film 1 star, because I actually did enjoy Scott Pilgrim's band, but aside from that, this film is a complete waste of time. It's star is unbelievable, it's story is overly complicated, and the dialogue is arguably the worst I have ever heard. Scott Pilgrim vs. The World may be your teenage daughters favorite movie, but if you're older than sixteen, you're going to want to skip this one.",

Edgar Wright's style is very abrasive here, since he basically just made it a video game/comic book that was made into a movie, but it really has a very cool and unique look to it that really made the film true eye candy at times. The characters are all pretty well written, though there are some things that really did not work writing wise and I do wish the script was better at different times. The acting was very good from everyone, really loved Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Anna Kendrick here, in particular.

The humor works very well and there is no bad actor or performance in the entire cast. The only negative point were the first 20 minute of the film. It started slow and with some awkward scenes. Many people (some of my friends too) turned away from this movie and missed probably one of the best movies ever made. Because of this I give 9/10 (The mentioned negative point is sadly valid enough).",

And to this day I still hear 'fans' of the movie talk about how it's the greatest video game movie ever made. This isn't true. And if you choose to watch the movie, you will see that nothing is good about it. It's awkward, stilted, not funny, and offers nothing of value. It can't even be considered so bad it's good. It's just bad. Although I am primarily a video game critic, and an exceedingly popular, well known, and respected one at that, I feel as if I step forward to call this movie's fans for what they are: Hipsters are who are trying to pretend to be nerds. Let me give you an example of what this terrible film does. So Scott is hanging out with his bros and his lesbian girlfriend or whatever and his psycho high school girlfriend pops in up in the window. The Zelda item theme plays. This is supposed to be a bad thing, why is that jingle playing now? It makes absolutely no sense and was clearly only thrown in because hipsters love Zelda, even though they don't play the games. A better video game movie? Probably Wreck it Ralph. Or maybe even the Super Mario Brothers movie. Even that film had Bob-ombs who did what they supposed to do. Scott Pilgrim is not worth anyone's time. It's an unfocused mess that doesn't really have anything going for it.",
