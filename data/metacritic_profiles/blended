      "text": "At least it's a little bit satisfying to see Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore trying to make connection after a very good \"The Wedding Singer\" and a good \"50 First Dates\" but Blended it's just about stupidity and more stupidity, it's kind of fun but with no sense. Is an average 2010's Mr. Sandler's movie after all. Don't get me wrong, I laughed but I felt totally weird after finishing the movie. It starts promisingly but it gets dull and typical and commercial \"click stuff\" (42%)",

      "text": "Sometimes I think critics have created a mindset they can never leave. A good example of this is that all adam sandler movies suck. Now he has had his up and downs in terms of movies. He has mostly had awful movies recently I am not going to lie. I walked into this movie with no expectation at all whatsoever. The first half of this movie was awful. There was a cute scene where adam sandler and his daughter were having a bonding moment watching cartoons in the bedroom but this scene wasn't until after we get introduced to the horrendous kid Brandon of Lauren who love ladies and lots of inappropriate stuff. the other kid was not so bad. However I wanted to punch some sense Into Brandon face. He just was not funny at all. Fast forward to the part where Jim and Lauren unexpectedly meet up in Africa and are forced to share the romantic suite. From here we meet the hilarious terry crews who shows up at the most random parts of the movie and has his choir sing and act on everything that's going on at random moments in the film. There were a couple of other cute scenes where Lauren and Jim bond with the others kids and terry crews makes one final hilarious appearance before the end. there are many other sweet moments shared between the families and to be hones this movie is miles better than pixels, grownups jack and Jill etc. Is it perfect no. Does the comedy hit the spot every time no. In fact some of the comedy is downright horrible. This is the closest I have seen sandler try to be within the kid friendly range sense bedtime stories. but the biggest problem I had with blended is that It can not decide what is wants to be. A juvenile comedy, or a family friendly comedy. Is worth buying no. Renting? yea. Check it out and see what you think. Overall blended shines in sports but tends to be overshadowed by lame juvenile humor that keeps this movie from being great.",
