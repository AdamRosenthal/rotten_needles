The cast is very strong, particularly the connections of the family are very believable and adds to the tension. However, this movie doesn't try to force itself on being a horror-fest, the director clearly was having fun with this shoot. This movie is campy at the right moments just as it throws in the surprises and jump scares with nearly perfect timing. Although the home invasion premise of the movie something that we've seen a lot before in recent horror or thriller type movies, I cant think of a movie within the past several years that does it with even remotely the thrills that You're Next manages. I can see this one becoming a cult classic, probably something that we'll see Hollywood remake in about 25 years or so and hate the remake because it will miss the damn point. The twist in the final moments of the movie was well done, although predictable if you are a seasoned horror buff.",

The movie also possesses an entertaining sense of dark humor, invigorating a generic storyline that feels revitalized.

Most reviews are mediocre I agree, it is somehow cliched but it is more twisted, entertaining and funny than cliched, cheesy and corny.

      "text": "After I saw the trailer when I went to see the movie \"The Conjuring\", I wanted to see the movie so bad. Well I just saw it the same day I wrote this review and it was good. There were some other people that were saying \"Worst movie ever!\" Good horror sequences and unique. I mean, in what other movie do you get to see murderers wear animal masks? You have Ghostface from \"Scream\" wearing a screaming crying mask, Michael Myers from \"Halloween\" wearing a ghost white mask and your Jason from \"Friday the 13th\" wearing your old classic hockey mask. Well the beginning of the movie actually starts with a man and a woman in a house in the forest when you meet fox-face. That's my nickname for him. The words \"You're Next\" written with blood on the sliding glass door was a good job. After that beginning scene, you actually meet the father and the mother of the family. The problem though is that the mother is probably the most overly dramatic character in the movie. She is kind of corny. After everyone arrived at the house, she said like a little speech that was kinda awkward.  After she heard a huge bang and some footsteps above she panics and says to her husband that someone is upstairs. So she says that they should leave but he says that he is going to check it out. She refuses but after he gets a weapon, she finally says yes. It turns out that the noise was caused by their son Crispian. It was the next night that the hunters attack. The actors do a good job except Erin and OH MY GOD she is an idiot. When Aimee got her throat slit by a razor sharp wire right outside the door, she just stood there with a bored-like expression on her face. Not to mention that she is also so dull. She never amazes you and not to mention that she is transformed from a random girl that is trapped in a house to a Arnold Schwarzenegger commando. Fights back to the hunters and not to mention that sometimes she just stands in one place like a statue. Enough about the characters. What about the setting? Fantastic. The house is a nice touch and the corridors are tight and raises the suspension. There is a part when fox-face crept out from under the bed and just not so stealth killed someone (who I am not going to spoil).  The sound is also fresh and hits at the perfect time either after a kill or when a hunter pops out from a corner.  For my full written review, check out http://vgasgames.weebly.com/",

Even the murderers are allowed a certain psychological depth, and this makes what they do all the more horrifying. I also appreciated how realistic the victims' behavior was; that is, much of what they did was stupid and irrational, but in a very believable, sympathetic way. Most people would lose their minds in such a situation. Director Adam Wingard gets this, and as such his movie comes across as something more than a cheap slasher flick. It expertly straddles the line between verisimilitude and snuff, which is what the best of the neo-horror films aim to do.",

It was a good time at the movies, simple as that. If you enjoy the evil dead films or slasher films that aren't completely serious then you will enjoy it. If your looking for a movie to scare you to death then look somewhere else. I recommend You're Next but only if you can enjoy a little fun in your horror. 6.5/10",

      "text": "Fast paced, vicious and utterly fun, You're Next is a master-class in horror film making thanks to a fresh concept and a director willing to see it through to the bitter end, the bitter fantastic end. When a family gathers for an anniversary celebration at a country house away from society they find themselves under siege by a group of sociopathic attackers wearing animal masks. However the attackers and the guests soon realize they should be afraid of one of the guests more as they prove remarkably adept at killing people. While some of the performances in the film are dire it also features a standout performance by Sharni Vinson whose character is a wonderful change of pace to the conventional horror movie females, sure she does about the same quota of killing, maybe even lightly more, but You're Next manages to make it seem more realistic. Her status as a masculine female seems assured but the film doesn't ever change her, she is always presented as feminine, feminine force capable of some truly devastating things (her skill with a meat tenderizer alone is worth the price of admission). The film manages to present each of its characters as people even though some are clearly going to suffer the fate of dying early on. Everyone feels like equals as each and everyone of them puts their own effect on the story and the overall feel of this awe inspiring horror flick. While some of the violence takes a turn towards the fantastical as people survive the most disgusting of injuries, its all in the name of entertainment and that's what You're Next is, grade A popcorn entertainment.",

The acting is much to be desired, but Sharni Vinson is a strong female protagonist that you root for. The repeated track 'Looking for the Magic' by the Dwight Twilley Band is great & the genius synth score feels like a throwback to a John Carpenter film.

But i do have to say it's a home invasion thriller it's fun the effects are a kick ass fun that editor/director Adam Wingard really made great shots and cgi it's brilliant. Grade A-",

But, the movie is not without imperfections. Some of the decisions the characters take are questionable and the movie is at times pretty unbelievable. Overall, it was a fun surprise and an entertaining movie.",

I wondered at times where the story was headed and as with most in this genre the acting leaves something to be desired.  The plot had some huge gaping holes no surprise here as most do.  Still with all that being said it was watchable and it did make you wonder why everyone was being killed.  I also have to admit there were times in the movie that had its effect which means it made me jump out of my seat  or had me turn my head due to gore.  If your a fan of this type of movie it is above average and better than most with a few twists and turns.  Good for a scary movie night if you haven't seen it as of yet.",

It is less of a horror movie and more of a dark comedy, like \"American Psycho\" from 2000. It has a lot of witty dialogue and a new take on the home invasion genre. However, the movie does feel stale at times and the killers aren't creepy enough considering they show their real faces multiple times. Overall, You're Next is a solid, entertaining movie. 7/10",

At first I thought it was going to be one of those slow building horror film's that ends in one twisted, violent displays of violence but \"You're Next\" keeps a pretty chilling, steady pace of non-stop suspense that had me on edge. I have never enjoyed cursing at the people on the screen as I did with this film. I never really noticed any moments where the story became stagnant. Even after the mid-film reveal as to the plot I still found the remaining section of \"You're Next\" just as thrilling as the first half.",
