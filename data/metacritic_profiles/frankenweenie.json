First we have the signature character of this director, who in this case is a misunderstood boy without friends, although here is expanded to other people of the story, unlike most of Burton pictures. In addition to Victor, there is Elsa (animated Winona Ryder), Mr. Rzykruski (animated Vincent Price), Edgar, Weird Girl, Toshiaki, Bob and Nassor; all these characters are very well physically constructed and have a defined personality. Second, the vision of the science that brings Tim Burton to the plot is awesome, and it is defined by two things that are said by Mr. Rzykruski: people like what science gives them but not the questions that science asks; and, science is not good or bad, but it can be used in both ways. Third, the idea of gothic mixed with science gives the film a fresh air and it is reflected in the moment when the other boys have their experiments. The thing here is that with these series of creatures, we notice the different approaches to science: love of Victor, ignorance of Edgar, over-confidence of Toshiaki, superiority of Nassor, fear of Bob and accident of Weird Girl. Other great things on this movie are the use of Frankenstein elements and the outstanding application of camera, in the picture are noticeable transitions from one images to another, flip over (360 turn) and the famous vertigo effect, formed by simultaneously dolly in and zoom out. Tim Burton could have a perfect film, but the end should be different.",

The stop motion animation is first rate.  The story is clever, especially when the animals get morphed together.  I like the decision to make it in black and white.  Good enough for repeated viewings, so I will be purchasing the blu ray when it's released.  This is my favorite Burton film since the underrated \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\".",

Frankenweenie is a very different, emotional and a meaningful film, it has the strong message which is meant to be delivered to viewers of all ages as it discusses the emotional attachment, the utilization of science and the jealousy. The film is about a boy named Victor whose dog 'Sparky' dies in an accident and then he brings Sparky back to life through science. The whole concept and plot of the film pays a direct homage to Frankenstein and it has been incorporated properly, just the right amount was needed and Burton did a great job. Animation is really, really amazing, I have never watched a black and white animation before and this was a new experience for me which proved to be really great. Voice acting is wonderful as always, the accents have been used in a real manner especially Toshiaki's accent, which made me laugh throughout the film. The major reasons why I'm giving it 8 marks are its freshness, originality and Burton's hard work. This is definitely a strong contender for awards season as it has already won so many critics awards and I wouldn't be surprised if it also wins the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature because it totally deserves it.",

      "text": "As a fan of Tim Burton, I was looking forward to Frankenweenie, but when I saw it, I hate to admit that I was unfortunately disappointing. The movie was good enough to keep me awake, but it just wasn't good, at all. It did have an interesting premise, but I didn't care about the characters, the movies script is a little on the generic side and it just BORED me to death. I seriously did not like the movie, at all. And I know that people are going to give me heat for giving such an overrated movie a 4 out of 10, but it's my review. I just personally hated the movie, but I won't give it a negative rating because the acting was actually legitimately good, but other than that, the movie was not enjoyable, AT ALL. By far, Tim Burton's worst film. I don't know why its so overrated.",

      "text": "I love Tim Burton, but this film isn't worthy of the ratings that it has been given. The film is somewhat likable but I have to say, Tim Burton wil eventually end up like Adam Sandler, he made some great movies before (Edward Scissorhands, Nightmare Before Christmas, Batman [1989]) then he made some good or okay movies (Dark Shadows, 9) and now we have \"Frankenweenie.\" For Tim Burton, this film seems like bottom of the barrel, he can do so much better than this. I didn't like \"Frankenweenie,\" not just because I know that Tim Burton can do so much better, but the film just wasn't all that good.",

Good thing I chose to watch it, because the film is pretty great! Beautifully animated, great characters, charming, heartfelt, and well-written, this is Tim Burton being Tim Burton. Many say that Tim was on the decline with films like \"Alice in Wonderland\" and \"Dark Shadows,\" but don't worry, Tim can still direct, and \"Frankenweenie\" proves that. It's a wonderful animated film for kids and adults alike!",
