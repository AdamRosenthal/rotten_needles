Then in 2013, a bizarre discussion on an episode of Smith's SModcast podcast hastily inspired him to write and direct Tusk, a high-concept movie (in more ways than one, I'm sure) that can be summarized with one sentence: Los Angeles podcaster visits Manitoba and gets kidnapped by a lunatic who turns him into a walrus. Still with me? Smith, during the film's second TIFF screening I attended after its world premiere the night before, joked that he had reached the point in his career where \"I don't give a fu*k anymore\", but just because Smith has reached a bitter crossroads in his career that's resulted in quite literally one of the worst movie experiences I've ever sat through doesn't mean you should also be subjected to the man's lack of impulse control.",

The movie tries to be funny and scary, but is neither. Die hard Kevin Smith fans will enjoy it, but it isn't a good movie at all. The pre-climax scene is disturbing, but that doesn't make it scary at all. It seems more like one of those movies that seemed great on paper, but doesn't look good on the screen at all. The movie is about a podcaster named Wallace Bryton ( (Justin Long) who is a total jerk and has no regard for the audience he talks about in his podcast, but goes to Canada to interview the Kill Bill Kid who had a terrible accident. When the inital meeting doesn't turn out as expected, the podcaster finds a letter written by a mysterious adventurer who lives in the middle of nowhere in Canada. From there, the podcaster arrives to the mansion where the mysterious old man adventurer Howard Howe (Michael Parks)  talks about his stories and how he befriends a walrus. The old man is obsessed with everything about walruses. The podcaster drinks tea with the old man and soon realizes that his tea has been posioned. Then, flashbacks go to the happy days of Wallace and his beautiful girlfriend Ally Leon (Genesis Rodriguez) before all the torture begins. Rodriguez is the only good part of the movie. She plays a really great part.",

Even Johnny Depp, who gives a bizarre interpretation of a French Canadian detective doesn't use his name in the credits. It's just a disappointing film all the way around. It does have good make-up effects though.",

The actors all put on good performances and even in the most sinister and sickly situations, they still manage to bring humor out of it. The movie manages to pull jokes throughout but they're far between, and most of it is in the first half. All-around, just a silly movie that brings some laughs and evokes some gags.",
