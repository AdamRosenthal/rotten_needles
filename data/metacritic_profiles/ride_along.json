I didn't think the first Ride Along was funny at all, yes it gave me a few laughs but I find Kevin Hart annoying and unfunny but Ice Cube saved the mediocre action buddy-cop movie. But now we have a sequel just what this stupid mediocre action-comedy franchise needs. Let me tell you that this sequel is not good at all, the gags are unfunny (but some do work). Ben Barber (once again played by Kevin Hart) a former high school security guard who is a month out of the police academy and a week away from marrying James' sister (Tika Sumpter). He wants to be a detective like James (played again by Ice Cube), his future brother-in-law, James reluctantly takes Ben to Miami to follow up on a lead that's connected to a drug ring. The case brings them to a homicide detective (Olivia Munn) and a computer hacker (Ken Jeong) who reveals evidence that implicates a respected businessman. It's up to James and Ben to prove that charismatic executive Antonio Pope (Benjamin Bratt) is actually a violent crime lord who rules southern Florida's drug trade. Munn and Jeong shouldn't be in this movie because both of them are talented, and they can't save this film either. Director Tim Story directs once again, and the direction is once again terrible. Bratt as the villain is okay, he did an okay job. Jeong isn't funny here, he deserves better material. If your a fan of the first one, go see it! But for the rest stay away, this film isn't worth the ride. Let's not hope their not making another one of these movies. 2 out of 5",

This sequel outshines the original in the comedy as Ride Along 2 is Funnier and crazier although some of the jokes feel forced and lazy and the first half of the movie is rather dull but picks up fast.Ken Jeong is the best new character this movie has and he has some great scenes as well as Tika Sumpter who plays Kevin Hart's girlfriend who wasn't in the film as much but was good in the film as Ben's girlfriend.The villain in this film is rather generic and cliche but is a better villain than the first movie, but if you don't mind clich\u00e9 villains you won't mind.So overal Ride Along 2 is not as good as the first Ride Along but is a satisfactory sequel, a good popcorn flick,if you're looking for something deeper in this film you won't find it as the film has weak character growth, but no  the less Ride Along 2 has great comedy, some wild action and if you can ignore some bad CGI and weak characters you will have a great time.",

This movie isn\u2019t funny at all most of the jokes were flat. It even had a terrible way of editing just like the first one. The only thing that was interesting in the movie was the car chase which was really unique and enjoyable. The villain was god awfully terrible and cliched.In the end Ride Along 2 is a very forgettable movie with Hart trying hard to make people laugh but at this point people are getting tired of kevin Hart\u2019s comedic movies.",
