Friedberg and Seltzer still fail to understand how to make the comedy work and instead populate their spoof with dated pop culture references, cheap toilet humor, obvious jokes and a few examples of horribly bad miscasting. There are many potential jokes to be had with source material like this to riff on but the script instead harps on the same things again and again which results in an irritatingly one-note spoof that fails far off the mark.

In \"Eclipse\", the bedsprings go untested, as Bella listens to Edward prattle on about chaperoned strolls and iced tea on the porch, in which the vampire's antiquated notions regarding courtship, for my money, is far funnier than any of the comic bits that spoofs the insanely successful \"Twilight\" films; the \"Star Wars\" for girls. When Mel Brooks satirized the legendary space opera trilogy back in 1987, some people wondered if \"Spaceballs\" arrived too late. Relevance is obviously not an issue here. With \"Vampires Suck\", it's a matter of being too soon, since episodes four and five, so to speak, are both in their various states of gestation. Why couldn't the industry allow Stephanie Meyer's legions of fans the luxury of loving Bella and her fetish for interspecies guys a little while longer without having to desmysitfy the romance for them? Why make them feel stupid? Team Edward and Team Jacob, in the midst of breaking the fourth wall, fighting among themselves at the film's outset to reflect the pandemonium surrounding the fantastical men in Bella's charmed life, should break the wall further by converging on the filmmaker for making such a witless and insulting film. A glittering, pasty-faced vampire and an Indian afflicted with a serious case of werewolf gigantism are no laughing matters for the true believers. And even if you were against the team expansion of 2007(the release year for \"Twilight\"), when Edward and Jacob joined the filmic league of monsters, these lame ringers are no match as objects of ridicule when compared to the sight of Robert Pattinson and Taylor Lautner.",

Naturellement, tenter de tenir et d'encha\u00eener les gags \u00e0 la Scary Movie pendant plus d'une heure rel\u00e8ve de la mission impossible et se vautre dans l'humour vid\u00e9ogag comme un gros lard dans la piscine. Assur\u00e9ment b\u00e2cl\u00e9e et sans inspiration (comme son mod\u00e8le), cette bien p\u00e2le caricature ne constitue qu'un aper\u00e7u de la c\u00e9l\u00e8bre saga de mongoliens.",
