      "text": "Some comedies are hilarious, others are down right stupid, and then there is the story of Rich Johnson (Cam Gigandent). Like most men, Rich only thinks with his penis, and it often gets him into trouble, so one night, Rich makes a wish that his penis would leave him alone, and that's exactly what it does. Rich's penis detaches, and comes to life in the form of a walking, talking, human being. In the beginning, this film is an absolute riot, but how many penis jokes can you squeeze into a 90 minute film? Eventually Bad Johnson deteriorates into an eighth graders favorite movie, and becomes really tiresome, but in the insanity, something emerges, (besides Rich's penis), Cam Gigandent. I've seen Gigandent around, and he's usually playing the good looking guy, who's roles really doesn't have much substance, until now. As is the case with most actors, it takes time to find their niche, but Gigandent's may very well be comedy. He was the level headed one, who really blurts out the hysterical line when it is sorely needed, and he was far better than Nick Thune, the man who literally was playing a penis. Bad Johnson isn't the kind of film you'll want to see twice, the jokes are old before the film is even over, but if you're looking for a few good, cheap laughs, this film is absolutely perfect.",

      "text": "For the most part, the movie is trying to be really rude, crude and it succeeds. However, the movie is not that funny, it is for the most part creative and original (if you can get pass some cliches) but it falls flat, comedy wise. Bad Johnson is entertaining with some good acting, but it is not a good comedy nor a dramedy. So if you are looking for something similar to The Hangover, This is the end where both are creative, you can watch Neighbors which is better than Bad Johnson. But if you are looking for something really crude, filled with sexuality, basically a popcorn B movie on a Friday night you can just watch this movie. Never take it seriously!",
