If the movie just stopped there, it would already be a comic hit, but the jokes come dangerously non-stop with the evil Earl at the helm of the Rapture's aftermath.  It is true that a few quips are sophomoric and there are lots of 4-letter words, but that works in the context of a plot where wickedness envelopes the planet and those left behind adjust to the new norm with a bizarrely hilarious complacence.  Beware of this evil misadventure since you might very well laugh yourself to death! (I nearly did.) While this flick goes well with beer and buddies, it is not recommended for those who are convinced that the earth has corners and has only been around for 6,000 years.",

      "text": "A solid cast and a promising, funny opening 20 or so minutes are all but squandered as soon as Craig Robinson's Anit-Christ officially makes his entrance into the film. It's not necessarily his fault, his foul-mouthed, man-child of a character is just severely underwritten, barely qualifying as a character and more a machine that spits out the same three lines ad nauseum, with only slight alterations to their structure. If he was a minor character, not a big deal, but Rapture-Palooza instantly becomes entirely about him the moment he steps on the scene. Craig Robinson deserves better material. Then again, no character in the film is particularly well-written (another victim of poor-writing is Ana Gasteyer, forced to screech and cry her way through some seriously unamusing scenes), but there are a few standout performers who elevate their one-note personas above their thankless characterizations. Rob Huebel, Thomas Lennon, Ken Jeong, and Paul Scheer are the only reasons to bother watching the second half of the film, as seemingly every funny thing the writer (Chris Matheson) could think of is frontloaded in the first twenty minutes. Paul Middleditch, the director, might deserve more of the blame though. His lack of experience with comedy and obvious over-reliance on his performers may be what truly undermined a decent script. In any case, a much better, similarly themed recent film to watch would be Seeking a Friend for the End of the World. If you need to watch Rapture-Palooza I would suggest only watching it if you're incredibly stoned, but it's instantly forgettable either way.",

The film has some of the best comic actors in this generation, Craig Robinson is brilliant as usual and the supporting cast are excellent especially the always funny and underrated Rob Huebel. Anna Kendrick is gorgeous and plays her character very well. It has it's problems and some of the jokes fall flat, especially the talking crows which got old very fast. If you like films such as The Other Guys & Hot Tub Time Machine then this could be the film for you. It's not as polished or as funny as most Judd Apatow comedies but it is a very easy and fun film, It's also well paced. In conclusion it's a good movie, obviously not for everyone. After seeing the low rating I went in with low expectations but I was pleasantly surprised. It wasn't marketed very well and that probably didn't help matters either.",

This would have been a more acceptable fail if Paul Middleditch worked with some unknown actors. I mean, where's the fun in watching Craig Robinson ad-libbing the dialogue of a senseless man-child beast? And an emotional Ana Gasteyer from the time you see her until you stop seeing her  why is her character even there? And Anna Kendrick! That role should have been given to some struggling actress wanting to hit the big screen! Seriously! She is a great actor, and seeing her deliver this role with no sense of urgency is really unforgivable! The plot is going nowhere and the only performance I enjoyed was from John Francis Daley. At least his character is trying to make it through the apocalypse, and trying to save the one he loves. At least that makes sense. Oh and by the way, the whole movie is so passionately offensive in it's delivery of Christian theology.",
