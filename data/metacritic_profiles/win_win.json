      "text": "With his team mired in last place, Morris Buttermaker(Walter Matthau), the beer-swilling coach of the most incompetent Little League baseball team imaginable, is not above using desperate measures to improve his players' fortunes. Buttermaker wants to win, badly, and he knows that the struggling team's chances rests in the hands of his pretty daughter's ability to recruit Kelly Leak(Jackie Earle Haley), so he drives Amanda(Tatum O'Neal) to the arcade where negotiations take place over a competitive game of air hockey. The girl loses, much to her father's considerable irritation, especially since she has to date the power-hitting righty blessed with speed an a cannon for an arm, as part of the terms of the deal. But despite the apparently fruitless outcome, Kelly, who looks old enough to shave, is still joining the team, exactly what the rough-edged boy wanted all along, haunting the periphery of the ballpark like he did from atop his motorbike on a daily basis. It's a win-win situation for all three parties involved. Partly because he smokes, Buttermaker expresses a leeriness about Amanda's upcoming social engagement with Kelly, since only punks up to no good smoke, which is why in \"Win Win\"(a film that bears a passing resemblance to Michael Ritchie's \"The Bad News Bears\"), Jackie(Amy Ryan), due to concerns over her young daughter's safety, locks the basement door on Kyle(Alex Shaffer), associating the unwelcome guest's nicotine habit with Eminem. Far from being a pool cleaner, Mike Flaherty(Paul Giamatti) practices the law, but on account of the downward turn in economic growth, clients are hard to come by, a deriving materialization that could put the firm and middle-class lifestyle that his profession provides at risk. As a sideline gig, Mike oversees a losing high school wrestling team which the filmmaker introduces at the outset of \"Win Win\" with transient scenes showing the coach's umbrage toward his young student-athletes as a sort of punctuation for everything that's going wrong with the counselor's life. Every bit as bad as the Bears, the filmmaker gets no comic mileage and levity from the talentless New Providence High wrestlers, whose incompetence, rather than being a consistent source of easy howlers, only serves to exacerbate Mike's already-heightened financial anxieties, for the reason that the lawyer's failure to drum up business through a fresh infusion of new clients is compounded by his failure at coaching a solitary win. The filmmaker understands that our economy is no laughing matter. On paper, \"Win Win\" has the makings of an inspirational sports movie, especially during the intervening time when Kyle transforms the Pioneers overnight  into a squad other schools have to reckon with, and he himself, an up-and-coming champion seeking redemption. \"Win Win\", however, narratively speaking, is much more sophisticated than, for starters, Howard Becker's \"Vision Quest\", inasmuch as the feel-good genre to a large extent gets installed by the ambitious filmmaker as a McGuffin. Strapped for cash, Mike commits a potential disbarment-causing breech of ethics, when in his capacity as the legal guardian of a client(Burt Young), he manipulates the dementia-afflicted old man into taking up residence at a nursing home, while pocketing the money with the court's understanding that Leo would be supervised from his own house. In actuality, \"Win Win\" is a moral thriller, epitomized by the pointed existence of a faulty boiler whose clanging noises represents the cacophony in the lawyer's tell-tale mind. Just like the furnace, Mike knows that the scam has the potential to blow up his practice in an instant. How Kyle performs at the wrestling tournament is not the film's climax; it's merely a byproduct of the explosion that occurs when Cindy(Melanie Lynskey), Kyle's mom, steps forward to claim her father's monthly stipend, and finds the bombshell in the court transcript. It all but subjugates the wrestling subplot to irrelevancy. The film's real and pressing subject is how greed isn't exclusive to just the fabulously wealthy. The deregulation of ethical standards has become a state of mind that encompasses us all, even a nice guy like Mike. The filmmaker, above all else, makes a salient point about money being a drug, a narcotic that is every bit as potent as the one Kyle's mother went to rehab for. \"Win Win\" uses this dialectic to witty use. Comparable to the scene in Ryan Fleck's \"Half Nelson\"(a wrestling hold, it should be noted) where Dan Dunne(Ryan Gosling) tells his student's uncle, a drug pusher, to back-off from Drey(Shareeka Epps), despite the fact that the teacher himself is a user, Mike encourages Cindy to leave her son alone, even though the corrupt lawyer is in no real moral position to do so. He makes more errors than the Bears shorstop Tanner Boyle. \"Win Win\" is not \"The Bad News Pioneers\"; it's \"Mike Flaherty: The Smartest Guy in the Room\".",

      "text": "We live in an era that produces films not by standards of quality, but quantity. We have endless sequels and unspeakable remakes year after year. My God-- a remake of \"Red Dawn\"? Who was fighting for this to be remade? So when a subtle and delightful film like \"Win Win\" comes around, it gives you hope in Hollywood, and reminds you of the greatness of the film medium. \"Win Win\" isn't a straight-up sports movie--though it does offer a few vivid scenes of triumph and loss on the mat. It doesn't obey the conventional rhythms of the genre. Tom McCarthy's \"Win Win\" sees Paul Giamatti star as Mike Flaherty, a struggling lawyer and part-time high school wrestling coach. Only trying to make ends meet financially, Mike makes some ambiguous business deals that ultimately lands him a star-studded wrestler without parents. Being the considerate family they are, Mike and his wife Jackie Flaherty (Amy Ryan), take this confused teenager in. One thing leads to the next as the addition of Kyle (Alex Shaffer), on this seemingly hopeless wrestling team, proves to be successful. The once tension-filled family gets put to rest with the transformation in personality of Kyle. Then one day, Kyle's mother shows up just fresh out of drug rehab. Kyle despises her and she has merely returned into his life to pick up a long awaited paycheck from his grandfather (plot logistics that reveal to much of the story for me to explain). She makes plenty of threats, which evidently puts everything created by the Flaherty's and Kyle, in jeopardy. \"Win Win\" is a small--though emotionally touching character study. It's grounded and rarely steps out of the director's comfort zone. McCarthy has a very precise and intricate directorial style that makes all of his character human beings who are easy to relate to. Still, none of the film's accolades could not be given without help from the slew of great performers in display here. Amy Ryan as the hard-nosed mother, Jeffrey Tambor and Terry Delfino as assistant wrestling coaches with two completely different styles, Burt Young as the grandfather who just wants to go home, and Melanie Lynskey as Kyle's mother who has returned purely for the money--these performers are very good. However, it's Paul Giamatti and first time actor Alex Shaffer who give the film its gravitas. Giamatti is quite simply one of the best working actors we have in the entertainment business. Yet, it could be Alex Shaffer who gives the most impressive performance. Having never acted on screen before, he manages to give Kyle some emotional empathy. Shaffer's performance appears to be given so effortlessly, and by the end of the movie, he is completely convincing in the role. \"Win Win\" gathers all the strands (the illegal trusteeship, the wrestling team, the hazardous rapts boiler, the wrestling, the rehabbing mother, Jackie finding out about her husband's misdeeds) and wraps everything up a little to neatly. Everything clicks into place--and life seldom has uncomplicated endings. In his short career (The Station Agent, The Visitor), McCarthy has established himself as a craftsman of conventionally quirky pictures that are entirely about ingratiating themselves with the audience. He wins this fight.",
