Heck, they're now the highest grossing movie franchise EVER now! However, all this   doesn't mean that they rush their movies, nor do they act like they just want money for their movies. They put such care and attention into their films for all their devoted fans. Guess what? X-Men Days of Future Past is just like the other Marvel films in terms of quality, if not better! At the core of every Marvel movie, their true genre is action. One-on-one fight scenes with hero and villain, countless numbers of structures falling down, explosions (not to a Michael Bay degree though), it's awesome action. So of course, DoFP has amazing action with all the X-Men. I loved seeing their mutant powers come to life and then watching in awe as they kicked ass. Speaking of the characters and their powers, all of them are truly brought to life. While the acting is nothing revolutionary, everybody still does a fine job. I especially liked Michael Fassbender's performance as Magneto. He really acts like a menace sometimes (which he will do more than often in the movie), and there's not a better pick for a character that's supposed to be cruel than him. The title of the movie gives you some hints about the storyline, right? Well, what happens is that the world is getting eaten up by the Sentinels, and they are still trying to kill every mutant they can find. The X-Men soon figure out someone must go into the past with Kitty's powers to change what happened. I will not lie, you will have to pay attention most of the time. It wasn't a problem for me, though. While it's not the most original Marvel storyline you've ever heard, it's still interesting enough to keep you entertained. In terms of flaws, I really couldn't detect any. Does that mean it's a 10 out of 10 masterpiece (12 Years a Slave is considered that score imo)? No. Yet still, DoFP is still gonna be one of best Marvel movies you've seen. All these positives really add up into being a great time at the movies. It's worth it. GO SEE IT!",

And if you think about it, they are veritably ruling the film world.  Look at the ensemble of actors in this movie.  Where other than a Robert Altman movie are you going to find a cast of people together like Ian McKellan, Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Jennifer Lawrence, James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Ellen Page - the list goes on and on.  What's more remarkable is that this cast works deftly together in a film that could have been a sloppy disaster.  Time-travel movies when done right are some of the most intriguing movies ever - but if done wrong, they are excruciating.  Luckily, Days of Future Past gets it all right, and the only drawback is all the expository, supporting dialogue the audience must therefore endure along the way in order to understand it.  The bad guys in this movie are truly bad.  If the Sentinels show up, they are going to kill you, and this is established right away in one of the most exciting superhero/villain fight scenes in any comic book movie to date.  Seeing Colossus become full metal at the same time Sunspot flames on at the same time Iceman (finally) goes and stays full Iceman - a very cool moment.  Unfortunately even these powerhouses are no match for the Sentinels.  The only option is for newly-introduced (but now regular X-Man) Blink to keep them moving around until Shadowcat (with a future developed time/spirit manipulation power) can send newly-introduced Bishop just far enough into the past to warn the team that the Sentinels are approaching - so they can not be there when the Sents arrive.  This is layer one.  Layer two then is this first group combining efforts with the other group (Storm, Wolverine, Prof. X, Magneto) to send someone way back in time to before the Sentinels were even created.  This task falls to Wolverine and off he goes into the second layer (the 1970s, pre-Sentinels) in an effort to stop Mystique from.... wow.  The more I write the more I realize how convoluted this plot is.  It's like trying to explain to a non-viewer what's going on in Game of Thrones.  Pretty soon you just throw your hands up and say, \"You know what?  Just watch it!\"  And so that's what I'll do.  What works in this film is the excellent acting, the dark plot, the nearly-full roster of Superheroes, and the best scene in an X-Men movie since Nightcrawler's debut in X2 (hint:  Quicksilver, and anyone dealing with a Quicksilver or Flash-type character in the future must now contend with this scene setting a certain bar for excellence).  There are a few disappointments.  Anna Paquin will show up as Rogue for a second at the end, and I understand her deleted scene(s) will make it onto a DVD/Bluray version.  But for this primary showing, she's notably and confusingly completely absent.  The action scenes in this movie range from the terrifying Sentinel attacks to the now-typical \"huge Magneto scene\" - this time with him moving an entire sports stadium, to a lot of smaller scenes spread throughout - and they all work.  The special effects are fantastic and nothing feels gratuitous (except when they are going for 100% gratuitous, as in the Quicksilver scene).  The story holds together and the dialogue, while mostly expository, is good.  It's my personal favorite of the series so far (you might be surprised to know that The Last Stand was my favorite until now - typically the one everyone hates - but I'm a sucker for new heroes and villains showing up, and X3 brought a lot of new faces into the series - even if Juggernaut was a huge letdown - the Phoenix climax was epic).  Days of Future Past ups the ante on everything and makes me hungry for the next installment.  I think they're being smart with this series - phasing some actors out and others in - because this bodes well for this being a series with a real lifespan well beyond where we're at now.  If you're new to the series, by all means don't start with this one.  Start at the beginning.  But if you're already an X-Fan, you're most likely going to love this movie.",

X-Men has showed me that in the proper context, with some great writers, superheroes movies don't have to be the lowest form of sci-fi entertainment. Days of Future Past seemed to confuse some people, as it's not part of the trilogy and therefore it's timeline is off. The ending of the film also creates a paradox, which eliminates certain mistakes made in the other films. In layman's terms, some of the things that happen in the other X-Men movies, never happen, because of Days of Future Past. In an undetermined era, sometime between the end of the original film and Last Stand, a new enemy has been targeting mutants. These machines, meant to eliminate the mutants have malfunctioned and are now targeting humans as well. The machines are made with mutant DNA and therefore have the combined forces of all the mutants it's come in contact with, making them unstoppable. The only chance the X-Men have is for one of them to go back in time and stop the machines from ever being built. Wolverine is the only one with a mind strong enough to survive the trip and is sent back to the 1970s, where he meets the cast of X-Men: First Class. While difficult for non-sci-fi aficionados to understand, this film was not only extremely well written, but serves dual purposes for the series. First, it brings both casts together in an extreme fashion and it's a tremendous gift for the fans. Second, it allows the writers to undo mistakes from The Last Stand, which was at the time, set to be the final X-Men film. The ending to Days of Future Past, effectively explain that everything that happened in Last Stand, never happened, as it was part of an alternate timeline. This allows the writers to bring back characters like Prof. X (who is seen killed in that film) for possible future films. It really was an ingenious move for the franchises future, but it also allowed fans to experience the \"old timers\" and the \"new class\" working together, in a huge, diverse, and very impressive cast. Seldom are superheroes films so complicated or as well written as Days of Future Past. The writing is out of this world, the cast is full of stars, and the special effects were absolutely amazing. Love it or hate it, superheroes are part of the science fiction genre, but Days of Future Past was simply incredible and for that, it's our latest must see movie!",

And I thought it's weird he has long hair in the past. Peter Dinklege was the best actor in the movie with him fitting the role nicely. The final fight was epic without spoiling it, I'll say it's awesome. Mystique was a good character for the first half, been the creative with her disguises and development. 2nd half she was a little lacking she was a little annoying as well but not enough to make her bad. The visual effects are so realistic. I honestly thought the moment with Wolverine time travel the effects were good there. Seeing this movie in Real 3D was interesting the 3D effects weren't milked like in Gravity or The Amazing Spider-Man 2. I went in to this movie excited which is strange for me sine I've never watched a X-Men movie (and I will watch them all soon) I was so surprised to that this movie win me over is great. I really loved this movie and if I would I would watch it again in theaters. I recommend this to any fan of X-Men.",

The movie is emotional; not in a very dramatic way but it is able capture its thematic emotion: \"Hope\" because you get to feel some of the characters' feelings of desperation and their path of self destruction, you also get to see that this may fail no matter what you do but at the end hope wins and you get to experience this effectively due to great performances of the main characters.",

Rather than reboot the whole shebang or focus on a specific First Class sequel, Singer instead doubles-down and incorporates old and new.

But now, in 2014, director of Superman Returns- Bryan Singer comes with another level of high class, well acted Xmen, with good results. The first think I want to say is that Days of Future Last isn't your typical action fulled, popcorn movie. If you like the comics or are familier with the characters and storylines, it's good to go for you. Some movies are so gripping and they stay so true to their comics and origins- DOFP is that type of movie. The Xmen send Wolverine played by Hugh Jackman in the past to stop the war that came in the future. Hugh Jackman was really good in this movie. Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen were the highlights. Jennifer Lawrence and Halle Berry were there but they were normal fare. This is the most absorbing and greatest Xmen movie ever know in recent years, it deserves the hype, and sure as damn deserves this much pride. This is what Tarantino did to Pulp Fiction, what Nolan did to The Dark Knight, what Kubrick did to Clockwork Orange. This is real cinema. I think I have never watched a movie so exciting and refreshing. You walk out of the theatre felling a sense of joy or spotting those Easter eggs with your friends and family. That is why movies are made. And DOFP is just that and even more. Why wait? Devour this excellent piece of filmmaking.",

Nothing feels squandered or easily earned here, and so many wrongs have been righted.

I walked out of the theater feeling like part of me had actually been saved, and that my love and hope for this franchise, this world, had been rewarded.

Walking into this film, I knew the time-travel aspect could enable the franchise to do more things and subtract installations that knee-capped it (Last Stand, Origins: Wolverine). Now onto the film ignoring that novelty; this film's story is bleak and it is really not afraid to express that. Some scenes feel like Dark Souls, but with weight. The story is that Wolverine is sent back via Kitty Pryde's powers to the early 70's to unite a depressed Charlies Xavier and incarcerated Erik Lensher to undo Mystique's act which pretty much dooms everyone. Also, Logan has to cope with the inconvenience that since he's sent back before the Weapon X project, he only has his bone claws. That's as much plot as I want to give away. Because the movie is running off of virtually two ensemble casts, any one with any dialogue of significance being a damn good actor. What's awesome is that even though the bulk of the film takes place in the past, Bryan Singer's trademarks of it being an X-men film are more prominent than Matthew Vaughn, First Class's director and this one's co-writer: It's theme is a reprise of X2's theme accompanied by a creative CG intro with a monologue by Patrick Stewart. It's focus when not on action, is just smart dialogue (this is an executive producer of House we're talking about here). The only two pieces of advice I give to those going seeing is to see X-men, X2, Last Stand (if you see the bad one before this, you'll appreciate what this film does), and First Class and prepare for a comic-book film darker than Captain America: The Winter Soldier.",

Did I mention Jennifer Lawrence....lol  smoking hot when she transforms into a blue skin tight mutant is something to see. This weekend will be a busy one at the theatres. Block Buster for sure. I went to the Great Escape at the Harrisburg East Mall on the east shore. The east shore people for the most part dont know when to shut there FAT LIPS UP. On two occasions I had to stand up and tell a group of east shore people to shut the heck up, people are here to watch a movie, not to hear your fat lips flapping in the wind. I got clapped at for the one to have the balls to tell them to shut up. Then security came in and all was cool. And please you fat girls with cellulite, dont wear skin tight shorts or spandex, It makes people want to vomit, look in the mirror before you go out in public. The Regal Harrisburg 14 off of Progress Ave. and Caughey Drive is a great theater also but dont draw in the Harrisburg City crowd for the most part. I went to the midnite showing hoping the theater wouldn't have many people in it since it was Thursday night and I wouldn't have to deal with the type of people that show up at The Great Escape in the Harrisburg East Mall, which is a Regal theater also. But It had a good bit of people in it anyway. I still enjoyed the movie after the Security Guards came in. Yes, Security Guards to keep the A Holes in check. Go see this flick, you won't regret it. I love The Great Escape but not the near by people that show up on drugs and are disrespectful. Stay to the very very very end even when the lights come on and see if you can make sense of a 60 second clip. That one I can't figure out. If you can, please let me know. It was cool,  just made everyone scratch there heads, LOL....Hope you enjoy the movie as much as I did. Just ask management to pop in once and a while to tell the rude people to shut up or leave. If you experience the same issue I did. The Great Escape is 1 of 2 of my favorite movie theaters. They have a great staff. I live 5 minutes away from Camp Hill Cinama Center but drive 20 minutes to the Great Escape because number 1 as I stated the staff is great and number 2 the chairs are cosy and just has a great atmosphere not to mention the sound is great. Dont get me wrong, your not always going to have to deal with the A Holes like I did tonite, but if you do just get a staff member to come in and put them in there place or the best thing to do is ask  management or security staff to check in once in awhile, that way you dont miss any of the movie with your hard earned cash. If you were wondering what other theater is in my top 2 best theater list, It is The Regal off Progress Ave. and Caughey Drive as I mentioned in this review.",

The directors have so many other X-Men but Wolverine is the most popular and he is a cash cow. I guess it kind of makes sense with the plot in this one but still. He is bland and he hardly even fights. Mystique is alright in the film. She is basically there so Wolverine has something to do but it gets the job done. Magneto is complicated because you cannot tell what he is going to do. In one scene he is about to kill Mystique before she tries to kill the creator of the Sentinels but then later he tries to send a message to the world by trying to kill the very same person she was trying to kill. The best part of the movie is Quicksilver but he gets used for one or two scenes then the movie just drops him like his powers cannot help them in some other way, for instance, I don't know, finding Mystique! Also, Quicksilver mentions that his mom went out with a man who could control metal but then the subject never gets brought up again. I mean, come on! Why bring it up if you're not going to use it? Basically, mutants are being hunted, Wolverine is the only one who can save the day by going back in time and rounding up Charles and Magneto to team up but of course it is not going to be easy, even though Wolverine says that future is doomed if they don't work together. Magneto tries to do it his way because of angst and Charles is still upset that he took his girlfriend away. Big deal. There is also way too much talking and not enough action. Don't let the beginning of the movie fool you. There isn't going to be more action until near the end. I know that they are trying to set up the plot and go into some detail but jeez. I thought that Wolverine was going to do his taxes at some point. But I will say that Wolverine can hold his breath under water a really long time. And his body sure is tough enough to break metal right off even though it is pierced around his whole body...and well you get the idea. Maybe it is because it's a dream to him that it doesn't really affect him. Maybe... Also, I do not like how, at the end, Bryan Singer (The Director) basically says **** you to the first three X-Men movies and brought everyone back to life setting the movie up perfectly for a sequel. I guess Magneto isn't the main antagonist anymore? Or the fact that the future never happening maybe means that Magneto and Charles never get along. I don't know. That's up to the director of the next movie to decide. Wait, can't Charles just mind warp those future images into Magneto so that he remembers they are friends now? Oh well.

It looks much less natural and fake;  the filmmakers also seem too shy to show Mystique for more than a split second at a time. Also, now that we know there is a method for going back in time whenever it is convenient, all future drama (if there are more movies) is wiped out, because if someone dies, if anything else goes wrong, they can just send Wolverine back in time to fix it.

It wasn't until 2011 that Matthew Vaughn sparked some new life into the series, by telling a rousing origin story that almost felt like a reboot to the franchise. Re-enter Singer, who brings the best of both his films and Vaughn\u2019s \u201cX-Men: First Class\u201d by; combining the dark, seedy plotting of his first two movies with energized period stylings of \"First Class\". All this is achieved, while blending the fantastic cast of both films via an inventive time traveling plot that surprisingly works on all levels. Based on the comic book story-line of the same name; Wolverine is sent to the past by Kitty Pride (since when could she do that) in an attempt to change history and prevent an event that results in the Sentinel program; a program that dooms both humans and mutants. Little (and sometimes noticeable) characterizations that contradicts the previous films does bother the geek inside me, and I\u2019m sure many can agree; but I\u2019m willing to forgive and forget this time around. By incorporating socio-political topics (typical of X-Men) with an intriguing sci-fi premise \"Days of Future Past\" does far more than just entertain. But what I liked most was the balance of characters on display and the performances behind them. Whether it\u2019s James McAvoy\u2019s world-weary younger Xavier, Michael Fassbender\u2019s morally disturbed younger Magneto or their introspective older selves (Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen, respectively); the cast members bask in whatever limelight the film affords them. Though I\u2019m still not convinced of Jennifer Lawrence\u2019s rendition of Mystique, I appreciate what the writers were doing with character\u2019s arc. \u201cDays of Future\u201d is fast, smart; most of our characters are well developed and effectively reintroduced; even lesser characters get their fleeting moments to shine. The sparing action sequences were well staged; and one thing I always admired about Singer was his way of defining the characters' abilities through elaborately staged set pieces. Kudos to that Quicksilver slow-mo scene. The dystopian future and vintage period setting was brought to life by nice production designs and the visual effects dazzle unlike any other X-Men film. It\u2019s up there as one of the finest X-Men films (second only to \u201cX2: X-Men United\u201d) and certainly one of the better superhero films in recent times. Entertainment is guaranteed!",

Bishop was undersold. 3. The Sentinels didn't say anything...(in the comics and on the show they always said mutant detected) 4. THe Sentinels looked like the Destroyer from the first Thor movie. 5. Where the HELL was Scarlet  Witch (maybe they are saving her for the Avengers 3 movie where they will have Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver join the Avengers). There are more things i find wrong with this movie but I guess by now you get the point! Days of Future Past was by far the best X-men movie but I sincerely hope Fox gives up the rights to X-men or better yet at least collaborate with Marvel Studios on the next X-men movie, seeing as how the Movie will more than likely have Apocalypse (X-men The Age of Apocalypse) which might introduce Archangel.

There are a lot of characters, plotlines, and relationships as the film tries to continue the story from both First Class and The Last Stand while tying these together. While the film did feel like a little too much at times everything felt necessary for the story and it was all balanced well. Brian Synger returns to give us one of the better films in the franchise with fun action, an engaging story, and great characters with lots of solid relationships. Fans of the three X-Men films that are considered good (1, 2, and First Class) will enjoy this movie as it is another solid entry and the ending will make diehard fans extremely happy. It may not be the best X-Men film, best superhero film, or best of the summer but considering how this franchise was struggling five years ago it\u2019s a miracle its been able to bounce back without completely rebooting itself. While I wish the franchise would just end on this film as the ending does provide a nice sense of closure, especially for the future storyline, they are going to continue. If this franchise is destined to go on for a while, my only hope is that it we keep the ball in the air continuing to provide fun and entertaining films for many years to come.",

This film is viscerally relentless in spectacular fight scenes and moments of pure speculation on our characters which weaves beautifully and brutally into the chaotic future it so holds. However, I do not prefer this one over first class. That is unprecedented in my personal opinion. The main issue being in it's subtlety. There are a few sequences which seem to pile on explanation as 'would you believe I'm from the future?' with a comedic moment. Although in some scenarios, it is well done. A moment that works especially well is the one on one with Xavier and Xavier, and from a conclusive standpoint, it works artfully well. For me, X-men days of future past is not as fantastic as First Class, and in some ways lacks. But as a symbolic resolution, this is impressively fun and presents a relevant moral message that we can all follow, and even has the guts to make it conspicuous in it's development whilst proving that there are no true lefts or rights to each character, much like mutants, we are a complex mesh.

Hugh Jackman gets to be the star again in this movie like most of the others, but at least he's not to bad at it. It's nice to see the use of characters in this movie to, seeing they are dealing with time travel and to sets of mutants it gives them lots to work it. The story is can seem very complex at times witch is a nice change but some may get lots in the time travel and who is who.",

      "text": "\"X-Men: Days of Future Past\" is yet another great step in the right direction. The return of director Bryan Singer had helped the production of this film to make it the best film in the series ( aside from Deadpool if you count that as an X-Men film). The stakes are raised to a higher level as humanity and mutant kind are enslaved by the Sentitles which are robots created for the sole purpose of hunting down mutants. The Sentitles are given a needed update as they have Mystique's power to shape-shift and copy powers to attack their targets. These machines were brutal as the tore people apart and shoot down anything in their path. The film than has Wolverine time travel back to the time line of \"First Class\". Some had concerns of Wolverine's inclusion in the film since he ad a habit of being the main focus of the other films but thankfully he has a limited role in this film as he is only their to be the metaphorical bridge between both timeline's. Each character feels changed as a result of the events of this film for better or worse and each one has been given more depth than any of the prior films. The one who truly Steals the show is Peter Dinklage as Bolivar Trask. This iteration of the character has an interesting unstated motivation to destroying these mutants which is implied to be pure jealously which makes his interactions with the mutants interesting to watch. Quicksilver was another great addition with the sequence of his super-speed from his prospective. The slow motion and the music really gives an out-of-body experience on that sequence that I had yet to see another Comic-book film. The action sequences are well choreographed and intense with a lot of attention to detail. It is impressive to have so much happening on screen but still be able to distinguish what is going on. This film is must-see for an superhero let alone X-Man fan.",
