I do find it quite annoying the professional film critics write a bout a film based on a novel without bothering to first read the novel.  Many films of this ilk are hammered for NOT being true to the original and this one is being panned for  doing so, damned if one does damned of one doesn't. I understand that this film will probably be completely incomprehensible to most American audiences, and one criticism that I do have is that the film is weakened by the attempts to make it more accessible,  the producers should I believe have gone all out and made a film for British audiences and hopped that it transferred (\" Four Weddings\", \"Downton Abby\", etc).",

This movie is a little strange but i really have fun with some jokes, but another just simply were flat and obvious...I think the biggest problem with it is that the sequences were much longer and they just put some scenes unecessary that makes the story go slowly. I think people are only making this movie a disaster because of Deep, who as always and no matter the movie, is great  but i want to see him as a real actor and not a caricature or a simple copy of Jack Sparrow, and the supporting actors like Paltrow, McGregor and especially Bettany are good additions...At the end, is not a disaster that many say, but i can understand because it has some fun but was stupid like that \"balls scene\" and even boring.
