The movie is little more than a series of drab cliches, strung together is a plodding and predictable manner. It limps, coughs , and stutters along, never getting off the ground; and finally ends with \"and everyone lived happily ever after\" that would embarrass the director  of a G (for gooey sweet) movie aimed at a six year old audience level. While Amy Adams, and John Goodman give sophisticated, nuanced, and strong performances, they only serve to show up how very bad the movie is. Justin Timberlake is egregiously miscast to play opposite Amy Adams, and he comes off as a high school drama club reject... when compared against Adam's exceptional performance. I am a long time fan of Clint Eastwood, and wish I could give at least a warm review to this film. However, as I and one other person were the only people sitting in a theater that could accommodate hundreds, this afternoon it is hard to miss the obvious. My advice: skip the popcorn, you'll have more than enough old chestnuts to chew on. Better yet, rent an old Clint Eastwood film, and enjoy him in his glory days.",

The story was extremely formulaic and predictable, but the actors give a solid performance.  Clint basically plays the same curmudgeon he was in \"Gran Torino\".  The way he treats his daughter is borderline cruel and not believable.  Justin Timberlake is also not believable as an athlete and occasionally his \"rap accent\" is noticeable.  I know he's not a rapper but still he talks like one.  This is the first movie I've seen him in and his acting was passable, but I just didn't believe him as being an ex big league pitcher.  He's too small.  The ending was all tied up neatly in a pretty Hollywood bow.  Every problem was resolved.  Not quite original enough for me to recommend.",
