I've been in the  big girl world; had a business to run and recieved  kudos (& bumps/bruises) that go with that world. BUT there is nothing like the (to borrow a 50's term) pink ghetto.  Where roles are not as clearly defined; right & wrong are a little hazy (not to mention crazy)  some days and you would sell the contents of your entire house for 5 minutes of peace & quiet.  Am I a homeschooling mom - nope - but I know that the situations depicted here can & do happen - ask any cop, medical personnel, or pastors family of which I have experience in all 3 areas. Many times truth is stranger than fiction.  This movie delievers some powerfulful messages -  loved Bones & the very subtle don't judge by apperances. Loved the mom blogger - I've been there & survived & yes -there were many days (&nights;) where that was in question (any sane mom/dad that denies this is definitely high on the weird side). Loved the pastor's wife - she expresses some real fears & a couple of interesting observations. The single mom - good job - never a good idea to get between her & her baby.  Major thanks to all who dealt with this subject in such an intelligent and respectfull way.  Knowing you would be flogged by critics yet trusting the people who are there & have  been there to validate the humor & content of this movie was a wise move.  I am honored to stand along side this movie & say thanks & yes - I get it so moms go & get it & have a great moms nigt out!",

Trace Adkins was fantastic as Bones. But, some of my favorite scenes were with Robert Amaya. We loved him in Courageous and in this movie, he had us laughing until we were crying. I attended the movie with 4 of my kids ages 16-24 - two sons and 2 daughters. The boys pretty much were going just to take me for Mother's Day - not that they thought it would be that funny. Throughout the movie, they were laughing just as hard as the girls and I were. I went with fairly low expectations - knowing that sometimes \"Christian\" movies do not have the same level of acting or writing as some mainstream movies. This one far exceeded my expectations. The acting was first class - I can't think of one actor that was a weak link in this film. The writing was fantastic! So nice to see that there are writers who actually have ideas besides using profanity or crudity to cover for their lack of inspiration!",
